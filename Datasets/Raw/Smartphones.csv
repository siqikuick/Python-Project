‎B0BCQXXRJJ,Google Pixel 7 – Unlocked Android 5G Smartphone with 12 megapixel camera and 24-hour battery – Obsidian,Smartphones,S$930.00,https://www.amazon.sg/Google-Pixel-Unlocked-Smartphone-megapixel/dp/B0BCQXXRJJ/ref=sr_1_4?qid=1695968215&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051%2Cp_72%3A6469119051%2Cp_36%3A20000-150000&rnid=6450031051&s=electronics&sr=1-4,https://www.amazon.sg/Google-Pixel-Unlocked-Smartphone-megapixel/product-reviews/B0BCQXXRJJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,4.4,"[""My 1-month review: If you are like me and watched a lot of tech reviews and read a lot of articles, then you probably already know this is a great phone for the price point. Truth be told, I was very skeptical of this phone because I saw a lot of reviews on the Pixel 6 mentioning that there were a lot of software bugs that made everyday use really inconvenient. However, with the Pixel 7, so far, I haven't had too many issues with it besides initially, not being aware that you need very specific charging cables and blocks for it to actually charge. If you want tech video, you should already know this but the camera quality is AMAZING, though, it does sometimes struggle with low-light shots. The face and fingerprint unlock works great, though, this might change for you if you decide to get a screen protector. I am also a big fan of some of the new features such as live transcription during a phone call, auto-transcription for voicemails, live translation, and auto-ID songs. Just an FYI for people considering this phone, you can purchase this phone via the Google store, however, the return policy is 15 days compared to Amazon's return policy of 30 days.Fair warning: The package ONLY comes with the phone and USB-C charger. You will need to buy the charging block separately. Also, only certain charging cables/charging blocks work with this phone, which is kind of annoying. Don't be like me! When I first got the phone, I thought I had a faulty phone because it won't charge so I had to temporarily use a USB-C laptop charger until the charging block came."", ""Update 2/19/23. So last update Amazon graciously gave me a very fair partial refund even though it was outside the 2 month window. (I owned the phone for 4 mos and 2 days) And I have sent the pixel 7 back to them. Google customer service continues to be abysmal. Overall phone was not better than pixel 2 for me, but aside from all my issues still a decent value and I still like Pixel phones better than the competition. Read on if you desire to see my trials and tribulations with the Pixel 7. So I finally got around to working through the warranty process (for cracked rear camera lens) with Google and was put in touch with a local ubreakit/wefixit shop who promptly told me it wasn't covered(incidental damage). I was quoted $249 to repair. I declined and contacted Amazon again who proceeded to offer me a very fair partial refund which I accepted and sent the phone back. I am back to using my pixel 2 which still works better for me, while I regroup and figure out what is next. Thanks Amazon you are absolutely fantastic you didn't have to make this right and you did, so thanks,  and if you make a smartphone I would love to buy it. Google customer service your lucky I still like the pixel because you are absolutely atrocious to work with.Update 1/14/23 on the plus side it appears that the USB c port issues were software related, it stopped having issues after the last update. So that is a win.I contacted Amazon about the broken camera lens it appears this is a common issue on Pixel 7s due to a manufacturing error in producing the glass. Apparently they shatter due to internal stress. Amazon told me that they couldn't help me because it was outside the 2 month return window. But it has a one year warranty by Google. I reached out to Google for the warranty claim and I received an email from a company lawyer saying if I was sueing them about the issue they have received my information and would email me back. I haven't heard anything since. I imagine I will have to contact them again. But only the wide angle camera is affected and I don't use that. So overall I am actually pretty happy with this phone. And now that the USB c port works again it does everything I need. I hear pixel 8 is smaller so will see when that one comes out. Adding a star because everything I care about works now. Google customer service sucks, but still wouldn't pay $1200 for a comparable iphone or Samsung.Update 12/3/22I have started having issues with the USB C port it doesn't grab the cable tightly and causes issues with Android auto and often if I attempt to charge by cable it will appear to be charging and than won't. I have cleaned it out, but no obvious debris. I bought this first day available and received it October 17, so not quite two months. I have worked around this using a wireless charger but still data xfer and android auto are a problem.Additionally I bought and use a Spigen case and screen protector, but I pulled it out of my pocket and found the glass shattered above the camera lens.  I am guessing that I leaned against something with it in my pocket but I didn't drop it or violate it in an obvious manner.  I definitely need a phone that I can carry in my pocket and that is adequately protected with a case and screen protector although a nice phone maybe not durable enough for me. Never had an issue with pixel 2 on the durability front.Fortunately both the camera and phone still work but definitely not tracking for another four year performance.Original review -I have been using this phone for a little over a month. I upgraded from a pixel 2.Pros- Good battery life, updates and is supported for the next 3 years.Cons-Significantly larger than pixel 2, fingerprint scanner is almost unusable.There is a lot of reviews on the cameras and how great they are, I'm sure they are excellent for my uses the pixel 2 was more than adequate and this one is also more than adequate.The fingerprint reader is a problem, the pixel 2 worked almost flawlessly for the 4 years I used it every day. The pixel 7 might work 2 out of 10 times maybe 1 out of ten, it is so inconsistent that I really can't use it for biometric authentication. I have read the fixes and troubleshooting, none of it really works, I'm not going to carry a fingerprint wetter around with me.I think a lot of the things that drove me to upgrade, were do to Google refusing to support the Pixel 2 it received its last update at the end of 2020 and it started a few months ago to experience buggy performance with connectivity and the GPS, with no real fixes due to being two revs behind on Android.For me the fingerprint scanner and size combined with a brand new pixel 2, makes it a better phone than the pixel 7. Unfortunately I can't go back in time and can only hope that in four years pixel 12 is smaller and has a functional fingerprint scanner.The 7 is a good phone and at $500 it is an excellent value. They certainly have upgraded the cameras and the tensor system works well. I certainly am glad I went this route over the other options.I just think there is a point where some of the driving features, cameras, operating systems, weird swipe modes etc are really not noticeably better and drive up cost and size and lead to removal of things I would like such as a stand alone fingerprint scanner and 3.5 mm jack. Hope Google reads this"", ""I didn't want this phone. My Pixel5 died rather suddenly (likely bc I'd stated to someone aloud how much I liked it and wanted to keep it as long as possible) and I was forced to replace it. I read reviews on new Pixel phones even when I'm not planning to upgrade what I have so I was aware that the 7 still had some of the same annoying bugs as the 6 and was more or less prepared to be annoyed with this phone.So far, it's been fine. It's big. I don't really need the extra screen size but whatever. I miss the dedicated fingerprint reader on the back of my 5 so much. It was perfect. It worked every time and was located right where your index finger rests anyway.I dislike screen based readers (I don't like the one on my Samsung tablet either). And I was prepared to hate this one given the issues people have reported.It's actually fine, if you DON'T use a screen protector. I didn't bother with one on my 5 (Caseology cases have a nice lip on them that keeps the screen off most surfaces and I'm not generally hard on my phones) and wouldn't have on this one except I couldn't get a Caseology case for it fast enough and this phone is SLICK and I don't mean visually (though I suppose it's that, too, but I have it in a case so who cares?) there is literally NO traction at all when holding this thing. It's downright slippery and will migrate down any surface you set it on that's not flat. So, I feared I'd end up scratching the thing before I could get proper protection for it and got some screen protectors for it.Fingerprint reader became almost instantly unusable and that didn't really improve even after a few weeks. I like using biometrics for lots of apps so I ended up removing the screen protector and it's fine again. It still only likes the inside edge of my left thumb but will read that very consistently so I'm fine with it.Still annoyed I had to replace my 5 even if it was 2 years old, but this hasn't been as annoying as I feared. That said, jury is still out on long-term stability and function.I'm firmly on Team Pixel (I had an original Pixel XL first) and likely will be as long as Google doesn't royally mess something up, but it's mostly because I love the pure, unadulterated Android OS experience and getting updates quickly, etc. I feel like any Pixel phone is a good choice for that reason alone."", ""I was forced to buy a new phone after my Pixel 4a5G suddenly, inexplicably died.  The Pixel 7 was my logical choice (I could absolutely not justify spending nearly twice as much for the 7 Pro model!!!)AMAZON DELIVERED THE NEW PHONE IN LESS THAN 10 HOURS!!!!!  They have an amazing system in place.  What an excellent item to have available for delivery THAT quickly!  When you have no cell phone - you feel completely lost!  VERY much appreciated.The fingerprint scanner on my 5a5G is on the REAR, where it is an instant, no-brainer to simply touch it as you pick up the phone.  It was also 100% accurate and WORKED EVERY TIME.  Economics probably dictated that Google remove the rear scanner and install that functionality into the front screen instead.  Even before I installed the excellent glass screen protector on my Pixel 7 it was quite obvious that it was not as good as that on my 4a5G.  After I installed the protector the reliability became VERY poor.  Sure, there are some protectors that are supposedly 'classified' to somehow be better qualified to work with front scanners...but I doubt it.  I have found though that even with the protector installed, there is a very specific orientation and pressure that will correctly unlock the phone within two tries about 80-90% of the time.  Good enough I guess.Also, I'm also not convinced that the Pixel phone screen needed to be made taller and narrower.  I think I like the screen ratio of the 4a5G better.The Pixel 7 does appear to be significantly faster & more responsive than my 4a5G.NOTE:Nothing at all against the Pixel 7 hardware; Google's software folks do a fantastic job of making it easy to transition to a new Pixel phone - IF YOUR PREVIOUS PHONE IS STILL WORKING - If your old phone is dead, like mine was - not so much!  Though the transition software functionality is definitely in place - it is not well stated or described at all!  It would go a VERY long way if Google would simply put up on the new phone's screen a clear, precise, and in layman's terms, an explanation that 'EVEN IF YOUR PREVIOUS PHONE IS DEAD/UNAVAILABLE DATA/SETTINGS CAN BE RESTORED FROM THE CLOUD' and provide details of the restoration process from Google's cloud backup of your previous phone (assuming that feature was left turned on when the user originally purchased that).Google needs to take a close look at their instructions.  Things that are obvious and self-explanatory to folks that write them and/or just deal with them on a regular basis doesn't mean they will be clear to many other people.I had previously been EXTREMELY impressed a couple years ago when transitioning from my old Huawei phone to the Pixel 4a5g.  The Huawei was still in working order and the transition process was incredibly easy and thorough.  Google seems to have spent an incredible amount of time and effort into that situation/process ... but skimped on the details of other scenarios.  Room for improvement."", 'Llego justo totslmwnte nuevo y todo funciona muy bien', ""I have been a loyal Samsung user but decided to try the Google Pixel 7. There are several things I like and several I don't. I don't have a gallery for photos like Samsung I would prefer to have my photos stored on my phone maybe this is available but the default seems to be Google photos.There are fewer setting options than the Samsung for example I like different notification sounds per application, I seem to be only able to select one sound option for all apps on the pixel and the sound options are poor.The camera seems to be better but there are fewer options for example with the self timer and settings in general.The phone gets very hot and especially when I connect it to Android Auto in my car. I have had the phone warn me it was too hot and had to unplug it and wait for it to cool down. Not really impressive to say the least.I bought the phone for the Esim functionality and have used it once when traveling to another country it worked well and I was able to have mobile data for fractions of what my carrier charges. This is a great feature that wasn't available on my Samsung.Overall the phone is fine. The running hot is a concern but I have only had the phone a few weeks so not really enough time to provide a better evaluation. For the price it was good value but we will see if it lasts because the running hot is a concern for sure."", ""Overall, this is a great phone, especially at the Summer 2023 price. It's a no-brainer. Amazing camera and digital processing. All the Google AI and smarts. Integrates with your life. Freedom to choose in so many aspects of the phone. The fingerprint sensor could be better though but it shouldn't be enough to deter you.TIP: A film screen protector will get you about a 95% success rate with the fingerprint sensor. If you decide to go with glass, you may lose some of that accuracy. Be sure to register your primary finger twice.Great value."", ""It took a little while to get used to the Pixel 7 and having Samsung phones for years.  But the Pixel is half the price and works well.  Allowed us to go to an alternative carrier and didn't have to finance the phone through Verizon."", ""The phone is the most vanilla android phone you can get,  the camera is great,  guaranteed first round updates for 3 years.  The Google processor is still early to the field though, it struggles with keeping tasks performing at their best abs drains the battery very quickly.  You can't beat it for the value,  but I certainly wish the processor was as premium as the rest of the phone"", 'Producto en buen estado, buen funcionamientoTodo sellado y empaquetado']"

‎B0BCQS263K,Google Pixel 7 – Unlocked Android 5G Smartphone with 12 megapixel camera and 24-hour battery – Obsidian,Smartphones,S$714.00,https://www.amazon.sg/Google-Pixel-Unlocked-Smartphone-megapixel/dp/B0BCQS263K/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1695968215&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051%2Cp_72%3A6469119051%2Cp_36%3A20000-150000&rnid=6450031051&s=electronics&sr=1-6,https://www.amazon.sg/Google-Pixel-Unlocked-Smartphone-megapixel/product-reviews/B0BCQS263K/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,4.3,"['I\'m coming off a Galaxy S10 and before that an LG G6. I\'ve also purchased Samsung A51 and S20 FE\'s for my parents. To get the negatives out of way. Side or rear mounted finger print sensors are so much more consistent. Samsung also provides a lot of applications that can be pretty nice like their SoundAssistant app where I can change how the volume button increments/decrements.Using the Firefox app, I can do screenshots that scroll the page on the Samsungs while on this Pixel Mozilla needs to update their app to implement the Google API to support scrolling screenshots and there are probably other apps that I would be able to do scrolling+stitched  screenshots on the Samsungs but not this Pixel. There are other things like more options in the long press context menus that make doing things faster on the Samsung compared to the Google Pixels.Default launcher on the Pixel has this full width data/weather/info widget that you can\'t remove. It only takes up a little less than a third of the width of the screen. It is a waste of space. If I need the date, I just swipe open the notification menu. Weather, I used the Google weather widget on my Samsung Galaxy but the smallest one that takes up like 2 horizontal app icon widths so I can fit 2 more icons on the row. The button to clear all in the task switcher, you have to swipe all the way to left end rather than just having it always there as a lower row under the application windows. AnnoyingEvery default launcher these days do gestures for going back and opening the app/multitasking switcher. I\'ve tried for years and always go back to enabling the bottom menu with the back, home, and task switcher buttons.Gaming and emulation performance on the Qualcomm based Samsungs are a lot better. Samsung provides 1 more year of support compared to Google. Honestly almost everything is better with a Samsung phone than a Pixel. But they are expensive. If I do get into phone games and emulation more though, I\'ll probably go back to a Qualcomm based Samsung device unless the future AMD GPU Exynos Tensor have drivers as mature and with application developer support like Qualcomm chipsets do.Outside of all that, aesthetically it looks really nice. They made the buttons in the notification menu way bigger (slower to use than the industrial looking small icons in the Samsung default launcher). Only fits 4 quick actions before having to swipe down fully to get 8 quick actions - swipe left/right for more. For some reason google combined the wi-fi and mobile networks toggle into one so you have to click it, then click the radio button to turn off the wi-fi. Some of the notification collapsing into applications make some app notification utilities more annoying to use toThe fingerprint reader. You may have to redo your fingerprints a couple times to get it well responsive. It\'s good for me now. Still fails far more often than my previous phones. End up having to use pattern unlock.Google lens is nice. Fast to get to do the camera point at stuff and it translates. Could already do that with the Google Translate app on any phone. I\'m happy with the battery life. I know it\'s better on the S23. I\'ve gotten used to this 6.3"" disaplay. Not sure if I\'d prefer a 6.1"" display. Phone is real smooth besides games. Tried DraStic, Citra, and Tower of Fantasy. Tower of Fantasy performance is not great. DraStic and Citra have surprisingly crashed on me.I was thinking I would hype this phone up compared to Samsung phones but it hasn\'t worked out that way. The main thing is really the aesthetics of the phone. I suppose the camera is nice and faster but I have Sony A7III and for photos compositions matter more than gear. I\'m not blown away by camera performance compared to a S10E or what I see from people with iPhones and newer Galaxy phones. Low light performance is definitely miles of an upgrade over an S10E. Still, photography is all about composition and lighting and what you do in Darktable/Lightroom.I miss the 3.5mm port. I use bluetooth in the car for a different device so I needed 3.5mm adapter to connect audio to my car. At home my bluetooth audio is a class D amplifier and over ear Sony noice cancelling headphones. Sometimes I\'m laying down and just want to put on some 3.5mm earbuds. I need another USB-C to 3.5mm adapter so I don\'t have to keep remembering to carry the one in my car everywhere. I don\'t think I\'ll get over the loss of 3.5mm jacks because of how much audio equipment I have. I\'m never buying those Google Airpod knockoffs nor the Samsung ones.After having this phone for a month and then writing this review, I don\'t notice the visual UI aesthetics anymore. It\'s not truly a plus for me anymore. I\'ve gotten over it. It\'s a good phone but Samsung does an extra year of major OS and security updates over Google. The Google Tensor is already not as good as Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 let alone the 8 Gen 2. I can wait one year and potentially buy the 1 year old Galaxy phone with a better chipset for the price of a new Pixel. Buying this 256GB version for $600 when the Samsung S23 was going for $800 is nice thoughWanted to overall positive with the review. Still really good phone because modern phones are all overall hit all the basics - even the cheap phones. If the future Tensor processors with AMD GPUs aren\'t competitive with Samsungs in gaming/emulation support, the only reason I\'d be buying a Pixel is the price.', ""So far, I've had OnePlus phones (last was a 7pro), a cheap Samsung and this one.  The Pixel has a better UI to it and I like it almost as much as the One Plus 7pro I had.  I will never get another cheap Samsung again. The UI was clearly a step down from the OnePlus and the Pixel 7.  Yeah, it's a cheaper phone and performance, camera, etc. wasn't as good, but the UI was awful.  Can't help but extrapolate that to the whole Samsung line.  Considering how expensive their flagship phones are, why try one if the UI on the cheap ones suck.The Pixel UI has been easy to use and easier to learn the quirks than the OnePlus and a lot easier than the Samsung.  If I had to pick one word to describe learning the UI, I'd say quick. It went quick. Features on the cheap Samsung were often harder to find and sometimes hard to get set the way I wanted them.The Pixel's camera is better than the OnePlus 7pro (known trade off) and way ahead of the cheap Samsung as would be expected.  The camera is also easy to use so far.  I haven't found much in the way of complex settings to tweak.  Nice zoom, but not spectacular.  Color is great and focus works pretty well.  Pixel count is high enough that it kind of makes up for the Nice but not spectacular zoom.  With it zoomed in to max it's relatively easy to crop down to the precise thing you want without losing so much detail everything starts looking fuzzy.Have not had the drop outs and coverage issues I had with both the OnePlus and Samsung.  Reception is solid and the blue tooth range is great.  Leaving the phone sit, I can get at least 40 feet away with a couple walls in between before my wireless earbuds (BBTek) start to loose the signal.Overall, I rate it as a great value compared to the latest flagship phones.  If you're thinking about the latest flagship but balking at the cost, the Pixel 7 is a great alternative.  Google is an amoral entity and possibly somewhat evil, but compared to something that's ultimately subject to the whims of the Chinese government (Oppo, OnePlus, etc.) and a crappy UI on the Samsung, I'll go with them for now."", 'Good phone. Charger is not included.', 'I\'ve been in the Apple eco system since iPhone 1, but I\'m also an avid *NIX user so a few years back I made the leap to Pixel (and specifically Pixel 7 last year).  The Pixel 7 is a phone with lots of potential, but botched by poor execution of the basics.  Here are some pro\'s and con\'s:Pro: Rapid software updates from Google. You get in front of the line of other Android phones.Con: Software is BUGGY.  i.e., phone rings and the answer button disappears?! keeps ringing until the call ends with no way to answer it... WTH.Pro: Great camera.  You get a flagship-worthy camera with great night shots..Con: Cinematic video/bokeh is still far behind Apple.Pro: Tensor flow... lots of potential on the new TPU.Con: Apple\'s Bionic processor still comes up around 2x faster.Pro: Always-on display with better refresh rates.Con: Pain to use...  notifications are wonky when display is always-on and don\'t show up (Android bug)... and you won\'t know (for example) when an email or text comes in when the display is always on... I just shut it off the always-on so I can get my notifications correctly/normally.  poor execution/poorly thought out.Con: BATTERY/charging.  This is the BIGGEST botch job on this phone.  Even when you have a charger in hand, chances are it wont charge.  Lots of BS workaround posted online like ""cleaning the plug"", using a different cable, patching the OS, hard starting, factory reset, turning off adaptive charging, etc... it won\'t charge.  The phone goes into a mode that it acknowledges its connected to a charger but will refuse to charge.  Be it USB-C PD, USB2, USB1, wireless charging, whatever.  If you\'re on travel, THIS IS THE WRONG PHONE TO BRING WITH YOU!  Trust me on this.  You will thank me later by following this advice.More on the battery: the charger is a proprietary charging circuit from Huawei I think, and it has bugs... lots of them.  So far, I don\'t think its thermal... and its definitely not mechanical.  About 20% of the time, I wake up in the morning and pick my phone thats been in the charger all night to see it only has 5-10% after charging all night... no reason given.  Next day, its fine.Even more on the battery: so... Android/Pixel does have a battery saver mode... sounds great!  This is a good emergency countermeasure for a broken charge circuit, right?  So you switch on Power Saver... then you plug into the charger (hoping to reduce usage if the charging fails)... but what happens is that Android now says ""Connected, Not Charging"" and since its ""connected"" it shuts off the power saver!!!! Yes... if that sounds ridiculous... thats because it is... So now your phone is not charging *AND* its burning through the battery twice as fast!  If you had 5-6% on your phone, and you plug it in, your guaranteed to drain out the phone even faster!The claim that this phone can work 72 hours is almost laughable, and I would guess eventually legally actionable.  8-10 hours is a more realistic target.I can\'t stress the battery issue enough... this phone is NOT ready for prime time because of this.  The PIxel 8 should be considered as a hardware patch for this broken component, if they manage to fix it.Last bits of advice:The optical fingerprint sensor doesn\'t work.  It enrolls fingers most of the time... but then they won\'t match.  False-negative / FNIR is nearly 100%.  If you add a finger, you can re-enroll the same finger again and the system won\'t stop you... because it can\'t match the first enrollment encounter to the second... LOL....  Some people I know have enrolled the same finger 4 times (limit of android) just to make that finger a bit more matchable.  Apparently the Pixel 8 will have the Qualcomm piezoelectric scanner built in, which should be better... but the Pixel 7 fingerprint scanner is not usable.Face recognition is also beta-level software, and not well supported in the OS... so its nice to have... but high error rates, and mostly unsupported by various applications.  I can\'t estimate how bad FNIR is because its so poorly and inconsistently supported across the platform.My advice to Google:  when the pixel 8 is released, I suggest making it a free swap-upgrade for Pixel 7 owners as an apology ... and get the 7\'s back and move them in a nice landfill somewhere.  Google has been making phones for 14 years now... these rookie mistakes shouldn\'t be happening.', '1st new phone in a while so takes some getting used to. Nothing like my Samsung that I had for a number of years. Still learning. Having little trouble with silencing calls, so I miss calls sometimes. As I said, still learning.', ""After having used the Pixel 7 for a few weeks now, it hasn't met my expectations coming from a Pixel 3a. The Pixel 7 is my third Pixel device and seems to lack a lot from previous jumps and the competition. Moving from the OG Pixel to the Pixel 3a was amazing; the finger printer reader worked great, the battery life was awesome, and the device just worked for about 4 years! The 7 seems quite weak in comparison with this latest upgrade. The fingerprint reader only works about 50% of the time even with the sensitively changed to compensate for a screen protector, the battery life isn't great, and the camera, along with its features, leaves a lot to be desired when compared to something like an iPhone 14. I'll keep the 7 for a while, but if the Pixel line doesn't improve then I may have to look to an iPhone since the cost savings between the two devices doesn't seem worth it. It feels like I should have just spent a few more hundred bucks and moved to the better-equipped iPhone."", ""Update: 1/10/23 I have had this phone for a month and half now the phone is great especially after the December update still waiting on January update. Battery has gotten a lot better since  Ibought phone but the battery is not going be on par with the Pixel 7 pro or Galaxy S22 ultra those phones have bigger batteries. I come home from work after 8 hours with 40 to 55 percent with moderate use and when I go to bed im at 30 to 35 percent. If I use fanduel or apps that update live data battery drains faster that was also the case on my Galaxy S20. The fingerprint and face recognition have always worked even before December update even better than my S20. Only con if it is a con the phone is slow charging the phone but one could argue that by not fast charging the life of the battery will greatly increased due to less heat. I have not experience any heat issues unless I'm using high CPU apps and the phone does not get hot but warm nothing extreme. I will update in about 2 to 3 months for now my 5 star stands.Initial review I only had this phone for a few days but I really like it so far. I used galaxy S series since the S3 but rising price, the removal of MST, and micro SD card slot I couldn't justify the price I was paying Galaxy S phones. Boost mobile does not sell pixel so I wondered if I could use an unlock phone and with mixed info online I decided to take the chance. To activate phone you have to call so boost can register the phone on their network it won't work by online swap. The phone is still learning how to I use the phone for battery optimization,  but I am getting 12 hours with moderate use. I live in metro area and I am getting blazing fast speeds but when indoors speeds drops off but not enough where you can't use the phone unless you are in a dense structure with thick walls. Only issue I had and not due to the phone itself is moving my Samsung calendar to Google calendar but overall this is a great phone especially at the price point. I will update after I have had the phone for awhile."", 'Si buscas un equipo básico, este es ideal para ti.El equipo llegó con detalles estéticos (rayado) son embargo estaba sellado, atribuyó a qué fue en paquetería.', ""This is my first Pixel phone, and after nearly six months of use, I can say that I'm very happy with it. Great build quality, features, and performance. If you want flagship performance without paying flagship prices, this is the phone to get. If future Pixels are up to par with this one, I can see myself sticking with them for my upgrades going forward."", 'Llegó en buenas condiciones, sellado, sin problemas. Funciona de maravilla. Muy recomendado y más por las futuras actualizaciones de software que tendrá.']"

I just had to switch over my SIM card using the provided tool and wait a little bit for it to connect. It was exactly $300 USD when I purchased it, a great price for a great phone. (EDIT: I was worried about the phone not being compatible with the bands used by T-Mobile, but using the LTE Discovery app I have seen it connecting to LTE bands 66 and 2, despite them not being listed in the information here on Amazon. So, it seems to be compatible with more bands than the description says.)I got the blue version with 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, it\'s beautiful and a major improvement from my Moto G Fast which had 32GB and 3GB. The memory extension boosts the RAM to a whopping 16GB total, which is way more than my actual computer has, and it\'s amazing for multitasking, whether you\'re gaming while listening to music and responding to texts or just switching between apps a lot.One of the reasons I chose this phone was for the fingerprint scanner. Although the side-mounted location isn\'t as convenient as the rear-mounted one on my Motorola, I\'m getting used to it. It also seems less reliable than the Moto\'s scanner, if my finger is a little sweaty or I hold it at the wrong angle, it\'s likely to not recognize it, but when it does work, it\'s super fast. The Motorola always had a delay of a second or two between me pressing the scanner and the phone actually unlocking, but with this it feels like I\'ve barely tapped it and it\'s instantly unlocked.When I excitedly opened the Amazon box, the phone box was in there. It didn\'t have any packaging around it, like those plastic bubbles or anything, but nothing was broken, so I guess it was fine that they did it this way.A nice clear case was included, I\'ll have to buy a screen protector separately though. (EDIT: after looking more closely I think it did actually come with a screen protector, I just didn\'t notice before because it was already installed on the screen. I\'ll probably still buy my own to replace it though, to get better protection.) Although it came with an extremely fast 67W charger that is compatible with American power outlets, I did not find the advertised 55W car charger anywhere in the box, so if you\'re expecting one of those, you\'ll be disappointed. Thankfully I don\'t have a car so I didn\'t actually need that.I\'ve already talked about how great the hardware is, now for the software. This is my first time using MIUI, and overall I like it, although there are some quirks. It came with a bunch of pre-installed apps, including Facebook, AliExpress, some kind of car rental service, and several games. Thankfully this bloatware was easily uninstalled, but honestly this phone has so much storage capacity I probably could\'ve left them all on there without worrying about them taking up valuable space. Some of MIUI\'s apps do have ads in them, but they aren\'t too annoying, and I don\'t find it necessary to use those apps anyway. (EDIT: if you dig around in the settings for those apps you can find an option to turn off ads, if they really bother you)The biggest annoyance I\'ve discovered is trying to use widgets. If you tap and hold on the home screen, it\'ll let you edit the layout, and there\'s a button that says ""Widgets"". You\'d expect this to show all the widgets provided by your apps, but no. It shows some weird MIUI widgets that don\'t look useful at all. You have to scroll down to a section called ""apps with multiple widgets"", tap ""all"", then tap the subtle button at the bottom that says ""Android widgets"". Now you\'ve finally got access to all your beloved widgets. And yes, you have to go through this whole process every time you add one to the home screen. I attached screenshots showing each step of this process but Amazon put them in a random order so it\'s confusing, I\'m sorry about that.', 'Una vez  probado  el mismo,  la batería  va a durar dos días a pesar de un uso  excesivo de la pantalla para poner aplicaciones del anterior terminal,  trae muchas aplicaciones que no uso  y molestan bastante  las de inducción a compras,  La huella  en el margen  no me gusta, funciona  para  encender pero no me  lo admite  para entrar en  mi banco online  lo que es un trastorno,  tiene una buena cámara de fotos pero otro Redmi de mi hijo, más barato tiene lo opción  macro y  en este no lo encuentro, parece que no tiene,  en la caja viene el teléfono  un cargador rápido , una funda y un protector  para los cantos del  terminal,  este último no lo uso porque adquirir  otro ,  en general  es un buen terminal  espero que las especificaciones de seguridad contra agua etc  sean correctas, es algo que el tiempo determinará.', ""The phone has excellent speed for the it's mid range price.Majority of the time you are running 120hzSome apps (anything with camera) will drop to 60hzNot the best camera out there.

In most of those reviews, what is missing is the degradation over the years.I consider myself a moderate user using the phone probably once every 1-2 hours for messaging and sometimes the camera every 6-12 hours or none at all.After using the phone for 1 year, the battery life can barely go through 3/4 day without having at least a charge. In the 2nd year, you are probably looking at a full-charge in at least half a day.  This kind of battery life degradation is almost similar to the cheap Chinese phones like Xiaomi. Now, the good thing about this phone is that battery life does not affect the performance (I'm referring to the Nexus, Xiaomi and the older Samsung phones). However, in this modern day and age, you don't just get a cheap battery and slot it into your flagship model and expect users to get it replaced at their service center for a cost. After being a Google phone user for 5 years, I think it's time for me to switch to Samsung. Even through their UI/UX isn't as good as Pixel, at least they don't use cheap hardware.Nearly 2 years later, my Pixel 4's battery is swelling and I'm being quoted S$88 to get it replaced."", 'Have been using Android over 10 years and carrying Pixels the last 4 years. Love stock Android. I don\'t usually buy phones at launch, but I caved this year. Don\'t care about the camera, but if this is important for you, look no further. Like it\'s predecessors, this phone takes nice photos. Cool design, premium feel, and a modestly updated feature set. Android is still Android after all. The phone does feel good in your hand. Screen is very nice and the 90hz refresh is noticeably smooth. If you\'ve been reading reviews, you\'ve probably read all this elsewhere.I do want to like this phone and am going to give it a chance, but I\'m going to be merciless if the device doesn\'t stand up to reasonable everyday use. What do I mean by this? We bought two phones but I\'ve only opened one of them to evaluate. Set up was easy. Connect your devices and less than 10 min later, everything was transferred. Apps installed, then they updated. Ready for testing. WiFi and Bluetooth connection were fast and solid.One thing I was quite impressed with was the sound. After using earlier pixels with front firing speakers I was a little worried. Nothing to worry about here. Sound quality is very good (full and rich), and the gesture navigation skip forward and back worked for me as well, boom!  4K videos looked good and so did ones shot in 1080p.Face unlock. This was another ""on the fence"" item for me. Cool feature and it works, but now they have it all. Our fingerprints from the last generation of phones can now be linked with our faces. Works perfectly in pitch black darkness.  Infrared wins.I still have the same (major) concerns as others. The 2800mah battery is tiny. I am extremely skeptical here, but hope I can be proven wrong. No unlimited original res photo storage. I know Google is in business to make money, but what a chump thing to do. It\'s right up there with them not including a headphone adapter or headphones this time around. So this is the price you pay or accessories you forego to have the latest tech. I believe this could have been done better or differently. It\'s a flagship phone, or at least that\'s what Google is calling it. Congrats Google, you\'ve cut just about every corner you possibly could with this device.What\'s next. Let\'s see how the device performs in real day-to-day usage. In the car, in a pocket with Bluetooth and the normal stuff we all do with our devices. The TINY subpar battery had better be good. Otherwise 2 of these phones are coming right back to you.My suggestion, if you didn\'t jump on the launch deal is WAIT. The phone is nice, but the potential for disappointment is there. Black Friday and Christmas are just around the corner too.***Update Daily useCall and audio quality is good, using a BT headset also good. Streaming music to the cars audio system working well. Android 10 has a few quirks, but is working and very stable.  I haven\'t had any performance issues with the device or its OS.  Although I had WiFi calling on my 3XL (AT&T) , it will not activate on this device. May I have to call them to see why.***Update after 3 weeks of ownershipWhile I am fully sold on the Face Unlock feature, I still miss the finger print reader.  Its just something you become used to after years of pixel ownership.  I\'ve only caught myself trying to unlock the phone about 3 times with my finger.  I set up face unlock without glasses, but it works when I put on reading glasses, and also while wearing sun glasses (that one is amazing).  One thing people and (google) haven\'t thought of.  Currently, Face Unlock works even your eyes are closed.  Google has said they are going to release an update that addresses this.  Ok, so what happens when I\'m wearing sunglasses?Trusted Devices or Places will probably address this.  My phone stays unlocked in the car and at home or work.  But if you are outside walking around and wearing sun glasses, you might have to PIN into the device or lift your sunglasses.  This is still an unknown I guess.I called AT&T and we determined the IMEI of the phone was not ""whitelisted"" on their network.  Hence the reason why I couldn\'t activate Wi-Fi calling.  It took them 3 days, but they re-provisioned the SIM (remotely) and added the ID.  Wi-Fi Calling works now.  If you have this problem with a new phone (any brand) that is compatible with voLTE and Wi-Fi calling, but was not purchased through your carrier (subsidy) there is always a possibility that the phone will not be ""whitelisted"".  You have to call customer care and be really nice.  I got lucky the first time I called, sometimes it takes more than one call.  The second device (other P4) which is also with AT&T (but a different plan) will not allow Wi-Fi to be activated either, so this means another call to the carrier.  Hand off between Cellular and Wi-Fi or vice versa works 98% of the time.  I\'ve had a few dropped calls say when I\'m walking into work or the house and the phone transitions from Cellular to Wi-Fi.  Mostly however, it works and is stable.  For those who have had Google Fi, you\'ll know exactly what I am talking about.  Wi-Fi calling capable devices attempt to switch aggressively whenever they can move voice calls to Wi-Fi.The new Google Assistant is very good.  The AI they have built into the core of the OS is impressive.  Not needing a cellular or Wi-Fi connection to use it makes it extremely fast.  For me, this is probably the most notable upgrade from a Android/hardware perspective.BIGGEST concern >> the 2800mah battery.  Remarkably, the phone lasts all day and well into the next morning without being charged.  I had concerns about going to sleep with a low battery and having the phone die during the night and then no alarm in the morning.  Well, it hasn\'t been a problem.  I typically have 17-30% percent remaining in the morning and can easily throw the phone on charge before leaving the house.  I have the ""always on"" display turned on, and allow all notifications to display on my lock screen.  I have gesture navigation enabled which keeps the soli radar chip active and looking for gestures above the device when its stationary.  I stream videos and play music over Bluetooth in the car.  I also use navigation when walking frequently.  Normal use and the battery has held up well.  This is really a matter of personal preference and your usage.  Initial reviews said 3-4 hrs of screen time should be expected.  I\'m getting 5-6hrs.  If you are on your phone for hours a day, or play games, get the XL.In closing, I have found myself >>inconvenienced<< more than once since the phone did not come with a USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adapter.  I have headphones, but have been left to work one handed because I don\'t have my BT headset with me.  Google > BIGGEST CHUMP MOVE EVER.  Really pissed me off.  I\'ve ordered one.  Tired of the inconvenience.With that said, my original recommendation stands.  If you cannot buy the P4 or XL at a serious discount, WAIT.  It is not worth the full retail price, regardless of the new ""features"".  Its over priced for what you get, and Google has cut way too many corners seriously detracting from the value you receive vs. cost of the device at full price.  Still 64GB of storage, small 2800mah battery, no adapters, no headphones, no unlimited full res photo storage..  Other people have said this too.  Google has had several chances to build and release good devices.  They just can\'t get it right.  You pay for a flagship and there is always a compromise.  In the case of the P4, its one after another.***Final Update 6 weeks of ownership.I am enjoying the phone and it\'s working as I intended.  I had Android 10 on my 3XL so no surprises there.  As usual Google continues to improve and refine it\'s OS.  Everything just works.  This is why I buy Pixels.While I like the phone, this years Pixels did not wow me like those of previous years.  It\'s a phone, it\'s running the latest version of Android but that\'s about it.The new AI built into the Google Assistant remains the most noteable ""feature"" from an upgrade perspective for me. But like before, that\'s it.  The premium price tag is just disproportional to the value you are receiving.I am a fan of Android, but this year Apple and OnePlus nailed it from a hardware perspective.  Cost to value ratio.  They came through where you (Google) failed. The P4 isn\'t even 2 months old and most carriers are practically giving them away.  Not to mention Google has substantially increased trade in values for older devices to entice new buyers.Which leads me to ask..  Google are you giving up on Pixel?  Does this mean Samsung and OnePlus devices for everyone next year.  Man you guys got some black eyes this year.  All avoidable too.I can say this.  Nice phone, but I won\'t buy your device at launch next year.  Everyone, I urge you to heed these words.  Do not pay full price for this device.  I\'m not saying don\'t buy it, but don\'t buy it at full price.', 'I only put a five-star rating on this so it would be at the top of the list and people would see it. I spend a lot of time writing reviews for products and places and I think this review will be beneficial for you if you are planning on buying this phone.The first issue is with the third party selling system. When I received this phone it was very clear to me that this was not a new phone as it had a Verizon wireless SIM card in it. Clearly this is false advertisement.The second issue I had with this experience is that the phone did not operate properly. When I plug the phone in it overheated. When I turn the phone on and try to use it the screen glitched.The last and probably most important issue I had with this process and experience is the unprofessionalism of the seller. I requested a return for the item prior to its return date expiring because I had so many issues of the phone. The request for a refund was authorized by the seller but three days after the phone arrived at the seller I still had not had any confirmation or communication of my refund status. I called the store several times leaving voicemails and still have not received any feedback or communication from the seller themselves. I read other reviews on this phone that talked about the third party not holding true to their system of refunds and I thought this was a joke, but sadly this is the truth.If you are thinking about purchasing this phone understand that you can only expect so much from third party individuals and that they are not held to the same standards as amazon.com. also note that when an item seems too good to be true for the price it usually is. I was looking for a phone to replace my Google 3A which I have reverted back to because it works better and is more functional than the ""brand new"" phone that I paid for from the third party company. Understand that you will possibly incur some headaches and stresses from trying to get this process and phone probably working for you. I would not recommend this phone or this third party seller to anybody else. I am sure they are decent people but society in reality have taught me that you can trust everybody and this is how I feel about them thank you.', 'When the new Pixel 4 was released I took a look at my two-year-old Pixel 2 and wondered if I really needed to upgrade, given what a great phone it had been, and still is. Giving in to a bit of retail therapy is easy, so I did.It\'s an expensive business getting a Pixel phone in this country (New Zealand) since it\'s a buy from Amazon in the US, shipping to the other end of the world, paying GST (our sales tax) converted to NZ dollars added up to $1,550.Was it worth it? Let\'s take a look.** Edit: After nearly a year, I just love this phone, absolutely rock-solid even with over a hundred apps installed, I\'m revising from 4 to 5 stars **I\'ve owned a lot of android phones and had the Pixel 4 for a few months now and it\'s performed pretty much flawlessly, both the software and the hardware - as I expected it would. I really like Google\'s own implementation of their Android O/S - it\'s clean and just works. There are some UI annoyances that I\'ll come to later. Other makes (Huawei, Samsung) all seem to be clogged up with unnecessary and buggy extra apps and take years to get Android updates through. I get Google\'s updates within days of release and I\'ve never had a bad one.In their attempt to regain a handful of pixels from the bottom of the screen, Google have removed the Home and Back on-screen buttons and replaced them with gestures. This has or will probably occur on other makes of phone as Android 10 rolls out. The new gesture needs a swipe from the bottom edge (home) or from either side (back), and I pretty much hate it. ** Edit: You can turn that off and now I like it **If you miss the edge (it\'s tricky if you have a case with a raised edge) then you end up swiping the app off to somewhere unwanted. If you get a bit close to the edge when you\'re scrolling within an app, you suddenly go home or back. It doesn\'t happen to me very often but when it does happen it\'s infuriating. Hint: When buying a case, look for one with a low profile on the screen side - though that won\'t protect the screen quite as well.As for other features, I\'m not so sure there\'s a lot to say. The main one is the face recognition lock which I\'ve turned on and also the ""Keep phone unlocked while I\'m looking at it"" option. I like that one, it saves the phone going black when I\'m taking my time reading, or something. It\'s also nice to just pick up the phone and look at it, it\'s so natural, quick and easy. People seem unduly worried about the security of this feature, I\'m not sure why except maybe for the unlock while you\'re asleep. If someone is in a position to do that, then they are also in a position to do many awful things to me and additionally, the banking and other vulnerable stuff on my phone has a further level of security.The screen is up to par, and the glass is nice not picking up oily finger goop like all my others did after a while. I\'ve given up on screen protectors, my phones are pretty safe being mostly in my pocket, and I like the feel of the screen. Feels like a solid build to me without being too heavy, though it\'s heavier than the Pixel 2 and has quite a bit more screen, mostly in the length.People seem to rave about the camera and I agree it\'s good, but so was the Pixel 2 so the step up doesn\'t seem huge to me - but then I\'m no camera buff. The Pixel 2 was a bit better at close-ups which I do a lot of when working with electronics. The Pixel 4 can be zoomed up to 8x but can\'t focus closer than about 120mm which limits its use as a macro camera. The P2 was good down to about 60mm. (4.7"" and 2.4"")Sound is surprisingly good watching a video. There\'s nothing at the bass end but that\'s to be expected in such a small body. The volume is good and the sound spread is wide though perhaps a bit overdone. I\'m not in a cathedral. I regularly use speakerphone and also Sennheiser Bluetooth headphones, and they perform very well on both phone calls and music. Bluetooth, WiFi, and 4G connectivity all seem solid.Battery life is marginal, my only real complaint about the hardware. An overnight charge to 100% would all be gone by 7pm if I wasn\'t quite careful. To counter this I bought a charger for the car so I can give it a commute-time top-up and things are better now. Wireless charging is cool and Qi chargers all seem to work fine. Makes charging in the car a breeze with a charger built into the holder. Wireless charging is not fast, about 0.9 amps, compared to a fast charger which charges at nearly 3 amps (~1 hr full charge time) but it turns the phone into a hotplate and could affect battery life.I recently bought a Samsung Galaxy Active 2 Smartwatch (SM-R810) and paired it up easily with the Pixel via Bluetooth, but with a fair amount of convoluted messing about with the Samsung apps got it all working reasonably well though it\'s a bit crazy and somewhat buggy. I sure wish Samsung would produce practical software like Google does. I did a review on the watch too.So was it worth it? Probably not, but mostly because my old Pixel 2 was such a nice reliable workhorse that has never slowed down even with 150 or so apps. Every other phone I ever owned has slowly ground to a standstill. I use quite a lot of apps.Am I glad I bought it? For sure, but I just can\'t part with the Pixel 2 so now that one\'s a spare.', ""I was upgrading from the Pixel 3aXL which was a good phone.  But the 4XL has a much better display and the screen looks a lot better. The face unlock is also very good.  I've had great difficulty with face recognition with other phones, they don't read my face, or I have to do it 2-3 times before it will unlock.  The Pixel 4XL will read your face each and every time.  I like the option of picking up the phone and two taps wakes it up, one look and face ID opens right up. There are also a ton of other features on this phone that I'm still learning about, quick gestures, call screen, active edge, Turn on Flip to Shhh, and more.  I like what I see so far!  A lot has been said of this phone and it's terrible battery life.  But the true reality is the battery is almost exactly the same as the 3aXL, and with extensive use it only lasts one day.  But I found a way to make it better, I set the refresh rate to stay at 60 HZ, honestly for my use I can't tell the difference.  PLUS, I set the display settings to adaptive brightness.  Now the battery is VERY good, it easily gets me through the whole day with battery left over.  Running at only 60 HZ and modifying the brightness, it saves tons of battery life.  The photos are just like the Pixel 3, awesome photos.  The video is adequate and the nite site gives very good photos in dark environments.  The camera is one of the best features although it still doesn't beat newer Samsung phones, it does take crisp clear photos.  For basic everyday photos, the software makes them the best at this resolution.  The processing is more than fast enough for everything I do and the stereo speakers sound very good.  I also like the fact that it gives you the option of three button navigation instead of phone swipe which I hear the future Pixels it's the ONLY way to navigate.  There are unique features to Pixel that use your Google account that you can't do on other android phones.  Some of my apps (not financial ones) auto save my password and log in so I can sign in at the touch of a button.  Other phones I fumble and bumble with long complicated passwords with everything.  So what's bad about the Pixel 4, something I haven't heard mention much.  In low light situations when using the camerea the display will sometimes have waves going through it.  My old Pixel 3aXL would simply fade a little (or brighten and fade) in this situation but the 4XL will actually have wavy lines go from side to side.  It's not a defect, I confirmed this by testing another exact model.  Using Messenger on video proved impossible because my image would have waves going up and down the screen like crazy.  Only going into a better lighting condition would help this (not worth the trouble).  Battery life is certainly not even close to newer Samsung or iPhone or any phones with the bigger 5,000 mah battery.  But so far I haven't owned a Google Pixel that has great better life yet (2XL, 3aXL, and now 4XL).  But with the settings I mentioned, I can live with just fine.  Also, no fingerprint reader, and no ultra wide camera.  But these don't upset me too much, my fingers do not seem to keep a proper unlock on any device I use.  Back to the good, this phone is very thin and light.  I use a Spigen Ultra thin case and this phone is much easier to hold, carry, and take photos than my Samsung S21 Plus (which beats Pixel in several categories otherwise). But we're comparing mid range to flagship.  But sometimes I like a smaller lighter phone especially to take photos at work and on the road.  If you can pick this up for $300 or less, it's a great deal.  I got mine new, for once I splurged and  skipped buying the refurbished model."", 'Tutto ok. Grande qualità', ""Professional reviews for phones are usually the best resource. However, that said, I think I should offer another perspective that isn't nearly as negative. In general, I think the reviewers were too harsh. Some of them even had me on the brink of canceling my order. Glad I didn't.I have the 64GB XL.Battery life - I am not seeing much difference from my Pixel 3. The horrible battery life mentioned in some reviews is not my experience. I consider myself an average smartphone user. I'm not a 16 year old on social media all day and I don't play games. I use it all day at work (email, text, in car for music, reading some blogs with videos, the occasional call) and a little at night. When I get home, I have over 50% left. I keep the always-on display on, I use motion sense, all the connection methods are on. The key here is that I don't see a big difference from my past phones.Also - you have to give the Android OS time to use its adaptive battery function to manage various aspects of the phone. It learns your usage patterns and adjusts. This results in better battery life. I saw many reviews where the author didn't give it time.HD Calling on AT&T - I bought this unlocked model on Amazon and when I swapped my SIM out, HD calling works normally. There might be an issue with corporate accounts but search the web and look at what some people did to circumvent it. This is an AT&T issue, not Google's.Motion Sense - no, it doesn't have a lot of active functionality yet, only track skipping and alarm snoozing (which is AWESOME). What many reviews fail to highlight enough is that it augments the face unlock feature by bringing your phone to attention when you reach for it. It also allows you to turn off the always-on display then have it wake only when you are near the phone.New assistant - pretty cool. Many of the basic requests are now handled on the phone, not requiring contact with Google servers. It really speeds things up.As of Nov 1, it does have little things that I hope Google works out. Face Unlock needs to be updated to prevent unlocks when your eyes are closed. It would be nice if Smooth Display (90Hz) worked more often - although, I think the display is awesome as is, it can only get better. Google is planning to fix those. More apps need to support face unlock and that's a total wildcard; depends on the app. LastPass supports it so that's sort of a gateway to your other apps.*UPDATE 11/19/19** Smooth Display (90Hz) has been corrected with the November security update. An already beautiful screen is even better now! Also - LastPass now supports Face Unlock.Finally, you can't deny this is an expensive phone. I got it for, basically, $100 off and that brought it closer to an acceptable price for me. But - it's a personal decision. You'll have to weigh the value and decide if it works for you.If you are considering this phone, I'll be honest, also consider the Pixel 3XL (or Pixel 3). Many of the new features on the 4 will make it to the 3. If you don't need to be on the cutting edge or the extra camera features, the 3/3XL is a great phone! However, you won't be disappointed by the 4XL. After a week of getting used to face unlock and the gestures, I really like this phone.NOTE ON MEMORY - My last two phones were 64GB. Prior to that, I bought 128GB. With my past two phones, I never ran out of space with 64GB. I keep several large music playlists downloaded, I upload all my images to Google Photos and delete them from my phone.Photos: No case. In a cloth case, you can hide the color for the most part if you want."", ""I like the facial recognition works 90 percent of the time, but the battery dies very fast, no issues with the seller on there part just if you're a minor you will need a adult sign for the package""]"

Only drawback is the 2 pin plug Xiaomi is providing especially when we use 3 pin plugs here', 'Minha experiência de 10 dias de uso com o Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 128GB / 6GB RAM:Chegou rápido em cerca de 3 dias úteis.-Prós:*Tela: Excelente, os 120Hz trazem uma experiência visual fluida e agradável para filmes e fotos.*Câmera: Ótima, os 50MP captam ótimas fotos em ambientes com boa iluminação natural.*Processador: Ótimo, O Snapdragon 865 é um bom processador para esta faixa de preço, oferece um ótimo desempenho para apps populares do dia a dia, sem travamentos.*Games: Muito Bom, dos jogos que testei tive uma ótima experiência de fluidez e poucos travamentos, destaque para o Call of Duty mobile que possui uma excelente otimização para este aparelho. Rodei nestas configs no app Game Booster:  -FreeFire  60FPS [Ultra]  -eFootball 2023  60 FPS [High]  -Call of Duty: Mobile 60 FPS [High]  -PUBG  37 FPS [Low ]  -FIFA Mobile  30 FPS [Medium]  -Runescape 3  30~50 FPS[Low]  -Genshin Impact  25~30FPS [Low]  -Fornite  15~30FPS[Low]É importante ressaltar que este é um Smartphone de entrada e não voltado para gamers, então eventuais quedas de frames e leves travamentos são esperados em alguns jogos. Apesar disso o desempenho foi satisfatório em todos os jogos menos no modo Battle Royale do Fornite onde a queda de frames foi alta pois o jogo ainda não é otimizado para esse celular, porém em outros modos com mapas menores ele se mantém em 25~30FPS.*Bateria: Excelente, dura o dia todo, destaque para o carregador ultra-rápido de 33W que permite uma carga completa em apenas 1 hora.-Contras:*Bloatwares chineses: ele vem com alguns apps chineses pré instalados (AliExpress,Shopee, TikTok...) . Esses aplicativos podem solicitar permissões de acesso e exibir propagandas. Porém, é possível remover ou desativar eles.*Embora a tela seja de 120Hz, nem todos os apps suportam essa taxa de atualização. Isso inclui o aplicativo do YouTube, que tem uma restrição máxima de 60FPS 1080p, não permitindo resoluções maiores como 2k e 4k.*Não grava videos a 60FPS e não grava em 4K. A resolução máxima de gravação dele é 1080p 30fps. No entanto, oferece o modo de câmera lenta (slow motion) que grava videos a 960FPS 720p.*Lente Macro de apenas 2 MP. Além de pecar em fotos noturnas.Resumindo é um excelente Smartphone pela sua faixa de preço, recomendo pela qualidade de acabamento do aparelho e fluidez de uso. Ele já vem com uma capa de silicone e uma película de proteção na caixa.', 'Com a necessidade de comprar um celular custo benefício comecei pesquisando os modelos que mais vendem no mercado e me deparei com os líderes de sempre: Samsung, Motorola...Apple não é custo-benefício aqui no Brasil.Eu já tive smartphones dessas marcas supracitadas, mas nunca da Xiaomi.Por conseguinte, analisei vários vídeos e tinham varias opções (não cabem ser citadas agora) que entregavam uma boa qualidade de apenas algumas características, porém o conjunto completo deixava sempre a desejar.Partindo da premissa que eu saí de um celular no seguinte estado:-Marca: Samsung-Modelo: Gran prime-Ano de lançamento: 2015-Armazenamento: apenas 8gb de memória interna.Considerando também o valor do mercado atual dos Smartphones: CATASTRÓFICO.Associo que a escolha da marca condiz com o meu objetivo:- Precisava de uma boa tela ( essa tela é a melhor do mercado para esses celulares de entrada).- Tinha a necessidade de uma boa bateria ( essa faz jus à marca, sem contar com o carregamento ultra rápido que eles ainda oferecem).- Buscava uma boa câmera ( não tira as melhores fotos do mercado, mas nenhum dos celulares dessa categoria vem com as mesmas funções dos top de linha).- Visava um celular que não travasse ( esse tem 6gb de memória ram, roda até os jogos mais pesados da play story como: Call Of Duty, Genshin Impact, bem como já cheguei até a jogar um pouco de The Legend of Neverland, não roda com os gráficos no máximo sem leg, pois essa não é uma das propostas da faixa de preço desse aparelho, mas dá pra jogar todos os jogos tranquilamente em modo mais light).Portanto, a aquisição desse aparelho está suprindo minhas necessidades e veio melhor do que eu pensava.Já fiz até a aquisição de outro para uma amiga.Comprem sem medo e boa sorte com o produto.', 'Do vendedor:1º Entrega extremamente rápida, muito boa, produto excepcionalmente embalado, lacrado, sem ressalvas. Moro no Estado do Espírito Santo, comprei no sábado, recebi na terça via sedex (2 dias úteis);2º NF - Não recebi a NF do produto, vou entrar em contato para solicitar ao vendedor;Sobre o aparelho:1º Comprei da cor Grey Onyx o que eu imaginava ser uma mistura de preto com cintilante, mas na verdade o celular é azul escuro, não atrapalhou em nada mas é uma observação;2º Achei que a bateria da 1ª carga duraria mais... 60% da bateria se foi em 08 horas de uso contínuo (com pequenas pausas mas no geral usando muito);3º Vem capinha transparente linda com vedação na entrada C e já veio com a película instalada;4º Não vem fone de ouvido (padrão xiaomi);5º Carregador muito bom, lindo inclusive. A carga é super rápida, aparece na tela o andamento do carregamento;6º As câmeras: Frontal, bem básica mas nada que lhe faça passar vergonha, mas longe de fotos profissionais, câmera traseira muito boa, com muitos recursos que ainda tenho que aprender a usar;7º Os aplicativos pré instalados são chatinhos, pois alguns eu não consigo desinstalar e realmente não vão me servir pra nada;8º Controle Remoto? Sim, e já vem com um aplicativo para isso, você seleciona o aparelho e a marca e o app se configura para parear com o aparelho, muito legal, funcionou com o meu ventilador e com a tv;9º O volume e qualidade do som são bons;10º Desbloqueio com reconhecimento facial funciona muito bem;11º Não tem NFC o que significa que não dá pra comprar por aproximação por exemplo.', 'Ótimo celular para adquirir, pelo preço, ele entrega até mais, bateria duradoura, tela com uma boa qualidade, não tem muito para falar, vai suprir suas necessidades do dia a dia, chegou na cor certa, demorou 1 semaninha para chegar, comprei no dia 16 de Agosto, então já estou com ele faz um tempo, em questão de jogos, até dar para jogar alguns pesados, mas ele vai esquentar e é nessa hora que você faz uma pausa, mas não espere muito, ele recarrega muito rápido, ele com carga em 30%, leva menos de 25 minutos para tá completamente cheio novamente, não vou colocar imagens por preguiça da minha parte, mas a cor que escolhi, me agradou muito, achei lindo, diria que o único ponto negativo dele é não ter o 5G, mas até agora não me afetou, então se fosse para dar uma nota de 1 a 10, seria 9, estava quase esquecendo de falar da câmera, não sou muito de tirar fotos, então para mim tanto faz, ela é boa, mas não faz milagre, bom então é isso, compraria novamente, mas espero não precisar tão cedo kkkk (rindo de nervoso).', 'Il telefono arrivato completo di guscio e pellicola , compreso caricabatteria con spina italiana tutto perfetto grazie Amazon e consiglio questo venditore veramente professionale.', 'Eu amei esse celular, pelo preço ele é sensacional e dificilmente tu vai conseguir encontrar um igual pelo preço dele. O custo benefício é ótimo, mas vamos para alguns pontos:•Pontos positivos (para mim):-A entrega foi extremamente rápida, chegou dois dias antes do previsto e veio muito bem embalado.- O celular vem com uma capinha transparente, ela é bem útil para quem não tem uma capinha mais resistente ainda.- A interface dele é muito limpa e bonita-A laterna é bem forte, ilumina uma área bem grande como se fosse uma lanterna física de boa qualidade.-Ele é MUITO MUITO leve comparado aos outros Redmi notes da Xiaomi.-A duração de bateria é boa, dura tranquilo um dia inteiro usando redes sociais e jogando alguns joguinhos.-Já  vem com sistema de rastreamento de celular e ajuda anti furto, anti perda.•Pontos negativos (para mim):- O celular vem com uma quantidade muito grande de aplicativos já instalados, de jogos, redes sociais e apps de compra. Não é difícil desinstalar, mas é meio incômodo isso.-Isso é algo particular meu, mas eu não gostei mt da sensação de toque do botão de volume. Eu achei ele meio rígido, esperava que fosse mais suave, mas isso talvez com o tempo de uso deixe ele mais suave ao toque.-A câmera, como já disseram, não é lá grandes coisas. Tem outros celulares mais antigos da Xiaomi com uma capacidade de câmera melhor, mas isso não me incomoda muito pq não uso tanto. Dá para baixar o aplicativo Gcam, para quem desejar fotos melhores.-O som  do alto falante não é tão potente assim. Meu parceiro tem um Redmi note 9 e o som dele é m beeem mais alto. Porém, isso não é um problemas, é só uma pontuação.Resumindo: eu amei e compraria de novo se precisasse', 'Não sei se por esse preço tem um celular melhor, a tela é o principal na minha opinião, chega a ser bizarro um celular de entrega ter essa qualidade.Desempenho é ótimo, se for pra jogar jogos com gráficos no máximo, obviamente esse não é o celular certo, pra o dia dia ele se sai ótimo.Camera dele é boa, vai conseguir tirar muito boas fotos e boas gravações de vídeo.E o design dele eu não preciso falar, mas sim, é realmente bem bonito nas suas mãosE a bateria é ótima, eu tenho um uso moderado, e carrego só uma vez por dia.', 'O valor e mega satisfatório porem e incrível oque e oferecido nessa faixa de preço, eu nunca possui um Xiaomi, foi meu primeiro e fui logo apresentado a esse, pessoalmente não me atraiu pela câmera ou tela grande e bem fluida, ainda mais para mim que vejo filmes, a real paixão foi pelo processador que não brinca em serviço, gasta bateria sim, não dura tanto mas isso e obvio, em compensação carrega bem rápido de 0 a 100, com o carregador original, e quando submetido a tarefas não pesadas e frustrantes, a bateria dura o dia todo, eu recomendo a todos que querem sair da mediocridade de ter qual quer telefone ( tenha O telefone ) com custo beneficio.', 'O vendedor da CVS ELETRO cumpriu o prazo e o produto chegou em 4 ou 5 dias corridos. Quanto ao REDMI NOTE 12, se saiu melhor que meu POCO X3 NFC mesmo o POCO sendo quase um smart gamer, com processador melhor. Inclusive esquenta 4 graus a menos, rodando o mesmo jogo. Agora se vc é exigente para câmera, gravar vídeos, tirar fotos, vc pode ficar insatisfeito. Pra fotos e vídeos eu recomendaria os REDMI NOTE 12S... Ou o POCO F5.']"

Tra gli aspetti che più mi hanno colpito è stata la fotocamera di buona qualità e la batteria che dura ben oltre.un giorno. Arrivo a sera con 30% abbondante. È un telefono che se usato bene fa egregiamente il suo lavoro. Ottimo l'Audio stereo (siamo a livelli di Top di Gamma) e il processore che al momento sfrutta al meglio gli 8 GB installati senza usufruire degli alti 3 di supporto. Lo Snapdragon 8 gen 1 è un ottimo processore anche se usato intensamente (tipo qualche ora) tende a scaldare un po'. Non ho  trovato nessuna pecca in particolare se non il display arrotondato ai lati che mi invecchia un po' la percezione del device. Nella confezione è presente un caricabatterie da 65w (al momento mai usato, preferisco utilizzare quello da 15 per preservare la batteria) e una comodissima (lo è veramente) custodia trasparente che uso spesso per preservare il cellulare quando vado in bici. È uno di quei device dove si trovano gli accessori anche dal pakistano o indiano e questa è una comodità perché si trovano gli accessori anche a pochi euro e subito.Non è il cellulare che mi ha fatto dire WOW, ma in tutta sincerità ne ho apprezzato l'ergonomia in primis (per me fondamentale) e l'equilibrio generale del comparto  sia hardware che software. Le fotocamere sporgono un po' ma ci può stare, ha anche la ricarica wireless che sia un'auto che in studio risultano molto.comodi.

Il principale difetto però rimane il processore Snapdragon 8 gen 1 che purtroppo è rinomato per il suo essere poco efficiente.- bordi stondati, seppur molto belli da vedere sono poco pratico e rendono molto complicato il trovare pellicole di vetro da applicare allo schermo, quelle che si trovano su Amazon non sono mai perfette e non aderiscono in maniera corretta rendendo il touch meno sensitivo. Inoltre questo genere di pellicole costano di più delle classiche.- la fotocamera è buona ma ho notato che il mio Mi 10 fa foto migliori di questo mi 12, normalmente se acquisto un modello successivo (oltretutto di 2 generazioni) mi aspetto di avere miglioramenti non peggioramenti, soprattutto in un ambito molto importante come quello della fotocamera.- purtroppo anche essendo un top di gamma, come alcuni Xiaomi presenta microbug come as esempio mi usciva spesso la notifica di aggiornare il modulo bluetooth e anche dopo averlo fatto continuava a darmi lo stesso errore ogni volta, oppure a volte tirando giù la tendina delle notifiche si compenetrano le notifiche con lo sfondo sottostante della schermata su cui ero.Come conclusione, un buon telefono ma non lo acquisterei ai prezzi di un top di gamma, inoltre la batteria e la fotocamera sono punti imprescindibili per me in uno smartphone nel 2023 dunque non mi sento di consigliarlo.Se la recessione ti è stata utile ti chiedo di mettere un pollice in su 👍🏻 per aiutarmi a scriverne altre sempre migliori.

Premetto che non lo uso per giocare, ma solo per comunicare e navigare un po' su internet, ma se il mio vecchio Xiomi prima mi poteva durare due giorni dalla carica completa, con questo bisogna sempre tenere sotto controllo la batteria e magari girare con un carica batteria in borsa.Altro difetto è che alle volte tende a scaldarsi più del normale.Un'altra cosa che dispiace è che non supporta il 5G di Fastweb.Insomma, in linea di massima, con i suoi 256gb di memoria interna e la possibilità di mettere due sim, è un bel telefono, ma con questi difetti non posso dire che sia il top."", 'Wurde tatsächlich mehrfach angesprochen, mit welchem Gerät ich Fotos schieße.Diversen Samsung / Apple Geräten in Sachen Bildqualität überlegen.', 'Habe es vor ca. 7 Monaten gekauft und liebe es noch immer.Die Kamera begeistert mich, der Speicher ist groß und Fingerabdruckleser + Gesichtserkennung funktioniert auch sehr gut.Bin auch total von der Farbe begeistert. Dieses strahlende Hellblau ist wirklich wunderschön.Alle Gegenstände die ich besitze müssen außerdem sehr stabil sein (lasse öfter Dinge fallen und bin etwas tollpatschig). Das One Plus Nord 2 kann auch da mithalten. Ich habe zwar Schutzglas drauf, aber es hat schon Stürze aus bis zu 4m Höhe gut überstanden.', 'Ich habe nach einem Ersatz für mein fast 4 Jahre altes Mate 10 Pro gesucht.Mir war natürlich klar, dass aktuell fast alle Geräte besser sind als dieses.Ich habe mich daher im Mittelklasse Bereich umgesehen. Mehr als 400€ sollten es nicht werden.Auf eine gute Kamera wollte ich jedoch nicht verzichten, auch ausreichend Speicher sollte vorhanden sein.Da ich, wenn auch selten, auf dem Handy spiele, musste auch ein relativ guter Prozessor her.Da man das alles nicht für 400€ bekommt mussten abstriche gemacht werden. Ein Snapdragon 888 wirds nicht werden, das geht sich nicht aus.Ich hatte erst an das Xiaomi 11T gedacht, wegen der 108 MP Kamera, Mediatek Dimensity 1200 (ja, war früher schlimm, aber der Dimensity 1200 gibt ordentlich was her) und ausreichend RAM / ROM. Ich habe daher ewig nach Angeboten gesucht, und bin leider nicht an die 400€ gekommen - es war schlicht zu teuer.Nach weiterer Recherche bin ich dann auf das OnePlus Nord 2 gestoßen. Der verbaute Prozessor entspricht dem vom 11T, also dem Dimensity 1200-AI. Den Unterschied zwischen dem Dimensity 1200 und dem Dimensity 1200-AI kenne ich nicht, ist eventuell nur ein Namenszusatz bei dem OnePlus Modell.Die Kamera hat nur an die 50 MP, der verbaute Sensor der Hauptkamera ist jedoch ein sehr lichtstarker Sony-Sensor. Aufnahmen im dunklen sind mit diesem Sensor kein Problem. Er kann die Nacht zum Tag machen. Nach vergleichen und weiteren Videos habe ich bemerkt dass dieser Sensor bessere Fotos macht, als die 108 MP von Xiaomi.Die weiteren Kameras, wie die Ultra-Weitwinkel Kamera, sind vorhanden, aber das wars dann auch schon. Da ist wirklich nichts gut dran. Die Haupt-Kamera gleicht das aber mehr als aus.Als Speichervarianten gab es 8/128 GB, sowie 12/256 GB. Die 8/128 Variante liegt bei etwa 399€, also genau wonach ich gesucht hatte, die 12/256 Variante einiges darüber, deshalb schied die erst mal aus.Als ich mich dann zur Bestellung durchgerungen hatte, gab es die 12/256 Variante auf Einmal im Angebot, um 419€. Da kein SD-Karten Slot vorhanden ist, und mehr RAM nie verkehrt ist, habe ich dann die größere Variante bestellt, und wurde nicht enttäuscht.Ich habe das Handy zwar erst seit ein paar Tagen, die Fotos sind aber durchwegs sehr gut, der Fingerabdruck-Leser unterm Display funktioniert einwandfrei und sehr schnell, es ist eigentlich keine Bloatware installiert.Das Gerät ist genau wonach ich gesucht hatte, die 19€ Aufpreis zur 12/256 GB Variante waren auch zu verschmerzen.Es wurde auch ein Case mitgeliefert, musste also keines extra kaufen. Eine Displayschutzfolie war auch schon angebracht und ein Schnellladegerät auch dabei.Ich kann jetzt nicht sagen wie lange das Aufladen dauert, es geht jedenfalls so schnell dass ich nach kurzem Anstecken (gefühlt 15 min) immer auf 100% war. Also das tägliche über Nacht anstecken entfällt bei mir bei diesem Modell.--- Nachtrag - 7 Monate später ---Das Handy hat am Anfang super funktionert, bis auf ein Problem, dass oft keine Benachrichtigungen bei Mail-Eingängen bei Gmail angezeigt wurden. Ein Software Problem das sich nach einem Update im März oder so verflüchtigt hat.Wo wir bei den Updates sind: Es läuft noch immer auf Android 11, das versprochene Android 12 kam bis jetzt nicht an. In anderen Ländern schon verfügbar, wurde wegen Problemen aber öfter verschoben.Seit 2 Wochen ist das Gerät allerdings ein Desaster. Es sind drei Hauptprobleme aufgetaucht:- Der Helligkeitssensor funktioniert offenbar nicht. An der Sonne stellt er das Gerät so dunkel, dass man gar nichts mehr darauf erkennen kann.- Bis man nach Druck auf den Power-Button den Sperr-Screen sieht, dauert es 5 Sekunden. Keine gefühlten 5 Sekunden sondern echte... wenn man in der Zeit den Button nochmal drückt, ist das Display auch gleich wieder aus. Das ist mir oft passiert als die Probleme begonnen hatten. Power button drücken, es passiert nichts, man drückt ihn halt nochmal, Display ist wieder aus. Mittlerweile heißt es: drücken, warten, irgendwann kommt dann der Sperr-Screen.- Auto-Rotate blockiet oft. Man möchte z.B. ein Foto im Querformat machen, dreht das Handy quer, aber die Software bleibt im Hochformat. Button für auto-rotate im Menü deaktiviert, wieder aktiviert, hilft genau gar nicht. Es bleibt fix im Hochformat.Was ich herausfinden konnte ist, dass es sich um ein Software-Problem handeln muss, da - wenn ich das Handy neu starte, alles wieder perfekt für 2-3 Stunden funktioniert, bevor das gleiche Spiel von vorne beginnt.Von den Fotos die das Gerät macht, bin ich dennoch begeistert - sofern die Software denn funktioniert.Habe in einer anderen Rezension Probleme wegen HDR gelesen, und das mal selbst ausprobiert. Also kann es bestätigen... ob HDR jetzt an oder aus ist, man erkennt keinen Unterschied. Das hat selbst mein altes Mate 10 Pro viel besser hin bekommen.Nachdem schon ewig keine Updates mehr kommen (bis auf die Sicherheits-Updates), obwohl das Gerät doch relativ neu ist, befürchte ich dass sich die Situation auch in Zukunft nicht merklich ändern wird. Die versprochenen Updates kommen einfach nicht, deswegen rechne ich auch nicht damit dass meine Probleme durch Updates behoben werden.', 'Zu erst,die Technik ist gut. Geschwindigkeit, Speicher, Display (im Sonnenlicht nicht so gut) alles ok. Nach einem halben Jahr kam es zu einem loop. Gerät startete ständig neu. Zurücksetzen brachte Erfolg, ist bisher nicht wieder aufgetreten. Die Gesichts- und Fingersensoren funktionieren ohne Probleme. Der Klang ist mäßig.Trotzdem möchte ich kein rein chinesischen Anbieter mehr haben. Alle Mittelklasse Smartphones bekommen entweder sehr spät oder gar keine Updates bzw. Upgrades. Bei meinem Huawei gabs gar keins, bei diesem One Plus ist Androit 13 wohl auch nicht mehr vorgesehen. Bei meinem Samsung (untere Klasse) habe ich seit einem halben Jahr 13.Wer gerne etwas länger die Geräte nutzt, sollte sich überlegen ob ein Chinese für ihn in Frage kommt', ""Il telefono è arrivato in condizioni perfette. Appena ho aggiornato il dispositivo con le ultime patch e configurato li account ho subito iniziato a smanettarci ed è molto soddisfacente. L'unica pecca probabilmente è il fatto che si vede l'attaccatura del display e che ci possa finire della polvere (infatti usandolo da 2 mesi circa ci è finita). La cover all'interno è di buona qualità, essendo dell'originale casa produttrice, ho preferito prenderne un'altra sia per maggiore sicurezza, sia per cambiare la pellicola con cui è arrivato il dispositivo, molto poco oleofobica (un'aspirapolvere). Il sistema è molto reattivo e la fotocamera fa foto eccezionali, best buy sotto i 400 euro. Io ho preso la versione 12/256, poiché era in offerta a 350 al prime day. Non metto in dubbio che anche la 8/128 sia ottima. Buon telefono anche per videogiocare, riesce a sostenere tutti i giochi sulle 60-90 fps e il display di 90hz fa il suo lavoro. Tra questo e il Samsung a52s preferisco questo nonostante quello abbia un display da 120hz e uno snapdragon 888, poiché il OnePlus Nord 2 dura molto più come batteria e si ricarica più velocemente. Inoltre ha più memoria e ram ed è più reattivo."", ""Il telefono ha ottime prestazioni, sempre veloce, fluido ed ha un ottimo display. I contro sono che scalda parecchio usandolo per giocare o in modo intenso e in giornate calde. La batteria non sempre vi porta a fine giornata,la ricarica a 65W (rapidissima) non risolve del tutto il problema, essendo che non vi porterete sempre con voi l'ingombrante alimentatore per la warp charge (incluso nella confezione assieme ad una cover in silicone bella ma non molto funzionale dato che non protegge le fotocamere). Il telefono risulta abbastanza pesante in mano,avendo la scocca posteriore in vetro (inutile a mio avviso dato che ormai si mette sempre la cover al telefono e quindi risulta sempre nascosta). In conclusione: prestazioni top ma batteria e riscaldamento eccessivo. Inoltre il sensore di luminosità continua ad alzarla ed abbassarla in modo molesto,costringendomi a regolarla quasi sempre manualmente EDIT 03/2023: Dopo alcuni aggiornamenti il telefono si è trasformato, giocando non scalda più nemmeno minimamente e la batteria è aumentata sensibilmente di longevità nell'uso quotidiano, assolutamente un ottimo telefono dato che i piccoli problemi che aveva sono stati risolti in modo ottimale.""]"

But doesn't support Dolby atmos.fingerprint reader working fine. No notable issues after Android 13 (August) update.Solid camera. Pictures are a bit contrasty but with great detail. Takes time to accept this new look of pics from the camera after using Samsung Note for a long time. Nighshots are spectacular. Portraits are incredible. 4k 30fps videos across all cameras. Zoom is incredible and no competition in this budget. Even digital zoom of 20X is usable sometimes. Integration of google assistant is awesome. Top shot is an excellent feature in the camera. Photosphere, Action Pan and Long exposure modes are fun. Video stabilization features are also awesome. Camera also has option to store pics and videos in locked folder directly.No bloatware and appreciate the clean android user interface. Liked the widgets too. you are actually paying for the camera features. Special features like tap to activate any app, Live transcribe, Live translate are great. Live transcribe seems to be beta and suffers to transcribe when people from different countries are speaking at a time but still great. 4g works great with my airtel and jio sims. jio is an esim and it is easy to download an esim.Files app has a secure folder to store private files.Dislikes:Phone still warms up while using mobile data for long time outdoors like using maps, watching youtube.Stays cool when using Wifi. Prolonged camera operation also heats up the phone. But phone never hangs. Expecting an update from google to sort out this issues.The Pixel launcher doesn't support app categorization. You need to search the desired apps. You cannot hide apps with in built launcher. You need separate apps from play store to hide and secure.No dual apps feature.Google should provide these basic features.No pro mode for the camera to control shutter speed or ISO. You do get controls for exposure, brightness and color tones. No pro video too. Agreed the camera app is sufficient for all cases but still no choice for enthusiasts.Live transcribe doesn't support Indian languages.No dolby atmos either for the speakers or for headphones.Apart from the novelties provided by Google, i still feel Samsung makes the best android phones and Samsung S22 Plus is a great alternative to the Google Pixel 6 Pro. Though it is expensive (85K), it gets all basic features in built and gets Indian warranty. Similarly capable camera but a bit less battery.At 65K this phone is a beast and great value for money. You don't regret your decision of buying this phone."", 'Update 2022-12-02Went for Pixel 7 Pro because they offered hope and a good trade in.Physically, the 7 is more slippery and they moved the volume and power buttons just enough that the Pixel 6 case doesn\'t work. Finger print reader is the same meh. Camera might be slightly better. Curved screen edges are a bit less painful for viewing, but the long, narrow format still feels slightly off, never got used to it. One complaint is that my fat fingers encroach on the screen real estate. Bezels are useful. Connectivity with FitBit for notifications remains spotty on both the 6 and the 7 with two different FB models.  Verdict:  Don\'t bother. Update 2022-07-07The messaging app is a disaster trying to use RCS with other parties that don\'t have reliable RCS, it does not automatically drop back to SMS/MMS, so messages sit unsent and silent until you check on them. The 21st century doesn\'t work as well as they seem to expect.The latest fun is that on the charging stand and charger I have been using all along, it no longer charges. It vibrates indicating charging state, the charge indicator shows charging and it discharges over night, does not feel warm like it is burning battery. It will quick charge with a cable connected charger.Add in the ongoing bluetooth connectivity problems and whatever else I have complained about, this phone is an annoying POS.Every time I drop it, I hope the screen is broken so I can crapcan this inexcusable, expensive crap. Maybe if I remove the case...If only there were a decent, unmolested Android replacement available.Update 2022-04-14Had it a few weeks now. The camera is good, bluetooth headset doesn\'t usually connect or if it does, phone does not appropriately switch audio devices. The fingerprint sensor is often annoyingly slow when it works, I am still cursing the design choice to put it in the screen rather than somewhere that would have physical identification and be easy to use. Curved screen is a pointless gimmick that interferes with viewing and I suspect it is also the cause of swipe navigation  being a less than positive experience. The vibration notification seems to be variable, sometimes so subtle you can miss it, sometimes feels OK. I rely on my Fitbit for silent notifications, otherwise I often miss them. I boosted my rating to three stars, there are too many significant caveats with owning this flagship device to rate it higher IMHO.Update: Purchased another one after returning the first. The packaging of the second unit had very nice double security seals with a printed arrow on the tear tab, the first had a cheap adhesive circle that looks like it was applied haphazardly. So far, the finger print sensor is faster. Will update next week if things are working well or sooner if it looks like a repeat experience.I\'ve had the phone for less than five days total, it\'s on it\'s 6th spontaneous restart, currently running in Safe Mode because that is the recommended first step in diagnosis. Negative points for Safe Mode going into Airplane Mode after I had logged in and put the phone down. The restarts have been before and after the February update.Good things:  Battery life is pretty good IMHO, my dock came unplugged one day and I woke up to it having a 50% charge after 36 hours.Other good things: Migrating to the new phone was mostly seamless. Camera seems good, haven\'t really checked it out.Real problems: random little glitches in animations, it\'s kind of like working with Linux as a GUI desktop, it\'s just not quite ""there"" in the way Windows and Mac OS are. Attached is an image of a cute little persistent booger. Sometimes it switches the phone to BT unit when you pick up a call, sometimes it doesn\'t.Other negative observations that aren\'t problems: My first phone with a wrap-around screen. Complete waste of effort IMHO, serves no purpose other than making the usable screen narrower and distorting the text at the beginning and end of lines.  Too narrow/too long, it falls out of pockets that my old XL stayed in. Fingerprint sensor has been good at identifying me so far, but it\'s a bit slow, you have to consciously hold finger there for a second. I miss having a tactile identifier for it so I don\'t have to look at the phone before I unlock it.Update: Returning it. Randomly restarted in Safe Mode.  Random restarts are completely unacceptable, I am on-call 24/7 very often and having a phone sitting and waiting for you to log in before it runs messaging apps is unusable.', 'I got this phone yesterday, came from a pixel 3 and this one is probably a tiny bit faster but the biggest difference is picture quality, resolution and aesthetics so far.I do find the phone to be a bit too large to hold comfortably, and it\'s so smooth that I\'ve dropped it a few times already. I\'m waiting on a quad lock case so it\'s a bit easier to handle.As far as it being ""renewed"", I can\'t tell at all. I see no scratches or wear on the phone and it behaves as I expected a new phone to behave. We\'ll see how it does long term!Update: I\'ve been using it for about two weeks now and it\'s still functioning well. Battery life is good and the phone is quick. One thing I\'ve noticed is that the camera crashes sometimes when you\'re zooming in quickly and tap to focus directly after.', 'As a current-gen ""pro"" level phone, the Pixel 6 Pro leaves much to be desired.  If you don\'t absolutely need the best camera available today, I suggest the Pixel 6a as the best value in the current Pixel lineup.POSITIVES:  The physical design is aesthetically pleasing, with the clean camera bar in the back (as opposed to the weird asymmetrical multi-lens configurations on many phones today) and just enough ""Google"" look and feel to differentiate from the raft of other phones.  The Stormy Gray color is very nice (although once you have a case on it you barely notice the phone itself).  The OLED screen with the curved edges and almost invisible bevels is beautiful and elegant both to feel and see, and the 120Htz refresh rate is super smooth (when it works, also a complete battery hog).  As per usual for Pixels, the OS is pure Android and the user experience is superb (it ships with v12 but v13 installed almost immediately upon setup).  There are innumerable ways to customize the phone settings, so once you get it adjusted for your use and preferences, it is a very functional phone (subject to the items noted below).  The CAMERA is spectacular, with both wide-angle and telephoto capabilities; hands down, the best pictures I\'ve ever taken with a smartphone.  The Night Sight actually works for stars and other dimly lit landscapes, the Magic Eraser is super cool to remove unwanted objects, and the motion setting allows you to take some really excellent shots with blurred backgrounds.  All in all, the camera is top-notch with a huge range of capabilities and just takes your smartphone camera to an entirely new level.NEGATIVES:  #1 The in-screen fingerprint reader is basically junk, works less than 50% of the time, much less functional than previous Pixels with a dedicated reader on the back (which you can do without looking at the screen, unlike the Pixel 6).  #2 is battery life - I had to turn down the screen refresh rate, reduce the brightness, and turn off Bluetooth (more on that below) to get the battery to last a full day (like morning to evening, not even 24 hours).  #3 is Bluetooth - This device will not connect to numerous (albeit mostly older) BT devices, all of which worked on my all prior Pixels (now half my other hardware is no longer BT compatible with my new \'pro\' phone).  #4 (minor but weird) The phone is weirdly slippery to the touch (like it\'s covered in some PFAS anti-stick coating), and it literally slides off surfaces and out of pockets...not sure why that was considered necessary but it\'s just weird and unhelpful (a case addresses this).  #5 Google Assistant - I know the AI is supposed to be a huge deal (and I\'m sure technologically it is), but I basically turn off Assistant for several reasons: it seems to turn on all the time (even when you don\'t want it to), I don\'t want to talk to my phone much of the time (like anytime I\'m in public), and too often it\'s just not helpful, so it\'s mostly novelty for me but I don\'t rely on it for anything.Overall the camera is what sells this phone (noting Pixel fans will love the excellent pure Android experience and overall design of the phone).  Keep in mind the other Pixels have the same processing software and chip, so you get much of the same value with the 6 and 6a.  If you don\'t absolutely need the camera, look at the 6a as the better value.  I got this at a substantial discount when Google started marketing the 6a and hinting at the 7, otherwise I would have gone with the 6 or 6a.  I would switch back to my Pixel 3A XL, but I needed a different phone to switch carriers.  Already looking forward to trade-in for a Pixel 7.', ""I just used for 4 months ..I got problem in my screen and couldn't give anywhere ..There is no proper service centre in India.. But the quality of camera is just awesome ..can't beat it"", ""And guess what that is. If you didn't guess, read on...My last 4 phones were (2) Pixel 2 XLs and then (2) Pixel 3XLs. Loved them all. Would have kept the 3XLs but for the fact that one carrier is dumping a good deal of their LTE in favor of 5G, and it's the future, at least for now.Got a Pixel 6a, but returned it because the screen was too small for me and it turns out some of the 5G radio bands don't work on it. AND the fingerprint reader was pretty bad. So with the recent (temporary?) price drop, I'm onto the 6 Pro. I didn't expect the fingerprint sensor on the Pro to be any better and I'm right about that.So I simply can't believe how poor the fingerprint sensor is. Even before I installed a screen protector. Installed screen protector and changed the setting to make the touch screen more sensitive. Then I figured out that enrolling one finger from each hand TWICE made a big difference. Unfortunately it's index fingers, because the bleedin' phone doesn't like my thumbs at all. Yikes. I swear I still have my original thumbs.HOWEVER the rest of the phone gets top ratings here. I use Nova 7 Launcher, with 3-button navigation turned on (swipes for everything suck, just one guy's opinion). Definitely keeping this phone, and probably getting another.I am guessing that they will either come out with a Pixel 7 series with actual fingerprint sensors that WORK - OR - get face detection working properly and put it back into Android.One day later update: All of the above stands. I am getting to like this phone even more as I use it. The fingerprint sensor, however, remains a disgrace. It typically takes me 1-3 tries to unlock the phone. Used to be 1, and 2 at worst, from the back sensor on my XLs. Just had to replace the screen protector as the last one simply popped off the phone in a short drop (with case on). Had to try and re-register fingerprints and it went badly indeed. Fingerprint recognition is barely working so I have to try again. This part is just a hot mess.And just got off the phone with Google tech support about the fingerprint reader. They -helpfully- wanted me to factory-reset the phone -or- send it in for service. But because the issues are EXACTLY THE SAME as the 6a I'd tried out, I politely refused these, as I don't want to spend hours resetting MS authenticator settings and app passwords that didn't come back down from the cloud. And I was already well-aware that none of these things would do any good. The problem is with the device design and/or its firmware and not my particular phone."", ""Okay so i bought the Phone like June 28, it was running Android 12L around that time and Android 12 wasnt optimised for the Pixel series, so i didnt reviewed this phone here, I have a Pixel 6 Pro, GLU0G (non-mmWave varient)Pros:CameraPixel Phones are beast when it comes to the camera, Google actually does an amazing Job regarding the CameraStock Android!I prefer Stock Android (well, you may have different opinion on this, you may like a Company/OEM's Custom Skin, ie:OxygenOS,MIUI,OneUI or whatever)But i do prefer Stock android as this has no Bloatware like other OEMs/Custom Skins haveAnd this generally gets faster updates compared to other OEMsBattery Life:I dont have any issues with it, i typically get 7-8 hours of SOT (80-20) and i dont charge the Phone upto a 100% saving the battery health to be honest..Cons:Even with Android 13 (August Patch) i sometimes found the screen froze for a few seconds :(Heating issue when using Mobile dataI get it, this has a Exynos 2100, and Google Re-branded the SoC to Tensor as they have added there Majik Machine Learning and other stuffBut still wish they did something about the Heating issue tbh (hopefully they fix this when Pixel 7 series releases)DisplayThis tends to get scratches easily, idk why, but hey This has a 2k display and the colours are crispy :chefkiss:"", ""Performance phone is good nothing to talk about it its awesome!!

Unfortunately that means digging through bargain bin phones. As far as this one goes, its pretty good overall. My most recent budget phone before this was a Samsung Galaxy A03sPros:- Much, MUCH faster than the A03s in every possible way- Battery life almost as good as the A03s while still being way faster- Stylus works pretty well and is nice for precision use cases- Screen is real sharp and generally bright enough. 90hz is useless to me so I turn it to 60hz to save batteryOkay:- The camera is 12MP, not ""52"" or whatever they stamp on there. This reminds me of the old days of computer monitors where the size as marketed was edge to edge of the case instead of the screen itself. It has aggressive filtering applied to every photo no matter what settings you change. I am not trying to be a pro photographer with my phone so this doesnt bother me much but I wish they\'d just put a non-filtered 12MP camera instead of all this silly marketing ""AI"" mess.Cons:- The moto firmware is mediocre. The ""peek"" function would be better if it just showed the normal lockscreen but no, they had to go and make a less accessible, more annoying version. This makes their \'tap to wake\' function, that I normally love on phones, far less useful.', 'I\'ve been a Moto phone buyer for a while now. They usually have a good price/performance ratio, okay reliability, and low levels of bloat with a mostly stock Android experience. This phone does everything I need it to, and does it pretty quickly thanks to the 6GB RAM. The relatively large internal storage also means that I shouldn\'t really have to offload stuff, other than maybe photos/videos, to an SD card.All the basic features work pretty well. Good reception, decent speaker, fast GPS, etc. Very few real complaints with this phone. Battery life is just okay. I used to have an older G Power with a massive battery, with a very long battery life. This G Stylus still has good enough battery life, especially if you ""trim the fat"" a bit, app-wise, and listen to music more often than watching HD videos. Days where I spend a lot of time watching stuff often leave me with 10-20% battery by bed time.However, nothing really stands out as amazing about it. I\'ve never owned a flagship phone, so I don\'t know if there\'s some magical experience there, but this Moto phone is perfectly adequate for basically everything other than maybe extreme graphics applications/gaming. It\'s a great deal at under $200, in my opinion.Now if Moto/Lenovo would just make their phones easily serviceable, I\'d wholeheartedly recommend them. Planned obsolescence sucks. Just make the USB-C port and the battery replaceable and I\'d sing Moto\'s praises to the world.Did you know that officially the USB C port is actually rated for fewer insertions than Micro USB? Sure, that\'s partly a limitation of making it reversible (more pins in a similar form factor) but it also means, gee golly, our phones will break even faster. I wonder why the standard was adopted so quickly? It\'s too bad that phones are essentially expensive disposable toys these days.Basically, this Moto phone is me making the best of a bad situation.', ""Phone is great value! After years of putting up with Samsung phones I got fed up with the constant software upgrades, Samsung slyly adding unnecessary apps that I could not remove and constantly dealing with Bixby which I dispised! I'm  not a gamer but watch streaming videos and movies. Switching from Samsung to Moto has been great for me! Camera is OK. I've had better. It isn't the best for long distance shots. The way to get distance is to use the video, which has great zoom, but then it's a video and not a photo. Pros: long lasting battery, fast, clear streaming. Cons: stylus. Having a stylus makes the phone less sensitive to utilizing a finger to crop/paste and type.  If stylus dislodges the phone has a weird vibration.  If stylus is removed and not in use messages pop up on the screen. Again, after Samsung  I'm extremely happy with the phone and have purchasing a 2nd phone for a family member."", ""I like the phone. Although it doesn't support 5G, it's a very good phone for the price. Doesn't come with  much pre-installed crap. My only slight disappointment is with the battery life. It is advertised as 2-day battery life, but I don't think the battery can last for 2 days of moderate to heavy use. Mind you, I don't even play games or do a lot of battery-intensive stuff. My usage is pretty minimal (only a few phone calls and texts a day, sometimes Youtube, and sometimes mails/internet), and with that it does last for 2 days, but barely. I think the battery itself can last for a long time if the phone isn't being used much, but it seems like Nokia didn't do a very good job on the software side of things to save power when the phone is being used. Nevertheless, it's still a good phone for my needs."", ""It is good phone 6gb of ram and 128 of space there is nothing out there I can safely buy.The only think I can say is the refresh rate 90hz for certain application example browser feels sluggish and jittery.I thought was phone and return to get another but the sec phone was doing the exact same thingFor now I just use at 60 at full time even when seeing videos on YouTube sine goes only to 60 hz.Only use 90hz for game.Besides this device is very fast and very good.Some say got like my have other don't, I learn to manage at it is.Quality of pictures are pretty good, video as well for phone this money you can ask more.Again applications the device works perfectly except the 90 hz issue in browser is sluggish and jittery I am point again.Games playes really good do see drop frames I really think is CPU is slowing down the phoneWell I would recommend if was the forceful 60hz to see browsers flow correctly and smooth scrolling."", ""The Moto G Stylus is a very nice phone.I got it as a back up phone when my regular phone broke and I had no phone to switch to while it was repaired. My family usually keeps an old phone handy, but we had no extra phone this time. This phone could have been perfect to keep as our back-up.I was impressed with the construction and performance of the phone. (Right up there with our Pixel and Samsung phones.)Setting it up was simple and using it was no different than our other Androids.AND then... I took it out to the car. It does not play well with Android Auto. And Waze did not function well on it at all. (GPS worked intermittently; the pointer jumped around on the map.) But Maps had no issues, so it's not the phone's actual GPS that was a problem.In fairness, I did NOT try to troubleshoot or correct the problems.I never did contact Motorola or the app developers for help.If I didn't use Android Auto or Waze, this phone would have been perfect, even for my main phone.It is a very nice phone!"", 'My Moto Z4 was reaching the end of its useful life, mostly due to an ever shorter battery life.  I\'ve had this phone for nearly 4 years, and it replaced the original Moto Z.  As you might surmise, I like the Moto line of phones.My criteria for a new phone was simple:1. Must have +6GB RAM2. Must have +128GB of internal storage3. Must have micro SD storage capability4. Must have excellent battery capacity5. Must have earphone jack6. Must have a decent processor7. Must have Android no more than on version old.8. Must be OEM unlocked for the USA9. Must not require a second mortgage to purchase.10. Must be 5G capable.With the plethora of phones out on the market, you\'d think there would be countless options...but no, there aren\'t.  The one phone I kept coming back to during my months long research was the Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G.I finally pulled the trigger a week ago and, after seven days of real world use, I have to say that I am impressed and pleased.  The phone runs smoothly and performs all of the needed tasks I need throughout the day: email, texting web searches, phone calls and maybe some twittering along the way.I\'ve noticed only a few stutters along the way, when I\'ve had 20 web pages loaded in Chrome, for instance and constantly switching from one tab to another.  The processor on this phone is a Snapdragon 750G, which is very capable but, like any thing, if you overload it, it may show some slight stutter when scrolling, but it has been rare and not really an issue for me.Now...the battery.  Impressive!  I use the phone most heavily in the morning as I begin my day.  I\'m up at 7 a.m. and by noon I was at 78% capacity.  by the time I plugged in at around 9 p.m. I still had almost 50%.Now, if you\'re streaming youtube videos, etc., you can expect a more rapid drain, but the battery in this phone is as large as anything you\'ll find in any other phone on the market.The phone size is surprisingly sleek, with a screen almost a 1/2"" taller than my Moto Z4.  Android 12 presents a learning curve, having come from Android 10, but I\'m getting used to it and I\'m sure in another week or so it will be second nature.  Motorola keeps its Android branch as close to stock as you can get.  The Moto gestures are a huge benefit that I\'ve come to rely on over the years, so I\'m glad I found a phone in the Moto line.I was skeptical about the whole stylus feature and, to be honest, I\'ve not had the need to use it so far.  I\'ve played with it and it\'s easy and intuitive to use.  I can foresee a time when I\'ll need to write a quick note, and this is ultimately better than searching for a pen and scrap of paper that you might wind up losing.  It\'s totally unobtrusive, but it\'s there if you need it and easily accessible.  I view this as more of an added feature that I\'ll be happy to have when needed, but out of the way.I like this phone so much I\'m going to purchase another one for my wife. I\'ve tried it with both T-Mobile and Verizon sim cards and the phone is right at home with either service.Motorola has hit the nail on the head for performance, features, and affordability.  I hope Motorola continues developing and producing phones like this.  I\'ll remain a loyal customer if they do, and will recommend this particular phone for anyone asking ""What is the best, affordable phone on the market.""!', ""I've had this phone for about 8 months.  I wanted to use it for a while before writing a review.  It's my 1st unlocked phone and so far I'm pleased with it.  I use Verizon as my service provider.  My old Motorola Droid Maxx froze up after using it for over 5 years so had to replace. I'm one of those people who doesn't replace my phone every year I usually use it til either the software is no longer updated or it gives up the ghost.  In this case my droid maxx gave up the ghost.  I had already been considering replacing it but then the screen finally cracked and it froze up and nothing would unfreeze it not even the folks at Verizon could get it to work.I'm also a fan of Motorola phones so was looking to buy another Motorola phone.So I decided to try this Moto G Stylus 2021 based on the reviews and price that I found on Amazon.  So far I like most of the features and how it works.  However, there are a few things I don't like.  My old Motorola droid maxx used wireless charging which I loved as there was no need to replace the charging cable when it wore out or worry about the charge port going bad like with previous phones I've owned.The Moto G Stylus  does not have wireless charging which is one of two downsides, but so far the charging cable and charge port work fine so not a deal breaker.The 2nd downside is that the only way to cast from the phone to your tv is to use Chromecast.  I tried several cast apps from the Google store but none worked.  Miracast is not supported either.  I'm sure someone tech savvy and with enough HDMI and USB cables might find a way to cast to the tv without using Chromecast but I'm not that savvy and the Motorola website says to use Chromecast to cast with this phone, so I bit the bullet by taking the path of least resistance and spent $30 to buy Chromecast on Amazon.Also, when I received my phone I had a difficult time getting the sim card to activate the phone so I had to go to Verizon to have them figure it out. I spent over an hour at the store as they tried to activate my phone.  They finally figured out that because my old phone had frozen completely something happened that interfered with the new phone activation and the sim card. Anyway once they figured out what was going on they were able to get my new phone to work.  I'm sure most people won't have this issue if your old phone still works.I like the camera feature also as the picture is much better than the picture from my old phone.  In addition night time pictures or pictures taken in the dark turn out sharp and clear.  Definitely an improvement from the camera feature on my old phone.I also like the long battery life.  So far with normal use it will last about 2 days sometimes longer, but sometimes it only lasts about 24 hrs but I think it's due to certain apps or features that I use that use up more battery power vs just standard usage with using battery saver.So overall I'm happy with this phone.  It seems to be well synced with Google too, so it's easy to access anything on your Google account. It did take me a little bit to get used to it's features and functionality, but it does come with a Moto icon on my home screen that is a guide that's at your finger tips to help you figure out a function or feature.  After 8 months I'm still learning new stuff about this phone.""]"
B0BDSH8SF9,Google Pixel 7 Pro – Unlocked Android 5G Smartphone with 12 megapixel camera and 24-hour battery – Obsidian(128GB),Smartphones,"S$1,048.00",https://www.amazon.sg/Google-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-megapixel/dp/B0BDSH8SF9/ref=sr_1_25?qid=1695968220&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051%2Cp_72%3A6469119051%2Cp_36%3A20000-150000&rnid=6450031051&s=electronics&sr=1-25,https://www.amazon.sg/Google-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-megapixel/product-reviews/B0BDSH8SF9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,4.3,"['Like the camera, dislike the rest.. Well, owning this phone will be constant reminder for me for a whole year that overheat and lousy battery life exists in google flagship phone. I didnt have this problem with 5 years old phon. Just feel a bit of unlucky', ""Okay, so I decided to switch from iOS to android. I've had at least 4 iPhones leading up to this change, and I was getting tired of iOS as a whole. It was bland and less innovative, so I wanted a change. The Pixel was a great choice.Battery life: I have had no issues. My former iPhone would last maybe 4 hours and be at nearly 10% whereas the Pixel will be at around 60% doing the same basic tasks. It will last the whole day, but definitely gotta charge it when you're going to bedScreen: The screen is awesome. Nice and big, the quality is very good as well. You have the option to up the resolution to 1440p, but I didn't see a major difference, so I kept it at 1080p to save battery. I love the 120Hz tho. It's really smt that you don't know you're missing until you have it. I do have two issues; first being that the type of glass they use scratches fairly easily. I have two scratch marks I have no idea where from as I'm extremely cautious with the device, but the reasoning for this is that the type of Gorilla Glass is less prone to shattering. The second issue being the curved edges. It looks very cool. But in theory, I have accidental touches from time to time and they are impossible to find good screen protectors for.Biometrics: This phone has two biometrics, face unlock and fingerprint under the display. The fingerprint is fairly good, however it could be a little slow at times (nothing major, just a hiccup from time to time). Face unlock is great when you're in a well lit room, however absence of light makes it useless. The one negative thing I can say about biometrics is on Google's Wallet app. The app only requires the phone to be unlocked to use the added cards, unlike iOS, where you always have to scan for biometrics or type the passcode to authorize the payment (which feels more secure in my opinion)Charging: This is one of the weak spots of the phone. It takes approximately 2hrs to fully charge the device from near empty with fast charging via USB-C. It's simply not as fast as other companies, but it does the job. They also have adaptive charging, but it only works for me when an alarm is set. Also, wireless charging... Not worth it unless you purchase the overpriced pixel stand. It just takes too long at the throttled charging speedCamera: Excellent. Not surprised considering the Pixel has a reputation of being among the best in the smartphone industry. Pictures are crisp and well-detailed. Love the colours as they are not over contrasted like a Samsung, and the phone takes decent night time shots as well. The ultra-wide isn't as wide as the iPhone though, but still good nonethelessMiscellaneous: There have been a few hiccups along the road. In the first few weeks, there was a bug on the phone with phone calls. After approximately 3 minutes, the calls would drop, but in the last few weeks, that problem seem non-existent. I had issues with Bluetooth headphones as the phone stops them from reaching their full sound potential (you have to disable absolute volume in developer options to fix it). There have been 2 instances where the phone got very glitchy out of nowhere (a quick restart fixed it tho). Lastly, android as a whole is amazing, but it has some weaknesses, such as optimization. Many apps show the menu bar and bottom bar blacked out, which looks weird aesthetically. Some apps work but miss features (i.e Snapchat has no dark mode). These are the developers' fault, but it still is a weakness of the phone (and Android's large phone pool) overall. On the flipside, I will say that google impressed me with their messages app. The app allows users to connect on other devices (including apple devices) to view and send their SMS messages, which is great! And I also wanted to say that the swipe back feature is awesome (reminiscent of iOS; however no swipe forward) and the Pixel launcher is stellar. The only downfall of Pixel launcher is the lack of support for other icon packs, but you can get a new launcher for thatOverall, there are several small issues that are very manageable. The others have been fixed over time through updates or workarounds. The phone is a very good value for the money, especially with the Black Friday discount I got it on. It does everything you want a phone to do and at a good cost. It also feels like it will last a solid two years without a doubt, so I'm happy with itUPDATE: the pixel after around 4 months had a display issue that is supposedly common. It began flashing green on the AOD, which was a real headache. The phone would flash and go black and unresponsive until you rebooted the phone with the side buttons. It was only an issue when the phone ran hot, which was often enough. Temporary fix was to turn off the AOD, but it was still a bit noticeable when turning the screen on. The phone as mentioned also ran hot, like really hot, but it never gave me a warning. I contacted Google, and they had it repaired by a company for free under warranty. I brought it in, and they replaced the motherboard and screen. Afterward, the phone has had no issues at all! I also was able to get a screen protector for the new glass. One thing I did notice was that one day the phone got a bit warm like it did before, but it actually gave me a warning, which shows how messed up it was before. Anyways, problem has been fixed for a month, and I'm happy with it... Just beware it can happen if you want to buy one"", 'Es un excelente equipo, con un desempeño más que suficiente para cualquier tarea demandante.Les mejores fotografías, principalmente por todos los detalles que pueden capturar. El sistema operativo es limpio sin bloatware y extremadamente eficiente.Solo le duele un poco la duración de la batería, lo vas a tener que cargar cada noche con un uso de pantalla encendida de 6 horas', 'Before ordering, I searched the product page everywhere for the words ""used"", ""renewed"", etc: anything to indicate that I was not going to receive a brand new Google Pixel 7 pro. Not having found anything to that effect and given the fact that they offered free returns, I took a chance that, perhaps this was my lucky night so I ordered a pair: one for me and another one for my wife.Unfortunately, what I received was obviously a previously used product, as it arrived not in original packaging and not with original chargers, etc. (See picture). So, I decided Not to actually open the box and pull out the cellphone. The concern that I have w/ purchasing a refurbished product is that it voids several additional coverages and potentially (as per Amazon\'s post on its own ""Renewed"" product) nullifies the waterproof rating. Given that we plan / hope to keep these phones for several years, the price difference between the used and new becomes less of a concern, and the additional free warranty from our credit card on a brand new product becomes a greater and more important value.i should add that each phone came with a very nice Anker PowerPort PD Nano (perfect) capable of outputting (see picture):5V @ 3A or 9V @ 2.22ASo they sent really high quality items and didn\'t try to save a couple of bucks in costs. The USBC-USBC cables that they sent were also very long and gave the impression of high quality. Though I am cannot tell who they were made by. They had a code EP-DG977 on them. Note that you might receive something else (hopefully just as good if not better) than what I received.I am sure that someone else would very much enjoy these phones and find these a great value. I\'d have definitely kept both phones if I had been in the market for refurbished phones (I am guessing that the phones inside the unopened boxes were as high a quality as the attachments that were shipped with them.)Good Luck!', 'Bought Amazon warehouse. Great phone but missing an adaptor.', ""D'abord pour la caméra du téléphone qui déchire grave.  Aussi la manipulation c'est super fine merci"", 'I switched from Samsung and so far, I am impressed. The easy integration with the Google suite of products is a bonus!', ""It's a good phone, especially the camera. the photos are really amazing. The only problem for me was the jack audio. Fortunately, there is an adapter to solve it."", 'This is a mid-line phone at best. The speakers sound like they are from a radio in the 90s. The screen looks good, but you have to constantly adjust the brightness manually because it always goes away too dark. Last gripe I have is for the price, the battery life is to short. 24 hours for a falgahip phone is meh.Everything else just feels like a normal Android phone. The screen looks nice, you can install apps but there nothing that sets this phone apart. The camera might be good but I almost never used my camera. I am glad I got this on sale or I would probably return it.', ""The reviews from other purchasers about the pros and cons about this Pixel 7 pro are on  the dot like beautiful form of the phone; but there seems to have some challenges in picking up the correct case and screen protectors, the data transfer from my old phone to this Pixel u Pro was just like a breeze in an easy process with the use of the cable provided.  My only question remains with  the 128GB storage limitation with the absence of the slot for sd  ((storage drive) to augment my data  size that may exceed the 128 GB standard.  I usually have a 128 GB sd in my previouse phones.  I still have to see any purchasers' comments about this matter or do I have to transfer my photos & videos to my Google One 100 GB subscription or resort to this photo/video stick as I already used up the free 5 GB Amazon photo storage?

However, to avoid obsolescence, Blackberry made a good compromise in switching to Android, and I eagerly adopted the Priv, the KeyOne and finally, the Key2.As the Key2 was showing its age, I reluctantly decided to make the switch to the Titan Slim, knowing that I would be both downsizing, and upgrading, from the Key2.Therefore, this review of the Titan Slim is from the perspective of a Key2 owner. (Now, it would be silly to compare the Titan Slim with a high end phone that lacked a physical keyboard.) I own the BB100-6 version of the Key2, the international model with dual-sim, dual rear camera, 6GB RAM and 64GB storage, which supports keyboard scrolling.That out of the way, I would like to say that I was pleased with my experience with this phone after a couple of weeks of use. It does warrant a full 4 star rating.The phone was packaged thoughtfully and esthetically, with a minimalist but adequate user guide, more in line with a higher end phones these days. I was delighted to know that the screen was made of corning gorilla glass and came with a pre-installed screen protector, plus a spare protector in the box. It also included a rubber case, a headphone adapter, and its own branded power supply.As I did with the Key2, I decided to invest in a leather flip case (available through Amazon), to protect the screen and keyboard from damage.I was pleased to see that Titan Slim came with a clean, bug free installation of Android 11 OS, and it did not include the bloatware commonly found in many carrier branded phones.My initial experience with the phone  was slightly underwhelming with its default settings. It lacked the polished user experience of the Key 2. Thankfully, I was able to greatly improve my experience after getting rid of a few annoyances that bothered me.Here are those annoyances and the settings I changed to fix them:1. Screen looks slightly washed out. Fixed as follows: Settings->Display->MiraVision. Set Picture mode to vivid and turn Dynamic Contrast on.2. Overly sensitive HOME key. Fixed as follows: Settings->Intelligent assistance->Other settings->HOME key function->Double press to launcher. (The Home screen is now brought up with a double tap instead of a single touch.)3. Keyboard scrolling is off by default. Fixed as follows: Settings->Intelligent assistance->Scroll assistant->On.4. Keyboard backlight is off until you press a key. Fixed as follows: Settings->Display->Advanced->Keyboard Backlight->Keyboard backlight duration->Same as screen timeout.5. Web pages don’t display as much content as the Key2. Fixed as follows: Settings->Display->Advanced-> Font size->Small. (Note: This is very much my personal preference.)6. HOME key vibrates on touching. Fixed as follows: Settings->Accessibility->Vibration and haptic strength->Touch feedback->Off7. Google Voice Typing keeps popping up when typing. Fixed as follows: Settings->System->Languages and input->On-screen keyboard->Manage on-screen keyboard->Google Voice Typing->Off. (Kika-Keyboard should be on.)8. Headphone adapter is annoying to carry around and easy to lose. Fixed by keeping the headphone adapter permanently attached to my headphones. (That way I don’t have to worry about losing the adapter.)With Android Auto, I had issues with the phone\'s default settings (which, evidently, have been set to maximize battery life). Here are those issues and the settings I changed to fix them:1. Some apps, such as Spotify and Waze, are not working on Android Auto. Fixed as follows in two steps: (i) Settings->Apps and notifications->See all apps->Select particular app (e.g., Android Auto, Spotify, Waze, etc.)->Advanced->Battery->Battery Optimization (set it to “not optimized”). This will ensure that the app runs in the background. (ii) Settings->Intelligent assistance->App blocker->Select particular app (e.g., Assistant, Google, Maps, Spotify, Waze, etc.)->All blockers->Off2. Wireless Android Auto keeps dropping connection. Fixed as follows, after using Bluetooth to pair your phone with the Android Auto device: Settings->Connected devices->Select the Settings (gear) icon next to the name of the paired Android Auto device->HD Audio->Off (HD Audio setting seems to cause Bluetooth to interfere with the wifi connection. Other settings can be On). Note: This worked when I was connecting my phone with the Pioneer DMH-WT3800NEX Android Auto receiver unit.After getting rid of those annoyances, my experience is much better and I’m actually enjoying using the phone.The Titan ""Slim"" is both thicker and heavier than the Key2. Only its horizontal width is slimmer, so the ""Slim"" label is a bit of a puzzle. The thickness is probably the biggest difference in physical appearance, and this may be a deal breaker for some. However, with the added thickness, you do gain a larger and much longer lasting battery which is a good trade off.Downsizing from the 1620 x 1080, 4.5” screen (3.75"" x 2.5"") on the Key2 to the 1280 x 768 4.2"" (3.6"" x 2.16"") screen on the Titan Slim, was not really an issue as I had feared it would be. I just needed to switch the default font size to small, and I was able to browse web pages with nearly the same screen content as the Key2. Also, the slight drop in pixel density is not noticeable.Due to different aspect ratios, i.e., 3:2 on the Key2 versus 5:3 on the Titan Slim, the horizontal width is a third of an inch less, limiting the number of app icons on each row. (Please refer to my pictures.) Also, the screen real estate is reduced by 17%. This was the biggest compromise I would have to make.The camera is actually quite decent and adequate for everyday use, but you wouldn’t buy this phone for its camera. (See the attached picture of my breakfast.)The keyboard text prediction is satisfactory, but not exceptional (and neither is the text prediction on the Key2). I have installed and tested other virtual keyboard apps, including Google’s GBoard, Microsoft’s SwiftKey, and AnySoftKeyboard, but I found that the pre-installed Kika-keyboard’s implementation suits the Titan Slim more than these third party keyboard apps.The physical keys are indeed smaller than those on the Key2, but not by much as you will see in my pictures. The contoured keys provide nice tactile feedback. It only took me a few days to get my muscle memory adapted to the new keyboard, and I’m now enjoying typing with the same ease as I did before.I was glad that I was able to carry over my Blackberry experience seamlessly to the Titan Slim after installing the Blackberry Hub Inbox and Hub+ Services, and configuring the Titan Slim identically to the Key2. The LED indicator light on the Titan Slim integrates well with Blackberry Hub notifications.I downloaded, installed and configured apps almost identically to the apps on my Key2, including the Wallpapers app. The Transparent Weather Clock app I had on the Key2 didn\'t work as well on the Titan Slim, so I replaced it with the Weawow app to get the weather widget to display correctly on the home screen.With all that done, I was able to get back most of the Key2’s polished experience with the Titan Slim.The call quality on the Titan Slim is very good, but the downward facing speaker on the Titan Slim can  make the speakerphone sound a bit high pitched. (I cover the speaker at the bottom of my phone with my finger to lower the pitch when watching videos.)  Having said that, when I use the headphone adapter and connect my Sennheiser headphones, the sound quality from the phone is very good. Spotify music quality using headphones is almost on par with that of my iPad.Now here’s why the Titan Slim is a great upgrade from the Blackberry Key2:- Android 11 OS versus Android 8.1. Definitely a step up in OS experience and you can sleep easier.- 256GB storage versus 64GB, which means you won’t need to worry about space filling up.- Snappier performance. Apps open and respond noticeable faster. (Although you wouldn\'t buy this phone for gaming.)- Superior battery life. With my typical usage of 2.5 to 3 hours a day, my phone’s battery lasts 2.5 to 3 days (versus just over a day on Key 2).- The mobile reception on the Titan Slim is a noticeable improvement over the Key2 (although the call clarity is about the same)- Last but not least, price. It’s less than half the price of the Key2 and 50% cheaper than the Key2 LE.Given that the Blackberry Key2\'s Hub experience is duplicated on the Unihertz Titan Slim (with the LED notification included as a bonus), that it matches the capability of the Key2 in most respects (after tweaking the default settings), and that it improves upon the Key2’s performance, I have no hesitation in giving it a 4 star rating.I took off a point for the slightly less polished keyboard experience, the slightly shrill sounding speakerphone, and reduced screen real estate.Yes, you do compromise on the screen size and some of the bells and whistles. But this is the trade off a Blackberry user needs to make to extend their Blackberry experience by a few years.', ""I know a lot of you will be wondering is this the replacement to my key2?For me it's a no but a respectful effort from titan.I hope for all of us there get there one day.- The screen was too cramped.- Keyboard too compact and not as tactile as the IMO perfectly crafted key2 keyboard but still a good effort from titan. I would describe the keyboard as somewhere between the priv and the keyone with priv at the bottom and key2 at the top.- Lacking keyboard funcfuntions like swiping back on the track pad to remove words while typing. A feature I adore! Also highlighting function when you hold shift and scroll up on the track pad to remove entire sentences.- speaker sound was tinny- screen not as nice (Maybe I just wasn't used to it)- lack of quality feel the blackberry had- also the battery felt like it took an age to charge and maybe wasn't as good as the key2. I didn't use it enough to understand what was going on but for me the key2 on a dull screen was always going to last more than a day with heavy use and I didn't get that impressions from the titan but I have seen that others reported similar and other not.I'm only noting the bad because for me these were deal breakers. There is plenty of good effort here but not enough for me to switch. Yet.Lets hope they can build from here towards that blackberry replacement we all seek but for now I'm sticking with a new key2 to replace my old one which lasted 4 years no problems until the battery needed replacing."", ""This is a tricky review to write as because in every respect I feel duty bound to compare this phone to my beloved Blackberry Priv which met with an unfortunate end after years of faithful service and thus pushed me to seek a replacement.Like anyone else who prefers a physical keyboard, you the reader may have found yourself considering this phone and reading the reviews as I did.So to summarise first. This isn't a Blackberry Priv. Not by quite a stretch. But it is a good solid reliable Android phone with a decent battery life and a physical keyboard. And it is the only one I could find on the market. So buy it. Like I did. Because we want Unihertz (no, I'd never heard of them either) to keep making more when no-one else is.I've now been running it for over two months and aside from a software quirk where the camera fails to take photos after screen lock unlock (unless you clear it from memory), it is working perfectly. An initial worry when buying technology from unrecognised brands.So, the phone itself.Keyboard: Its greatest strength and a weakness. It isn't as good as the Priv which was near perfect. The keys feel a little close and it sometimes feels a little too low on the phone for a comfortable grip. The layout doesn't feel very natural, but I'm starting to get used to it. One bonus though is there are several programmable keys. And it is the only phone with a keyboard. Hopefully Unihertz will recognise some faults and change it in any subsequent model.Camera: Decent enough, but nothing amazing. This isn't the phone for you if you want stunning photographs, but it equally as good as the Priv and better than it in poor light.Durability: With the free case and screen protectors that come with it, this feels like a solid phone in your hands. Not sure where the slim comes from in the name as it most certainly isn't, but personally that actually makes it feel more sturdy. It has a decent build and body finish and has been dropped once (what killed the Priv), but survived 100% intact.Screen Size: For a modern phone, the screen feels small. Much smaller than the Priv as the physical keyboard doesn't slide away and it isn't to the edges of the phone. Maybe Unihertz will improve that in a later model, but it does fel like precious space on the front of the phone is wasted. It does the job though and for my eyes, Android allows you to change your standard font size. Plus, it feels easier to fit into pockets than many modern rivals.Battery: In fairness, the Priv's battery was dying so this might skew my opinion, but the Titan Slim's battery life appears to be great. I easily get a couple of days out of it with fairly heavy internet use. Although I personally don't keep location or bluetooth on unless needed and keep my screen brightness to approx three quarters.Dual Sim: Handy for me, it was also dual sim which it handles well. The above battery life includes separate network scanning for the two sims.Memory / Storage: Both equally ample without setting any records. It doesn't have an expansion slot, but the internal storage is pretty generous and seems fast when used. No delay for photos to be stored, etc..Cost: It is considerably cheaper (£200+) than my Priv was and far cheaper than many phones out there, but it doesn't feel it.Niggles: There's no stereo jack socket, but they do supply a USB adapter with the phone. Not sure how many people will be bothered by that, but I still use it to play the phone back through an older stereo in the house.Bonus: The Amazon offering came with a cover, screen protectors and bluetooth ear phones.Hope that helps someone reading. My recommendation. Buy it. If you don't, Unihertz might not make another in future and then there'll be precisely no options on the market for those who want a physical keyboard.Hope that helps."", 'Vorteile: Tastatur, grosser Akku, DoppelSim, Huelle und SchuSpeicherkartetzfolie schon montiert, IR FernbedienungNachteile:Android 11 ist ein einziger Bug, Geraet ist dick und schwer, kein Klinkenanschluss, keine Speicherkarte, Rueckseie ohne Huelle zu glatt, rutscht ueberall runter. Gehaeuse empfindlicher Kunststoff', ""Well, I own this phone for about 2 weeks and moving from Blackberry Key2 (I will be comparing between these two devices). I am using it mostly for text communicaton. I am going to be very straight in this little review.Build quality is very good. Dimensions are OK, even it is quite thicker. Device power is sufficient for my use case. Display should be quite wider (I like dimensions of Key2). Android 11 is way better than 8.1. Camera is OK for ordinary use. Nothing extra, but not bad.KEYBOARD:Comparing to previous (big) Titan it is much much better (finally ctrl+ shortcuts, better keys, better keyboard layout), but comparing to Key2, it is a little bit worse. The worst thing, for me personally, is keyboard layout, where functional keys are placed in the upper row. sometimes it is not very user friendly. Second, what should be  corrected on Titan Slim 2 is that, keyboard should be moved little bit higher from bottom of the phone.What I like very much are hardware Android control buttons (triangle, square). Typing is ok, but I need more practice to learn this phone.It will be good to have possibility to change keyboard layout (qwerty/qwertz) in the system.System is classic Android + few extras by Unihertz (extras are not translated very well into Slovak language). Security updates or system upgrades in the future are mystical, but Blackberry screwed this very soon too.The biggest problem of this phone so far is its WiFi, which cannot handle WPA-3 or MFP (802.11w Main Frame Protection). You have to disable these to get stable wifi connection. If you don't phne will disconnect every few minutes.Unihertz suppport knows about this and I hope they will be able to fix this. This is the reason that I rate this phone to 4 stars. If they will fix it, I will change it to 5 stars.Result:If you are hardware keyboard fan, you have definitely to buy this phone. At least as a support for the last company making this type of phones.Everything, except wifi problem, mentioned above, is working great.PS:My personal suggestions to Unihertz for this phone and its successors are:Design - get inspired by Key2 (keyboard layout, keyboard placement, dimensions)Software - ask LineageOS developers or someone from xdadevelopers forum for help with OS maintenance = regular updates and upgrades"", ""I've only had this handset for a couple of days, so this review is based on my initial impressions, in comparison with my previous phone, which was a Blackberry Key2.PROS:- Physical keyboard (which was the main attraction for me.)- Runs a newer version of Android than the Blackberry Key2.- Decent picture quality.- WiFi seems fine.- Holds an acceptable charge.- Lots of storage space.- Reasonably priced.CONS:- Extremely slow to charge, with no boost option.- No SD card slot.- No headphone port (headphones must be connected to the charging port with an adapter, which is supplied.)- Weird, fiddly keyboard layout, which will take some getting used to.- Small screen for the phone size. Lots of wasted space.- Inputted local contacts disappear. Only Google contacts remain stored. (This may be a glitch with my particular handset.)- When you press the square button, to view your open apps and pages, there is no option to close some individually, and keep others open.- No option to disable shift key from sending messages, so impossible to create line breaks in some apps.- No flip case available for this model yet, but I'm hoping that caseroxx will release one, as they have for previous models.Overall, this handset feels cramped and fiddly, in comparison with the Blackberry Key1 or Key2, and is missing a number of functions that I had come to rely on. However, as the Key2 is no longer commerically available, runs a near-obsolete operating system, and costs £800+ (new) from private sellers, the Unihertz Titan Slim is probably a better option for those who, like me, desire a physical keyboard above other functions."", ""A livello di utilizzo, preferivo il BlackBerry.

I went from a Motorola Moto G Stylus 2020 (not 5G) to this. I was happy with my old phone, but I wished it was just a tad faster. I would still have it if I hadn\'t accidentally smashed it without a case on it. I researched for hours during Prime Days deciding between this phone and something cheaper to see if it was worth it. I even considered getting the exact same 2020 model I had since I liked it. I finally decided that if I was going to spend money on a new phone, I might as well upgrade and get the latest version of the Android operating system.I firmly believe that if a change is made from an older model/website/whatever, it should be an improvement. While I will say this model is without a doubt noticeably faster than the one I had, this phone changes many things that are simply that, changes, and they are not an improvement over the 2020 model I had. Below are some of the differences I\'ve found over the months that are not as good as the old phone I had.- When pulling the stylus out when the screen is on (device is unlocked), there is no longer an option in the shortcuts to open previously saved notes. Opening a new note and several useless options are available like take a screen shot or create a GIF, but no longer an icon for saved notes. It\'s already faster to open a new note when the screen is off (device is locked), so I don\'t need an icon to pop up giving me that same option when the screen is on.- There is no longer an option to save the stylus writing size. Whenever I start using the stylus, the default drawing thickness is too thick for my liking. It takes up too much room for a phone screen. I change it to a smaller size, but it doesn\'t save this setting, unlike the 2020 model. Even when I save a note and go back to it later, the default thickness is again used rather than the smaller size I was using before. They just did a big update to the stylus functionality, but Motorola still didn\'t fix this.- There is no longer a button to save notes. It automatically saves any changes made whether you want to save them or not. You have to erase them if you want to go back to what you had saved. It even automatically saves blank notes if you accidentally open a new note. Some people might like the auto save, but I want the option to save or discard when I change my mind or make a mistake.- Every time I restart the phone, there is a notification to explore or eject the SD card that I have to swipe away. It\'s considered a system notification and they don\'t allow me to disable it permanently. This useless notification did not happen on the 2020 model, but it was a problem with the Motorola slider phone I had many years ago. I guess they decided to bring the annoyance back.- When I pull down the top menu and then pull down again to expand it, I have to reverse that sequence and swipe up twice to close the top menu. I only had to swipe up once to get back to my home screen on the 2020 model even when I was in the expanded top menu.- Ads on a particular app I\'ve been using for years are so, so much more obnoxious now! And so much more obnoxious than when I use that same app on my tablet currently. Ads are longer, they open up the Play store or open the browser even if I tap the X a dozen times and I end up having to use my stylus to press the X to finally close it. And then it still doesn\'t always close the ad. I have to wait 5 more seconds for another X to come up to finally close the ad. I don\'t know how or why changing phone models would do this, but it started happening immediately upon using the new phone. It\'s not an app update because my app was up-to-date. It wouldn\'t surprise me if Motorola is receiving some kind of kickback to do this on their cheaper phones. It may seems silly, but it makes me not want to buy another Motorola in the future because this is a quality of life issue.- The most recent update has made swiping an app closed more difficult, which I have to do quite often now that ads are opening up the Play store or the browser. I have to remember to swipe up from the middle of the app rather than the bottom. If I try swiping up from the bottom now, it just moves the screen left or right. I get frustrated sometimes and find it easier to clear all the apps. I hope they will fix this bug since it just started.- I\'m no longer able to silence an app separate from other media volume. Once I turn media volume back up, the sound on the app I just silenced comes back on. I absolutely loved this feature on my 2020 phone because it silenced ads for the app and I could still listen to music. For a little while it seemed to be working and every time I opened a particular app, a notice popped up letting me know it was silencing the app. That pop up was annoying enough, but now it\'s no longer silencing that app I wanted silenced all the time.- It comes with TikTok pre-installed. Motorola opened up my private information and my contacts to a Chinese company that must hand over data if the Chinese government requests it. Again, makes me not want to ever own another Motorola. I feel betrayed by them.- Transferring data from an old phone to a new one took hours longer with this phone than any other time. Even longer than when I switched from an iPhone back to an Android and iPhone never made anything I did easy compared to Android. Additionally, I ended up having an issue transferring texts over from my texting app and then I gave up the next day and did a factory reset. Transferring the data went better the second time (more saved data transferred) and I went with a different texting app as well so I didn\'t have the issue from the previous day. That issue with the texts had nothing to do with the phone, but why was I able to move more saved data the second time? And I had to go out of my way to transfer saved stylus notes using my PC. They transferred automatically when I went from LG to Motorola, but not when I went from Motorola to Motorola.- Finally, the phone is too tall my my liking. I struggle with reaching my thumb to the top of the screen sometimes and the added screen size doesn\'t hold any more icons since the OS just makes more space around the icons. The display in my car will hit the top of the phone when it closes into the dash if I forget to grab the phone out of the holder before turning the car off. It sticks out of my back pocket in men\'s jeans. That means it\'s too big. My LG Stylo 6 two phones ago was about this size and I was happy with the smaller, sleeker comfort of my 2020 Motorola. The added length does nothing for usability. I guess it\'s my fault for not considering this before purchasing.The ability to customize the look with the new OS is not worth it. I thought I would be able to change the color of individual apps so I wouldn\'t accidentally tap on the wrong google app because they all use the same color scheme. If there is a way to do this, I can\'t figure out how. I did change the color theme for the phone and didn\'t realize it was going to also change my background image to match whatever their theme was. I lost a cherished old photo of my dog that had been the background image. I was able to replace it with another, but it\'s not quite as good. I also thought security with the new OS was supposed to be improved. It is nice that I can choose approximate location when apps needlessly want my location, but they keep asking me if I want to switch to exact location when I open those apps. No, I do not. I also get periodic messages from the OS to make sure I really want to keep certain permissions I\'ve already granted. Yes, I still want my recorder to have access to my microphone. Not sure how it will record things without it.This phone is faster than my previous Motorola for sure, but I could deal with apps opening a little bit slower over all this. Maybe the battery lasts longer, I really don\'t notice as it was pretty good before. The cameras seem about the same too, which is not all that good. I tried to get a good photo of the the moon that looked like a hazy red due to Canada wildfires and it looked like a tiny spec in night mode and a grainy mass in zoom. My sister-in-law texted me a great photo using her Google Pixel. I guess I do like the fingerprint button being on the side rather than the back, but that alone doesn\'t make ""upgrading"" worth it. And I rarely make use the the 5G. When I\'m at home, I\'m on wifi. When I\'m around town, for the most part I\'m connected to wifi at whatever business I\'m at. When I\'m away from home visiting family, if I\'m not on their wifi, my phone provider doesn\'t currently have any 5G towers in that area and probably won\'t until after I upgrade to something better than Motorola in the future.Had I known Motorola was going to make so many things worse on this supposed upgraded model, I would have paid to have my screen repaired on my 2020 model. It\'s just not something you expect to happen with a newer model. And the reviews I read at the time didn\'t have a thorough comparison to what I had. I will keep this model because I refuse to spend hundreds more dollars on something else, but Motorola probably won\'t get any more of my business unless I find out they fixed these changes on cheaper models and value their customers again.', 'Likes:I was searching for a decent phone in the $200 price range.  I found this Moto G Stylus 5G0 (2022) for $249, which was a little over my budget, but it was such a good deal that I decided to swallow hard and spend the extra fifty bucks to get 8GB RAM and 256GB storage capacity.  As of March 20, 2023, after about two and a half weeks of use, I like this Android 12 phone overall.  I have never owned a phone that just came out the year before (2022) so this was a rare treat for me.The battery life is a much improved capability over my old Galaxy S5.  I kept the S5 models for years because they had a removable battery, but the old Droid 6 operating system just became too buggy and I decided to switch carriers and upgrade to this Moto G Stylus 5G (2022).  This Moto will stay at 100% battery for 6-8 standby hours if you are not constantly sending/receiving messages or making calls.  I am not a big user of phones for other than occasional internet searches, weather, short calls and texts.  Under such moderate usage, you will certainly get at least 24 hours or more of battery life.A stylus is an added option that I like, but it is mostly just a toy for me, as I do not really require a stylus for anything I might do.  I bought this phone based on:  1)  price,  2)  battery life,  3)  being a name brand.The screen is sufficiently vibrant in colors and you have several different options as far as screen appearance, icon sizes, etc.  The improved differences in Droid 12 over Droid 6 in scalable settings in all areas of phone operation is significant.The camera is somewhat better than the one in my old Galaxy S5, and that is acceptable to me.  I am not a big photographer, using it mostly to take pictures of items so that I get the right parts match at the store later and sometimes I use it to take pictures of items for online sales listings.  The selfie camera is not a concern of mine and I do not have an opinion on it but I read professional reviews of its capabilities which described it as adequate.  Games and social media make absolutely no difference to me since I do not engage in either one of them, so I cannot give an opinion on using this phone for those things.  8GB RAM and 256GB storage should be capable of handling almost anything you might wish to do.Boost Mobile is the AT&T reseller carrier that I selected when I moved to their 5G network.  Verizon was the main reason I was forced to make a switch.  Out where I live, Verizon did something to their 4G network, perhaps they were changing it over to 5G, I am not sure.  In any case, it became virtually impossible to make calls from inside my home or shop during the past year and a half and this is totally unacceptable.  With this Moto G Stylus 5G (2022) I can now make calls on the AT&T 5G network from anywhere in my home or shop and I have not had a single dropped call in the past two and a half weeks.Dislikes:Lack of a message notification light and a non-removable battery are the reasons that I gave this Moto G Stylus 5G (2022) only four stars.  In fact, I thought hard about giving it only three stars but decided that was too big a slam on the phone overall.It irritates the living hell out of me that for $250 Motorola could not put a message notification light on the phone.  I work at home and in my shop mostly, so the ability to just put the phone on a table near meand not have to carry it physically on me is preferable to my delicate and refined sensibilities.  Yeh.  If I walk away from the phone for a few minutes,  I then enjoy being able to walk by and look at the phone without having to touch the screen or pick it up to see if I have a message.  My old Galaxy S5 had a notification light that told you everything you needed to know at a glance and I very much miss this feature.  As far as I have been able to determine, there is no notification setting in Droid 12 that allows the screen to periodically flash or any other such option that would enable you to see if you have a message without actually touching the phone.My preference is for a smaller phone, such as was the Galaxy S5, but this is not really a dislike of this Moto G Stylus 5G (2022).  It is a larger phone and I knew the size difference before I bought it and am OK with this.  Truth be told, I really wanted to stay with Samsung and the Galaxies, but a comparable model in their line was at least $450 to $500, so that was definitely out of my budget, and Galaxy models that had less RAM and storage were still $400, so Motorola G Stylus 5G (2022) got my vote at $250.As with almost all new phones, the battery is NOT removable.  You get only one battery for the life of the phone and it lasts as long as it lasts.  Of course, I do not know how long that will be.  I hope that with below average usage this will be at least three, and (God willing) four years, but there is no way to know this battery longevity at this point.  That is a reason I kept my old S5 models for so long - I could keep replacing the batteries.  Now MAYBE we will have Tubes released later by motivated service-to-others oriented individuals that tell us how to get into this phone without breaking it and replace the battery ourselves, but until that happens we must assume that the one battery is all the longevity you get.Motorola says that they will offer operating system updates and support for three years.  I believe this to  be very chintzy of them.  As a user who, barring accidental destruction of the phone, keeps a phone for as long as it still operates correctly, I think that Motorola is very much shortchanging customers by providing only three years of support.And that is that.  Happy travels.', ""I have had this phone for 3 weeks, so far it works well, I haven't used the fingerprint reader at all for fear that it doesn't like my finger when I go to use it, and I have no complaints about the battery life and touch screen, however a day ago I dropped my phone while at work and the bottom of my phone hit the floor first and the stylus popped out and it bent, I didn't notice at first that it bent until I was having issues getting the button of the stylus to pop out far enough where I could pull it back out of my phone and I had to use my keys to press the button down far enough so it would pop out, I managed to bend it back and it seems fine now.I was concerned at first if my phone would be compatible with boost mobile since I was transferring from total by verizon to boost and I went into one of the two active boost stores in my city, first one a lady broke a sim card out of the holder, stuck it in my phone, and a few seconds later told me my phone wasn't compatible. Be careful when having employees check your phone because when I got home I cleaned up the phone to send it back and mentioned to my sister what happened at boost and she took her boost sim out of her phone and tried it and it worked, it was showing the service was boost mobile, and after she rebooted my phone she checked the about section and her phone number was in there. I was really annoyed about this because I didn't want to send the phone back and it almost got sent back. I went to another boost store to start the process of transferring over and I had my sim from total by verizon in my phone and the woman who was testing my phone told me my phone was not compatible with boost, I had my mother with me and we both were arguing back with the lady that my phone was compatible and that it worked with my sisters sim card and the lady was telling us that my phone (which is factory unlocked, i'm the first owner) could have been locked by the carrier I was using, we ended up having to go home to get some info for the transfer and I tested my moms sim card which was also boost and my phone accepted it and I did a test call and called my dads phone and it worked. I ended up buying a new phone through boost, boosts version of this phone with the intent of giving it to my mom and I have not had a single issue with my phone and my boost service since I moved my boost sim into my unlocked phone."", ""Got this to replace my aging moto g8 power. Decided to go with moto once again since the price was in my budget.Cons:1. Lower volume than my g8 power. I have problems hearing phone calls with this. I have to find a really quiet place.2.

It's a battery eater but worth it."", ""I would give this a 3.5 star if I could, but I thought a solid 3 was too low.I was in the market for a new phone, and I was looking for one with a NFC reader.But I wasn't about to buy a 800+ Dollar moto edge for them to take away features like the headphone jack and Micro SD card slot.But as far as I could tell, non of their newer phones had an NFC chip without giving up those other features.I was about ready to give up and try searching other brands until they dropped this little gem a few months ago.It costs significantly less than the edge+, and it has all the features I was looking for in a phone without any tradeoffs! (At least on paper)Before I get into my main issue with this phone however, I will say every other aspect of this phone seemed great.Stylus is solid metal as well, nice quality.That said...The camera really was not impressive for me.Honestly speaking, it kinds sucked when put up against my expectations...I currently own a 2017 Moto g7 Power (12MP Single Camera), and before that a Droid Turbo 2 (21MP Single Camera).I used to love my Turbo 2, the camera was awesome!I was sad to give it up due to the failing battery, but the g7 while noticeable drop in camera quality, had an awesome battery!(Honestly, battery matters more to me than camera anyways.)When I found the Stylus 5G and noticed it had the same battery size as my current phone, plus all these features, I was super excited.But once I got the phone, the picture quality on the claimed 50MP camera was no better than the 12MP on my current one....I have 2 simple tests for this, take pictures of clouds, and take pictures of my pants.This tests both long distance and short distance image quality, and I judge it by how many details I can spot in the clouds, and how clear/easy it is to see the cloth pattern on my pants.Verdict: Barely any noticeable difference...Normally I wouldn't be this critical of a phone, but for me to be able to notice a significant difference between 12MP Cam and a good 21MP Cam, but for a 12MP and a 50MP to be almost equal?.....Sorry, but the claims don't match the results in my eyes.(Also tried multiple settings like Ultra Resolution and Pro mode, and even post editing. Didn't Help)I do have a theory for why this might be happening though.This phone has a quad Pixel Feature.Quick Photography lesson:Photo sensors with larger Pixels sensors can absorb more light, allowing for better Night shots.That's why a lot of newer cameras couldn't take good night shots while a lot of older cameras did better.As the tech got smaller and more detailed, it gave up being able to absorb more light for night shots.That said:Quad Pixel Mode is a feature where the small pixels on a camera combine in groups of 4 to mix data and behave as if they're one bigger pixel. (ergo: Quad Pixel)This allows for better shots in low light conditions.Long story short, I think the camera might be stuck in Quad Pixel Mode.50MP / 4 = 12.5MPWhen you look at that math, it makes sense why the phones camera's have hardly any difference in quality.Problem is, I returned it for a replacement phone, and ran into the same issue...(That's two phones that had bad cameras)I really want to love this phone, but I got my hopes to high for a ALL the features.And I didn't really want to compromise when paying this much for a phone.So I returned the replacement.Hopefully this is just something software side that will be fixed later for other buyers.I did find another moto phone from last year that looks like it might fit my needs better.Even if the camera (108MP) is a quarter as good as it claims it will be better than this phone.And to top it off it's 200$ cheaper and has a bigger battery."", ""I was a very early adopter of the original Moto G Stylus (2020). Yes, that put me at a Sprint store right at the start of COVID trying to get the phone activated, which it actually failed to do at the store and it wasn't until 24 hours later that I was finally able to activate it myself at home.Well, if nothing else, the Moto G Stylus 5G 20202 phone was super easy to activate on T-Mobile and I didn't even have to risk getting COVID to do it! Seriously, I'm like 98% completely satisfied with this phone.It's MUCH faster than the OG Moto G Stylus, even though the processor isn't that significant of an upgrade.  However there are other factors in the speed like it's still a newer CPU and GPU, it has 8GB of RAM instead of just 4GB, it has 120mhz screen instead of just a 90mhz, etc. I also think Android 12 has something to do with the speed increase, too.I love that it still comes with expandable storage via MicroSD on the SIM card tray, and I even still love the good ol' headphone jack.  USB-C is common these days, but it still has that. I do like the new stylus pen better than the OG stylus pen. I probably won't use it much if at all, but I am glad to see the return of NFC to USA model.The 5000 mAh battery is just incredible. I have literally carried my phone with me (and frequently used it) for 8 hours and it only goes down 15-20%. With my OG Moto G Stylus, I would lose 20-30% of the battery just overnight sitting on my nightstand. With this phone I literally lose 0-1% overnight.  It's crazy.So what's the 2% I don't like?  Well, I'm a little disappointed that it doesn't have wireless charging. Since I had that with the Motorola Nexus 6 phone, I've been missing it through having the Moto G5S Plus, the Moto G Stylus 2020, and now the Moto G Stylus 5G 2022. Yes, I realize it's a mid-range phone, but it really doesn't take much to add wireless charging. And the other 1% is the cameras in the new phone -- they're just not as good as the Moto G Stylus 2020 cameras and I can't find a Gcam port that will fully support all 4 cameras. I also miss the portrait actioncam mode of the Moto G Stylus 2020. The cameras in the Moto G Stylus 5G 2022 are decent, if not even very good, but the OG Stylus simply had better camera hardware.Lastly, I do love the seafoam green color.  I'm tired of black (or even dark blue) phones, and it's nice to shake things up a bit.  I even when with a clear case so even when protected I'm still sporting a seafoam green phone."", ""Brought this phone over 2 weeks ago. Noticed periodic delayed calls when it's 5G LTE network with 5 bars of signals. The screen is equivalent to Samsung Galaxy S21 and takes good pictures.  This phone comes standard with 3 homescreens, has features that will accommodate seniors like big buttons, enlarged text, change language used, etc.  I read in someone's review before purchasing this phone the battery life was great.  After a full charge, minimal use only for phone calls, the battery lasted about a day and half."", 'Es el segundo equipo que compro .Este es de mi esposa y está muy contenta .', ""It just works...it's got space, the pictures are good, it's fast....and FINALLY, an NFC chip!!

No geral eu estou gostando muito e achei excelente custo benefício', 'Começando a avaliação pelo primeiro ponto:1 - Vi alguns comentários de pessoas que não receberam o produto e acredito que isso teria acontecido comigo se não tivesse colocado pressão no vendedor pelo chat. Isso porque o código de rastreio que foi disponibilizado no dia de ""postagem"" não era válido, não era reconhecido por nenhum meio pelos correios e enfim. Entrei em contato com o vendedor VÁRIAS VEZES, e ele finalmente me respondeu dizendo que ""os correios não identificaram meu produto, mas ele faria uma nova postagem por Sedex"", nunca havia acontecido algo do tipo comigo. A postagem por sedex foi feita e recebi o produto dentro do prazo, entretanto acredito que se não tivesse falado com o vendedor, não teria recebido o produto.2 - Quanto ao celular, sempre antes de abrir caixas de aparelhos eletrônicos eu gravo um vídeo abrindo e testando para caso tenha algum problema eu consiga respaldo judicial, se necessário. Conferi todos os números de Imei que nele continham (do adesivo traseiro, da caixa e principalmente do próprio smartphone) e todos eles bateram com o site da Xiaomi de autenticidade, ou seja, o meu aparelho é original.

Everything I expected and more. Placed the order from Singapore and it was delivered within a week. Heading read the previous reviews, I was concerned that I would receive the Japan model (camera shutter sound cannot be disabled) but after some checking with the seller, they assured me it was indeed an international model. The packaging was a little dirty in places and the box was opened and resealed but the phone itself is beautifully new, no issues at all. Yes it heats up target quickly but this is a manufacturing problem, not the seller's problem. Battery life is amazing compared to my Pixel 3. It also takes amazing photos, which was the reason why I bought it. The phone comes with a data transfer cable, so I was able to make the switch easily. Overall I'm very satisfied.Edit: if you find your Pixel 6 Pro heats up quickly, do what I did. Turn off smooth scrolling, social share, google lens suggestions, and 5G. Worked like a charm for me."", 'Good camera.  But the os/hardware will eventually put the phone into restart loops that will make the device unusable.  For the cost that you are paying, having an unusable device in just 1year is not worth it.  Better quality devices avilble in the market.  Prefer the other ones as this one is not worth the price.', ""Google Pixel 6 Pro is an amazing device. I opted for the unlocked version to use with Spectrum Mobile, and 256GB since I sometimes had more than 128GB on my last phone (photos, videos, downloaded maps for Google Maps and outdoors apps,etc.).First, let's address 5G service: It is hit-or-miss. It ain't the phone's fault, it's just the nature of 5G. It has very short range from towers (that's why 5G towers are popping up in subdivisions, city streets, etc.) and can't penetrate buildings like earlier services. So, don't blame the phone if 5G don't work where you are. 4G and LTE are your reliable friends. Also, even if you do have 5G showing on the phone, don't expect blazing speeds. I've tested speeds with 5G on and off while sitting in restaurants, doctors offices, city traffic (as a passenger) and at home. Sometimes 5G is 200mbps or better, and sometimes it is slower than 4G/LTE. It depends on distance from the tower, signal strength and traffic on the tower. Don't write negative reviews for any phone based on unrealistic 5G wishes.Now, about the Pixel 6 Pro:Here's what I like:1.  The very large screen lets me read without always using reading glasses.2.  Battery life seems to be very good for the amount and types of usage. I try to stay between 20-80% charge for longevity sake.3.  The cameras (3 of them) are very good. I opted for the 3-camera 6 Pro for the cameras, allowing me to capture travel scenes without the added weight and hassle of the Nikon plus it's lenses, charger, etc. We just returned from Aruba, and I didn't miss the Nikon at all. I use the wide angle (0.7x) and telephoto (4x) a lot, and it's pretty good when you use digital zoom at 20x. I use the photosphere feature often when traveling, and it's a great way to share the experiences. And, the night and astrophotography capabilities are way better than expected. Get a mini tripod and try those sometimes (astrophotography shots can take 4 minutes). As a guy that used manual film cameras before digital was possible, I would like more control of the camera functions, but there are apps for that. After your images upload to Google Photos, try the Magic Eraser editing tool you've heard about to get rid of unwanted people or cars from a scene. It ain't totally automatic, but it sure beats the old ways of doing it. I don't shoot many videos, but I might now that I have better capabilities. If concerned about scratching the cameras, apply a tempered glass protector for the camera. It's cheap and easy. And they have a cutout for the flash and microphone.4.  Phone calls are reliable and clear. No problems with dropped calls.5.  Google's Spam Filters prevent most calls from getting through. If an unwanted call (or one you can't answer immediately) rings, flip the phone face-down to shush it. Better yet, turn the ringer off before church service starts.6.  The fingerprint reader works fine for me. Take time to train it for more than one finger, and increase sensitivity before applying a screen protector.7.  There are many useful settings, so take your time and explore them.8.  International use was easy. All I had to do was call Spectrum Mobile to enable international use, then take off. They charge per minute for calls, per text message, and per MB for data (please turn off mobile data roaming). It was super easy and reliable in Aruba, although we did get a welcome to Jamaica message.Now, what I don't like: Nothing. I did my research and knew what to expect. Who would order a phone costing over $1000 (taxes, accessories, etc.) without knowing what they're getting? I could gripe that it's too tall for most shirt pockets, but I specifically wanted a big screen, so it ain't Google's fault. I could gripe about the swiping gestures, but I like them after learning how they work. There are many other smartphones out there, so do your own homework and buy one you like.Would I buy this phone again? Yes. Absolutely. But I was hoping the 7 Pro could be available before I killed my Pixel 3. Oh well, that's neither phone's fault."", 'Este celular de gama alta viene con bastantes funciones de IA en cuestión de fotografía, dictado, traducción entre otros, lo único que no me termina de convencer es que la cámara no tenga un modo pro, tiene algunos detalles en cuanto a bugs de navegación que no son de relevancia pero que no deberían estar para la gama del teléfono, al ser un modelo de estados unidos el me he percatado que la señal no es muy buena y fluctúa demasiado esto con la chip tel cel teniendo 4g. Eso sí el celular es muy llamativo y por sus materiales muy resbaladizo así que toca comprarle una funda. No sé si tenga que ver con la IA de la cámara pero utilizando el x2 para fotos de retrato la mayoría de las veces las fotos al hacer zoom salen muy esmeriladas y es muy incómodo como si fuera demasiado procesado, tienes que configurar para que te saque un archivo RAW y modificar en una app externa lightroom por ejemplo.

The phone is exactly how it was described. There is hardly any flaws on it except for a teeny tiny little scratch which is not even visible in the lower right hand corner. The rest of the phone is in immaculate condition. This is my first pixel so I really didn't know what to look forward to. After doing plenty of research on the internet and on YouTube, I figured I was getting a pretty good phone. So far it has ran very smoothly. It was indeed unlocked because I just popped my SIM card in and it worked perfectly. It has the latest update and was easy to switch from one phone to another. The shipping time was very quick. The package was very well protected to make sure that the product showed up to me and good working condition. I would highly recommend the seller to whomever's looking to get a new device"", ""Although this phone is faster, has more ram, 5g, bigger battery and higher screen refresh rate.... The screen is a downgrade from the oled on my 3xl. Pixel 6 pro is on the blue side with white balance and  actually has less pixel density than 3xl. When I look back at my 523ppi 3xl with the warmer white balance and better blacks I miss it.The speakers on my older 3XL are much louder than the 6 Pro.  I think the speakers on this phone lack volume compared to any other phone I've heard.  Dissapointed.The front fingerprint reader is annoying and any glass screen protector is going to have a circular finger dot visible in the middle of the screen where the thumbprint goes which looks horrible with the screen on or off.  Should have kept the reader in the rear like the 3xl.The curved glass edges of the screen are supposed to look more premium, but the color and tint changes around the edges when you look at it from slight angles.  Also makes it hard to select button near the edges of the screen  The bluish tint is a hige dissapointment, and putting the phone on the 'nightlight' warm tint is just far too warm.  Would have been nice to have a neutral white/grey interface.I bought a notebook style case that is supposed to be magnetic on the front to hold the flap closed, but there is no metal edges to work with the magnet.  At angles the curved edges of the screen look dim and discolored... very distracting to the overall aesthetic and makes the phone look cheap.The camera lenses are good ... an improvement.  The 4x Telephoto and taller screen are the only real upgrades I appreciate.The larger 5000 mah battery takes longer to charge and you will only be able to buy a 30amp charger from googles website which I am still waiting for delivery.  Phone seems to burn through battery quickly with the faster screen refresh rate. I have turned it off so it stays on 60fps for now.To use assistant you need to press the power button and hold it down.  Not sure if you can even call it a power button, because I could not figure out how to power off my phone in the beginning.Overall this is a really good phone that takes great pictures, but for it's time, the 3XL had better speakers and a better OLED screen.  Google seemed to focus more on the software upgrades than the hardware upgrades and it is noticeable when side by side with a Samsung Galaxy S22.... however the Galaxy is $500 more so it makes sense.The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 3 is because I bought it for the photography, and image quality has not disappointed me yet.... although nightside is still a bit slow to use."", 'Phone is great. Android is great. Telephoto lense and camera is fantastic!However I still cannot get this to connect to my Kenwood car head unit. Connecting to my Sennheiser headphone took lots of messing about with Developer Options and different Bluetooth settings.  I thought I was safer with an older 6 Pro, however after buying it seems that the BT stack issues are well known online and still unresolved 18 months after release, which you might not pick up from reviews.', ""I have been dealing with dropped calls for years and really thought it was the cell phone provider and area in which I lived. No!!! IT WAS THE PHONE!!!  I returned on my last phone which was the Samsung s21 and decided to get the Google Pixel this time. OMG!!! NO DROPPED CALLS!!!!! The phone quality is great! The picture quality is beautiful!! I'm still getting used to all of the new ways of going about doing things on this phone, but I don't think I'll be using anything other than Google Pixel for decades to come. I used to be a Samsung girl, but I had to put that down. If you're wondering, what would be the best phone to get for your parents who are probably a lot like me and not into all the different gadgets, even though this one comes with a lot, and I'm still getting used to them, get them a Google Pixel. It is easy to operate, and they won't be asking you 50 million questions on how to do this and that. This is definitely the phone for everyone and all age ranges.""]"

Los Glyphs pueden decirte quien te escribio, o que app fue la que notifico, utilizando patrones de luces y parpadeos de las mismas. Estas solo parpadean 1 vez.

Es un dispositivo andriod con una capa de personalizacion pura sin muchos, basicamente es la experiencia de un google Pixel. Pero algo que no tiene de los google Pixels es la camara.Cuando te encuentras en la interfaz de la camara podras notar un detalle similiar a los Motorola, es lo primero que me recordo cuando probe la camara por primera vez.Si quieres comprar un celular para ser diferente este es el adecuado pero si quieres una buena camara ve a otro  lado.

Features I have and use on my 6 year old Android phone do not exist on this.-----------Review:Purchased the Samsung Galaxy A53 as a replacement for my worn out 6 year old Oneplus 3.  It was no longer receiving updates, battery had swollen causing screen to raise, and the final OS update was Android 9.The new Samsung model looked like a good replacement and I purchased it as soon as it was released so I could ensure that it received updates for at least the next three years. It is a lot thicker and heavier than my previous phone which I attribute to the bigger battery. The screen is nice and fingerprint reader built into the screen.These are the issues I have that make it unusable for me:1. No Applocker functionality -  I use this feature to fingerprint protect certain apps \ufeff(mail, financial apps, playstore, etc) to keep out prying eyes or prevent installation of software without my knowledge. My old phone has this by default. The device has no applocker feature. There is no point installing a third party applocker app since this feature needs to be part of the Operating System otherwise is easily disabled.2. Secure folder feature: Samsung has a feature called ""Secure Folder"" which supposedly has a similar function to an applocker. It requires having a Samsung account (Why?) The feature allows you to protect certain apps data and files locally in a special folder but is confusing to use. Apps added into the secure folder still exist outside of the secure folder. Its like having two separate copies of the app you can use independently. Note: this still can\'t be used to protect the playstore or samsung store against unauthorised app installs.3. Multiple profiles: Does not have the ability to setup multiple user profiles (like a guest account, or second account). This is a part of default Android and I use it on my old phone. The second profile is for all the apps that I use rarely that don\'t need running continuously in the background collecting information (like shopping apps, voucher apps, robot vacuum app, etc).3. Bloatware - It\'s taken hours of configuring the phone, uninstalling or disabling apps so that Samsung isn\'t slurping data.  The privacy settings are all over the place. Some apps just can\'t be removed or disabled. After disabling and uninstalling all I could, I still don\'t know what information is being collected and where the data is going. A very frustrating experience.4. Setting Permissions. - I believe this change is an Android 12 change. Instead of a slide switch to enable or disable permissions for an app (eg Cam, Mic, Media, Phone, etc), you have to click on each permission name which takes you to a new screen, then you click on the options to disable it, (usually gives you a warning to dismiss), then you touch to go back to previous screen.  Apps like bixby have every permission enabled. Doing this for multiple apps takes a really long time.5. Bixby button - took some googling to work out how to make the power button a ""power button"" and not keep bringing up bixby.6. Finally, I was looking to connect it to my PC to copy files over from my old phone. Surprised to find that it doesn’t seem to allow connecting directly to the PC.  It does not bring up a notification for USB data transfer, it only shows that it’s charging. Searching in settings for ""USB settings"" and there doesn\'t appear to be one. The main reason I use Android is the ability to use it like a hard disk to quickly copy files, music, etc onto the phone without special software. I think there may be some app that needs to be installed, but I got tired trying to work it out.The Operating System and User Interface implementation really let this product down. Stock Android would have been much better.  This phone is a step backwards from my old phone that it\'s meant to replace. You\'d think technology improves over time. The new features added are useless, useful features have been removed, and expected features are not implemented.', ""8gb+256gb option came with the phone, a 25W charger, and white leather phone cover. It was nice to provide the charger, something which is lacking in newer Samsung phones these days.Had the phone for over a week. Seems to be running well without any sudden restart. It's not as fast as S22, but it handles well compared to s9 or S10.Didn't test it's 5G capabilities since current phone plan is still on 4G, but it runs well in SG (common places thus far, since phone is less than a month old).256GB option allows over 200GB of personal data, after accounting for android 11 and Samsung bloatwares.Will update again should the phone have any problem in coming months."", 'Work well. Delivery is faster than expected.', 'Samsung modifications to Android are still clunky:- Samsung\'s own apps such as Calendar and Contacts are very tightly baked in and get in the user\'s way. You can\'t remove the created or synced calendars, for example.- You cannot tell at a glance which notification category has a sound (compared to Android on Pixel, or Lineage OS).- There are two competing battery management systems - built-in Android and ""Device Care"" which don\'t seem to talk to each other.- Only 3 fingerprints can be registered.- There is no way to change the default alarm sound. Samsung removed that option from settings.', 'I was disappointed with the phone. The frame looks and feel cheap .', 'Large capacity battery.', 'Dislike the product as improtant features were removed like 3.5mm jack, simultaneous mounting of SD card and SIM2. More Apps from Google and samsung are forced to install and are not optional. Rear cameras bulges out and looks UGLY. Disappointed with the purchase.']"

Entre todos os custos benefícios e reviews, acabei optando pelo Poco F5.Meu celular anterior era o redmi note 8pro, oque eu já achava BOMZASSO, rodava tudo, agora imaginem essa maquina aquiQuando ele chegou já fui no site oficial da Xiaomi e pesquisei o produto para ver se era original, e sim ele é, tem todas as informações no site da xiaomi. Ele chegou com 80% de bateria, eu devo ter ficado umas 4 horas configurando ele, e depois eu fui jogar pra vê se realmente era bom ou só falácia, e realmente roda LISO, com um gráifco maravilhoso, o touch dele é muito bom e a pegada também, mas por ter uma câmera muito grande tem que tomar cuidado pra não ficar passando o dedo e e mão. Falando em câmera, ela apesar de ser grande não é das melhores, falaram que não era boa, mas eu não imaginei que era tão ruim. Baixei a Gcam pra vê se ajudava e ajudou um pouco, mas se você quer um celular com uma câmera BOA, esse não é o celular. Eu peguei já sabendo desse contra dele, mas mesmo assim peguei por conta da configuração. Fiquei jogando com ele por horas e falaram que ele esquentava pra caramba, e eu não senti nada disso, muito pelo contrário, não chegou a esquentar em nenhum momento. Quando ficou em 20% eu coloquei pra carregar (até chegar nos 20% deve ter demorando umas 9 horas), em menos de 30min já carregou 100%, é um carregamento muito rápido.A minha visão geral foi: O celular é relmente muito bom, muito rápido, tem uma ótima pegada na mão, o toque na tela é bem gostosa, as câmera apesar de MUITO grande não são boas, a bateria é muito boa, se você não é muito de jogar e quer usar mais pro dia a dia mesmo, com toda certeza vai durar ai 1 dia e meio na sua mão, fora que em 30 Minutos você esta com uma bateria em 100%O meu antigo celular comprei logo que lançou e fiquei com ele por 3 anos. Esse aqui se eu não for furtada antes ficarei mais 3 ou se não até mais.Vendendor é super atencioso, a previsão de entrega era pra o dia 19/25, e chegou dia 19. Fiz o pedido dia 13, ou seja, chegou mega rápido, sempre que eu pergutava algo ele respondia o mais rápido possível.Referente a Nota fiscal, ele manda assim que o aparelho chega, ele manda em PDF.É isso, se estão pensando em comprar essa maquina aqui, comprem sem medo', 'Tenho 10 dias com o aparelho e até o presente momento não tenho do q reclamar, bateria dura muito, tela é responsiva, ótimo desempenho.

A única coisa q não gostei foi relaciona a entrega, paguei expresso e foi postado como comum, não gostei e segundo o vendedor é política da Amazon.Mas do aparelho nada a reclamar!', 'O celular é maravilhoso peguei em um preço ótimo, a entrega foi a melhor que já vi. O vendedor postou no dia seguinte ao pagamento e 23 horas depois de postado chegou na minha casa, sim, em outro estado a entrega demorou 23 horas para chegar à minha mão estava previsto para o dia 15 chegou no dia 6 tudo ótimo nessa compra.

Parfait pour rooter et être libre"", 'Déjà possesseur d\'un Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 qui me donnait entière satisfaction mais qui n\'est désormais plus tenu à jour par Xiaomi, j\'ai voulu le remplacer par un modèle plus récent du fabricant. Bien mal m\'en a pris !Certes, ce Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 Pro 5g est plus véloce que mon ancien téléphone, l\'affichage 120 Hz offre plus de fluidité, et l\'autonomie de sa batterie est toujours excellente, mais il souffre de nombreux problèmes qui rendent son usage pénible voire totalement impropre à mon utilisation, à savoir la navigation via Android Auto.Du côté des défauts ""agaçants"" (petit florilège non exhaustif) :- comme beaucoup de téléphones récents, il ne dispose plus d\'une petite LED clignotante vous indiquant de la présence d\'un message ou d\'un mail lorsque l\'écran est éteint ; l\'écran s\'allume  juste brièvement lorsqu\'une notification arrive mais encore faut-il être devant son téléphone à ce moment précis (vous êtes donc obligé de le rallumer régulièrement pour voir s\'il y a une notification en attente...) ;- le capteur d\'empreinte placé sur la tranche, dans le bouton d\'allumage/extinction, est très petit et s\'avère peu précis et beaucoup moins fiable que celui de mon ancien Redmi Note 7 (plus gros et placé au dos) ; les empreintes digitales sont souvent mal reconnues et lorsqu\'elles sont finalement détectées le téléphone réagit plus lentement qu\'avec mon Redmi Note 7 ; ce système biométrique censé rendre plus fluide l\'utilisation du téléphone s\'avère en réalité lent et laborieux ;- la reconnaissance faciale quant à elle semble assez aléatoire (surtout si vous portez des lunettes) et ne permet pas d\'éviter d\'avoir à ""toucher"" le capteur d\'empreinte asthmatique du téléphone pour le ranimer ;- cerise sur le pompon : même lorsque le son du téléphone est coupé ou qu\'il est en mode ""silence"" ou ""ne pas déranger"", il est impossible de couper le son de certaines publicités (dans les applications, les jeux, etc.) ni de réduire leur volume qui reste au maximum (super génial dans une salle d\'attente ou dans les transports en commun !!!) ; sur mon ancien Redmi Note 7, ainsi que sur d\'autres périphériques Android, on peut toujours couper le sifflet d\'une pub en cliquant sur l\'icone haute parleur de la pub, pas sur ce Redmi Note 11 Pro (ça ne marche tout simplement pas)...Mais là où le téléphone s\'est révélé totalement défaillant c\'est avec Android Auto. Celui-ci plante systématiquement au bout de 15-30 mn au maximum, et ensuite il est impossible de le refaire fonctionner même après avoir rebooté le téléphone (compliqué et dangereux à faire en conduisant faut-il le souligner !). Je précise que je n\'utilise que des cordons USB courts et certifiés ""SuperSpeed"" (qui fonctionnent parfaitement sous Android Auto avec mon ancien Redmi Note 7) donc le problème ne provient pas de là. Après des semaines d\'essais divers, à tenter de désinstaller/réinstaller, mettre à jour et/ou bidouiller les applications et packages logiciels incriminés, rien n\'y a fait. Cela fait penser à un bug cité sur la toile sur certains appareils Android où Android Auto plante dès que la batterie atteint 100% de charge (ce qui finit forcément pas arriver puisque le téléphone est branché en USB à la voiture).Le SAV de Xiaomi que j\'ai finalement contacté a finalement reconnu que le problème provient de l\'actuel système d\'exploitation MIUI du téléphone qui n\'est pas encore au point... mais sans fournir de date de résolution de ce problème ni s\'il sera jamais solutionné. Je me retrouve donc avec un téléphone flambant neuf mais totalement inutilisable pour Android Auto alors que c\'était la motivation principale de mon achat. Comble de malheur, avec ces semaines d\'essais à tenter de résoudre le problème, j\'ai laissé passer le délai pour retourner le produit et me le faire rembourser. Le vendeur me propose seulement de le renvoyer en garantie au fabricant et de le me renvoyer après ""réparation""... ce qui ne résoudra rien car le produit n\'est pas ""cassé"" il est juste mal conçu et est équipé d\'un système d\'exploitation buggé...En tout cas, si vous cherchez un téléphone pour l\'utiliser sous Android Auto, passez votre chemin, je ne saurais en aucun cas vous recommander ce Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 Pro 5g.', 'Das handy ist schnel ist schön und hat eine gute camera', ""Il telefono è molto buono e soddisfacente, ne avevo già uno uguale e l'ho preso per regalarlo.

‎PASE0019US,Moto G Power | 2022 | 3-Day Battery | Unlocked | Made for US by Motorola | 4/128GB | 50 MP Camera | Ice Blue,Smartphones,S$344.74,https://www.amazon.sg/Power-Battery-Unlocked-Motorola-Camera/dp/B09SM6GR4B/ref=sr_1_44?qid=1695968220&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051%2Cp_72%3A6469119051%2Cp_36%3A20000-150000&rnid=6450031051&s=electronics&sr=1-44,https://www.amazon.sg/Power-Battery-Unlocked-Motorola-Camera/product-reviews/B09SM6GR4B/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,4.3,"['Nice', 'This is my second ""g power"".  I will admit this seems like motorola has gone backwards from the 2020 g power, but actually I don\'t see a big difference in performance or any noticeable drop or lag.  It\'s basically the same phone as the other prior models in the g power line that only the most stubborn geek would care to notice.  For the price, you really can\'t get a better phone.  Due to my work environment, I am very very hard on phones.  and every year or so, I get a new one  in this line of motorola phones, because I cannot afford to be without a phone even for couple of days awaiting a replacement if my old phone bites the dust.  My only complaint is that motorola has not designed a easy method for transferring google messages from the old phone to the new phone. This is something that samsung has done for years and apple too and several other phones.  So there are some additional steps you have to take to transfer messages and other data (like calendar and alarm, and even your own custom home background), from the old phone to the new.  Some of this is due to google not designing the android ecosystem as robustly as it needs to be, but there are methods and even some apps that make transfering of data between phones possible.  last comment:  I searched several tech sites about motorola ""think shield"".  It\'s apparently a type of secure bootloader similar to samsung knox, but to be honest, the lack of transparency from motorola on this new tech is a head scratcher.  One is left wondering why motorola has chosen to not publish the complete open source code to review so that a level of confidence and trust can be established.  I might be paranoid, but I am old enough and have the experience and background to realize that when ANY tech company refuses to share important details about ""security"", there is likely some monkey business happening they don\'t want anyone to know about.  Does this mean I will not buy motorola?  Obviously not, but lets be clear.  think shield did not exist on the g power 2020 model.  And I never had and I know no one who has ever had a hack of their 2020 g power moto phones either!  So that raises the question of why?  It\'s an interesting question.  I would hope that motorola would be more open about this and share how this technology is used and what kind of data they do collect from it, and if they share this private data or not.  That IS an important question, even if motorola is not doing something particularly harmful.  what is potentially harmful is that any data collected from this new tech might be subject of interests from hackers and criminals.  So we would want to know exactly how motorola is collecting this data and how they are protecting it from unwanted snooping and criminal and of course central governments who have increased a broad range of lawful and unlawful surveillance.  Final:  I like the phone.  the build quality is good and seems just as durable as the old 2020 g power model.  I could have bought another 2020 ""new"" model again, but the 2020 model would not upgrade to android 12 (consumer cellular/att), and any saving in cost was really only about 30 bucks. I don\'t regret buying this new model, but I was somewhat surprised that motorola and amazon do not advertise or even mention the think shield security.  That does raise some red flags.  I also am not pleased with how motorola pushes/nags with the line of apps I  do not want.  One of the selling points with motorola is that it is nearly identical to stock vanilla android.  That seems to have changed and now motorola seems to have developed their new models to push crapware.  I don\'t need tick tock.  I don\'t need and don\'t want that nag ware constantly reminding me to install it as a ""recommendation"" from motorola.  The only workaround I have found to stop the endless nagware is to actually agree to install the entire ensemble of crapware.  Then delete all the data and the uninstall the apps they recommend.  So far, that is the only workaround.  So much for ""almost stock android""!', 'I bought this phone as a replacement for my wife\'s Samsung S8, after the battery expanded and shattered the screen. I had this Moto G Power (2022) on my ""saved for later"" list for myself, since I anticipate my S9+\'s battery to someday expand eventually (last three Samsungs have done so ), but as it was Prime Day, I bought the Motorola phone for her (I put it back on my list for me, too, just in case my S9+ bites the dust).I like the size & weight of the G power, so does the wife...it feels more durable than the more expensive Samsungs we previously had (have). We\'ll see how long it lasts, though without wireless QI charging, I expect it to outlive the flagship Samsungs we\'d been using.', ""I own 4 of these phones and they are all great.  No problems with any of them.  The battery lasts forever even when in use.  They don't seem to lag or have any problems.  Memory size is great and yeah... Pretty decent phone.  At first I was worried because I went to a more ghetto Verizon store and the guy there didn't know how to get it to register in the Verizon system.  I went to the better and more popular Verizon store and they had no problems at all activating them.  The price is right and the quality is right.  No complaints.  Just buy it (and don't take it to the ghetto locations)!"", 'Photo quality not great.  Apple photo quality is the best so far.  Wifi signal/reception better and stronger than Apple.', ""This is my 3rd. G Power and it works the best. I've always had connectivity issues with the 2020 and 2021 models. Had to restart the phone often to connect to devices. So far, that's fixed in the 2022 version, hopefully it continues. My Google home cameras also work as they should. The cameras open as soon as the app is opened. Previously, I would have to open and close the app multiple times for the cameras to work. Overall, it is a bit more laggy opening and closing apps. I can deal with that as long as they work when opened. These are good affordable phones when using your own using your own carrier."", 'i dont play games on it so i dont know how well it would work with that but i do watch youtube on it and it works fine, does everything i need it to do, battery life is great. no problems so far, been about 3 months and its still working great', ""If you are looking for a blazing fast phone, this is not the phone for you.  It can be kind of sluggish loading websites and apps, but it is still usable.  The camera is not the best quality either, only 1080p, which is pretty outdated for a 2022 phone. However, this is a decent phone for basic use, if you don't need anything other than to make phone calls, text and look up things, I would recommend this one."", ""Motorola stopped providing updates, including security updates, for my 2020 Moto G Power, so I felt obligated to replace it.  This one, 128 GB in Ice Blue, actually cost less than what I paid for the 2020 model, which had less storage.Numerous junk apps like TikTok came pre-installed on this phone, but I was able to uninstall them and they seem to stay off (be sure to fully update phone *before* uninstalling/disabling, else they might return).  I also disabled a lot of needless Google apps that can't be removed.  Now that the extensive clean-up has been done, I now have a decent phone much like the 2020 Power G I had before -- simple and clean, works well with Visible (my cellular provider).Cons:1) The dumb two-line clock on the lock screen can be changed -- on Android 12L. However, this phone only has Android 12, so we're stuck with that gaudy 2-line lock screen clock.  Fortunately we can choose a sensible clock for the home screen.2) The OS is a little slower to respond than my 2020 Power G, due to the slower chip (yes, incredibly, this phone has a slower chip than the 2020 model...maybe that is why this newer model was cheaper).3) Had to uninstall / disable a LOT of junk.Pros:1) Color (ice blue is a nice change from my old glossy black one)2) I'm getting security updates again...for awhile, until Motorola decides to stop providing them for this model too.3) Relatively inexpensive.4) Battery life is still good, like the prior model.5) A little thinner than the older model."", 'No one knows what color it is after i put on a case. No NFC and it keeps your wallet safe. Huge battery capacity is a plus.']"

Although the phone will recognize a T-Mobile SIM card and ""might"" work on the T-Mobile network, if you are a former Sprint customer, then you are SOL and they will refuse to activate the phone based on the IMEI.  I visited 3 T-Mobile stores (2 corporate and 1 independent) and spent probably 7 hours on the phone trying to activate this phone on my former Sprint account with no success.  No one could tell me why it won\'t work or isn\'t supported on their network.  I got the feeling everyone I talked to didn\'t care and only wanted to sell me something they stock and switch my plan so they could earn a commission.  The most likely reason (and I take this with a block of salt) given by their tech support is that due to the recent transition/merger of the Sprint and T-Mobile networks, there may be frequency bands that are no longer active but were supported when the phone was initially released only a year ago.  I really wanted to love this phone but I could never really try it out and it seems to be a losing battle to get thru to anyone at T-Mobile who is willing to dig in to the issue for a resolution.', 'Hasta ahora, había quebrado todos mis celulares.

Because of that, I had to return the case I bought for a Pixel 5 and obtain a new Pixel 4a case--which fits perfectly."", 'Great phone.  Really enjoying my first week with it.PROS:All the pros are fairly well documented online so I won\'t dwell too much on them. Loving the 90hz refresh, the comfortable size, the small bezels, the 5G, the pure Android experience, the fast wireless charging, the super quick fingerprint scanner, and the excellent battery life.NON-ISSUES (FOR ME):I had a few concerns going in which turned out to be non-issues for me:1) Gap between screen and body: There were many reports online of an inconsistent gap between the screen and aluminum body of the phone, with an especially large gap near the corner with the camera.  Maybe I got lucky, but did not have this issue.  There\'s a VERY small gap on my phone, but it\'s consistent all the way around, appears to be by design, and doesn\'t bother me at all.2) Speakers: I\'m coming from a Pixel 2 which has stereo front firing speakers.  While I do notice the lack of stereo sound on the Pixel 5, I found the overall volume and clarity of the Pixel 5 to be better actually.  Does it compete with the best phones out there in terms of sound?  Probably not.  But for my purposes it is more than adequate.  I also found the behind-screen speaker for phone calls to be fine.  It\'s a little weird for the whole phone to vibrate when someone\'s talking, but I\'ve already gotten used to it.3) Old camera hardware: Coming from a Pixel 2 which takes good photos, the Pixel 5 is incrementally better.  It\'s not going to compete with an iPhone 12 Pro in all departments, but it\'s still good even though the main camera hardware is a couple years old.  Wide-angle is nice to have.4) Midrange processor: I really haven\'t noticed this being an issue yet.  Granted, I don\'t do a ton of photo processing or gaming on the phone.  But for everyday tasks it\'s totally fine.  Definitely faster and snappier than my Pixel 2, and the 90hz makes it all look buttery smooth.5) Lack of squeeze-for-assistant: I\'m already getting used to swiping up from the corner.  Not really missing this feature as much as I thought I would.MINOR CONS:1) The bio-resin on edges near the screen seems a little rough, and the cutout for the USB-C port could have been rounded a bit so the edge wasn\'t so ""sharp"".  Neither seem like defects, but I used to use my pinky as a ledge to sit the phone on, and now that\'s a little uncomfortable.  Just an adjustment I\'ll need to make.  I don\'t use a case, so if you\'re planning on using one this issue will be moot for you.2) Screen viewing angle seems slightly narrow.  In normal use this is not an issue, but it it\'s not quite as good as an iPhone XS or 11.3) No telephoto.  I\'ve never had one so I don\'t know what I\'m missing.  I think I have more use for wide-angle so it\'s an ok tradeoff for me, but it would have been nice to have telephoto too.  If you have a Pixel 4 and use the telephoto a lot, this might not be the upgrade path for you.4) This is more of an Android 11/app developer issue, but a lot of apps, including some Google apps like Chrome, don\'t do a good job of showing off the small uniform bezels on the Pixel 5.  You still end up with black bars at the top and bottom in most cases behind the notification area at the top and the gesture line at the bottom.  They should really be transparent, especially at the bottom.  Maybe that\'ll improve with time, but it\'s hard to actually appreciate the nice bezels on the phone on anything but the home screen.All in all, this is a 5-star phone for me.  Looks great, and it\'s well rounded.  Recommended.', 'El producto cumple la función descrita, no deja de ser un producto de Google, con actualizaciones y seguridad al día. Android puro.', ""I love this phone because it works extremely well and especially because it's the last of almost any phone to have the fingerprint sensor on the back!  the fingerprint sensor reads instantly and unlocks instantly when I stick my hand in my pocket it naturally cups the phone and very naturally puts my finger right on the fingerprint sensor thereby opening my phone before I even have it out of my pocket!  I'm going to cry when this phone dies..."", 'I purchased the Google Pixel 5 5G 128GB in ""Just Black"" with high hopes, mainly for its reputed camera quality. Coming from a Pixel 6, I was looking for a smaller phone without compromising on camera capabilities. However, my experience with this phone turned out to be a mix of both positive and negative aspects.Camera Quality:True to its Pixel lineage, the camera on the Pixel 5 is outstanding. It captures stunning photos with great detail and color accuracy. Low-light performance is particularly impressive. If camera quality is your top priority, you won\'t be disappointed.Display Issues:Unfortunately, my excitement was short-lived. As soon as I unboxed the phone, I noticed a dim effect on the display. It was disappointing to see this issue right out of the box, and it detracted from the overall experience.Country Lock Problem:The most significant setback came when I tried to use my Indian SIM card in the phone, only to discover that the device was country-locked to Canada. This meant I couldn\'t use it with my Indian carrier, which was a major inconvenience. This is something I wish had been clearly stated before purchase, as it significantly limits the phone\'s usability for international users.Amazon\'s Customer Service:On a positive note, Amazon\'s customer service was exceptional in addressing the issue. They were responsive, helpful, and initiated a smooth return process. They also provided guidance on potential solutions, even though the country lock issue was beyond their control.In summary, the Google Pixel 5 5G offers a fantastic camera experience but falls short in other areas. The display issue and country lock problem were major disappointments, especially for international users. However, Amazon\'s excellent customer service saved the day by promptly addressing the issue and providing a full refund. If you\'re considering purchasing this phone, be sure to check its compatibility with your region\'s carriers before making a decision.', 'I wanted a smaller phone  and one with good battery life. This phone fits the bill. Most phones today are much larger and no easy to carry on your pocket. This one fits just right and has many good features. I would recommend this phone if you want a smaller one.', ""I'm reluctant to pay this much for a smartphone as they're pretty much a consumable these days.  That said, the Pixel 5 is a fantastic phone.  Clean, vanilla Android, snappy performance, beautiful pictures and battery for days sum it up.  The cell and WiFi radios outperform my Essential phone by a country mile. I can make phone calls on Verizon from my house, something the last three phones were not able to do reliably.  It will stay connected to our spotty WiFi better than any other phone or tablet I've owned.  The pictures are nicely exposed and vibrant in any but the poorest conditions.  It's a great size and weight for a smartphone.  The screen looks rich and smooth as silk, but not oversaturated.  The fingerprint sensor isn't as reliable as I'd like, and that it's surface looks like the texture on the rest of the back of the phone means that you can't glance at it to see if it's clean.  And if it's to work, it needs to be really, really clean.  The fit and finish is nice, and I didn't get an example with the half installed screen.  I like the texture that's been applied to the body, even if it reminds me of Plastidip.  The phone feels solid, but not overly weighty.  It's sits in a jeans pocket nicely.  Sits nicely in the hand, too.  Just enough weight.  Just enough.  The GPS receiver appears to be quite a bit more sensitive than any previous phone of mine.  It locks in on location fast, and in many places others never see the satellites.  Wireless charging is, well, nice, if not the ultimate experience.  Most of that is not an reflection of the phone.  It's nice to be able to just lay the phone on a charger for the night.  Small, round chargers, however, leave the phone vulnerable to being knocked off the nightstand.  I switched to one that's a rounded rectangle, similar in size to the phone.  Happiness.  And, it's easier to get the phone placed relative to the charger's coil so that it will charge.  Wireless charging is slow, of course, but the Pixel 5 will charge from 15% to full overnight.  Speaking of charging, the Pixel 5 is relatively slow to charge when plugged into USB-C, but not to the point of being a real problem.  Just don't expect to throw 50% charge on it while you're in the shower.  I'm still learning the camera app, but it's more than good enough from what I've seen so far.  Portrait Light would be useful on any subject, but Google only shows the control if they think the subject is human.  Yes, some of us take pictures of cats, too, and that lighting magic would be nice to have.  Maybe it will develop enough over time to be used in any picture.So, all in all, the Pixel 5 is a significant upgrade, and an outstanding smartphone experience.  I do recommend."", ""I have been using my Pixel 5 for two weeks and love it. Google has a lot of promise when it comes to creating a compelling phone that feels well integrated from a hardware and software perspective similar to what Apple does with the iPhone.I got the iPhone 12 Pro before I got the Pixel 5 and ended up returning the iPhone because the software experience still leaves a lot to be desired for heavy Google services users and people who want any customization freedom whatsoever. I was considering giving up Google services in favor of the stuff that come preinstalled on iOS and my Macs but the reality is that Apple's alternatives don't come anywhere close.The Good- The software experience is incredible.- The size is perfect. Compact but not too small.- The camera is stellar.- I love the screen.- Very smooth despite all the noise about it having a mid-tier chipset. 90hz refresh rate really helps make things feel fluid.- Battery life is the best i've had on a phone period (I have been able to make it last 2 days with moderate usage).- Thank god it is ip68 certified. Is especially useful since I wash my phone off daily after the gym due to covid.The Bad- The speakers are very mediocre.- Haptics are average.- The Android 11 gesture system could use a lot of improvement. The new back gestures break things like hamburger menu swipes and Spotify album cover song swiping. iOS has gesture based navigation way more dialed in. Google should literally just copy what they have. Right now back gestures just feel like an emulated hardware back button key press from Android phones of yesteryear.- I have experience a decent amount of screen mispresses due to the fact that the display bezels are so small. I can't stress how annoying this is. This happens mostly when I am laying down and have my pointer finger anchored on the top right of the phone while using my thumb for tapping the screen. This is a usability hinderance I hope they improve the software so that it filters unwanted touches. Apple is smart about this in iOS and has certain drag thresholds for things like opening the control center. I wish Google would do similar things so that something as small as an accidental nip of the top of the screen doesn't cause the notification shade to pop completely open.- My 2 pairs of AirPod Pros both have major bluetooth issues with this phone. I almost always have to re-pair (sometimes even more than once) since the volume control on the phone does all sorts of wonky stuff on initial pair. The AirPods work fine on all my other devices.Hopefully Google decides to continue improve the software. I would still highly recommend this phone even in its current state. Coming from somebody who is very picky this phone is the clear winner for me between the iPhone 12 Pro and OnePlus 8T.Well done Google!""]"

All these wires are tested to be working on other electronic devices.', '[May 7, 2021 thoughts on Pixel 4a, ordered November 8, 2020 and used daily ever since]PROS:Form factor and weight-This is the best marriage I have found. Fantastic screen real estate, sensible (ideal?) resolution, and just terrific dimensions for me. This thing is light weight for its size, and I love that more than I can possibly express. Hand fatigue has been all but completely eliminated. Give me plastics, baby! I have no desire for metals that don\'t add to functionality (and apparently, from something I saw on YouTube, this phone is insanely rugged, even with a plastic shell). Glass is always heavier and less durable than other materials choices, and it\'s just altogether not well suited for the backside of a mobile handset, IMO. I think Apple charges $550 to replace the back glass on most modern iPhones. This Pixel 4a is the total package and stickers for $200 less than the price of Apple\'s back glass repair.Price:Performance-While I can\'t compare this phone to another of its kind with a higher performing Qualcomm, I am never wanting for speed. This phone has been wonderfully fluid and performant for my day-to-day needs. The lean Android experience on the Pixel line really lets its mid-range Qualcomm shine. I most recently carried both an iPhone 7 Plus and 2020 SE, and both proved plenty fast for anything I do; this 4a is no exception.Background app refreshes seem to be on par with what I had using 3GB iPhones. No real surprises. My day-to-day habits seem mostly unaffected by any background app refreshes I\'ve noticed. I think the 6GB of memory strikes a good balance for the 4a.I don\'t game. Well, I play some chess now and again, including occasional analysis using very demanding engines (Stockfish, etc), but in general I can\'t comment on gaming performance.Battery-Battery life and charging time have been lovely. I seldom charge to 100-percent, instead I prefer to just give little 5- to 15-minute charges periodically during the day, while keeping the battery in the 30- to 70-percent range where possible. This thing charges way, way faster than my older 7 Plus and 2020 SE iPhones and overall battery life is likely comparable or better from what I can gather (very unscientifically). I leave it to the readers to determine how important battery life is and do some research of their own.Camera-It\'s so good it doesn\'t even make sense. Shooting stills, the 4a smashes my old iPhone 7 Plus my a wide margin and the 2020 SE couldn\'t hold a candle either. I think that\'s being objective. I\'ve had quite a bit of low-level, professional photography training at University level and time behind the lens of DSLRs, and I\'m quite astonishing that I can get such quality images from the 4a. The software image processing is pure magic.I have kids, and they\'re the important subjects for me. I\'d guessed the 4a might struggle with motion, particularly in lower light, which would have been a deal-breaker for me, but this thing takes ""keepers"" practically every single time. Glorious. Most already know how well Pixel phones shoot non-moving subjects, so I won\'t carry on about that. It\'s an exciting camera experience. Concerning video, the 1080p 30- and 60-frame shooting has not disappointed either, and the image stabilization is truly excellent. I don\'t mess with 4k on phones (yet), so no comment there. I don\'t take selfies, so I won\'t comment on the front-facing camera either.Android-The gesture navigation is fantastic, particularly the ability to go back by swiping in from either the left- or right-hand side of the display. Massively convenient and easy on the hands.Updates/security patches are crucial for me, and with a Pixel, scorching fast updates are what you get, and support duration bests most Android-based OEMs.Fingerprint recognition-Works as well and as fast as any I\'ve experienced. Thought the rear placement would bug me. It absolutely does not. Rear placement is probably my preference now. Well executed. I like.CONS:Audio volume/intensity-The 4a just doesn\'t get as loud as some other modern handsets. It\'s tricky to listen to a podcast or whatever when I\'m doing dishes, for example. That said, the audio quality is perfectly satisfactory, to me.Google Search-There\'s a Google search bar installed by default on the home screen. I leave mine there and find it useful. When tapped, you\'re presented with the ability to ""search apps, web, and more..."" (much like the search on iOS when you pull down from the top). Google/Android learns over time, so that eventually it can quickly present you with what you\'re most likely to want. Works great, more often than not. But the problem for me is that it\'s inconsistent with regards to displaying apps. It must be that about 20-percent of the time it doesn\'t display apps, so I\'m forced to swipe up from the bottom of the display to close the interface, then tap the Google search bar again before it populates apps in the query. I can\'t figure out what causes this for the life of me, and I\'ve owned an IT MSP for years, so this ain\'t my first rodeo with tech devices! Frustrating, but muscle memory makes this only a half-second affair to correct.Dependability-I\'ve long used the same MVNO for cell service, which I mention only because there exists a small possibility that it\'s of importance here: I\'ve found a few occasions where I can\'t place phone calls. To fix, for some reason, a reboot was required. I haven\'t had any issues in the past few months, but it\'s probably because I\'ve changed habits; now, whenever there\'s an update to something low-level from Android (not just a basic app update), I reboot the phone. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?? Anyway, I\'d have a ""need"" to reboot an iPhone maybe once every six months, outside of forced reboots from doing an iOS update. To have had to monthly (or maybe even more frequently) reboot this 4a in order to connect phone calls (with no warning as to any trouble, unless I attempted to place a call and ""connect the dots"") is unfortunate. I don\'t like to have to think about mitigating critically buggy behavior by rebooting my phone from time to time.OLED-I\'m sensitive to flicker, so I basically hate OLED. My daily driver laptop is a ThinkPad T480s LARGELY because its 1080p IPS is flicker-free (no PWM). This 4a gives me viewing fatigue after a relatively short while. On the 4a, unless you\'re at max brightness (exactly 100-percent), you can expect flicker in the ~122 to 255Hz range. That\'s too low for me. I would prefer an LCD, like the ones I had in my iPhone 7 Plus or 2020 SE. I could view those endlessly without fatigue- read books on them, you name it. But the industry does trend, and trend it does for the contrast ratio specs and inky blacks the kids rave about these days {rolls eyes}.Overall:This is probably the finest overall set of compromises I\'ve ever found in a cell phone, and I\'ve owned many of them since 1994. I\'m highly satisfied with this handset, and I think very little could realistically be done today to improve upon the formula that is the Pixel 4a. Google has made a proper phone for adults.9/10 DO recommend!', ""So I have had zero issues with the fingerprint reader. It is actually been really good for letting me in and nobody else in. I even put a case on mine and I can still reach the finger reader so I actually think it's really great it's much easier for me to get into my phone compared to my old one. What I like about this phone too is that it is thinner. I used to have the Moto x charge and that was definitely much wider and I didn't realize how much more uncomfortable it is. Now when I pick that one up to try and compare to this one it's such a beast in such a tank. Whereas this new phone it's thinner and slimmer and can actually like fit in my palm so it's in my hand and then it can sit nicely on my finger like if I'm holding it like cut. Which is very nice and I can reach everything on it with my thumb. The fact that the screen is the entire phone face is still giving me the exact same size as my old phone just I no longer have a big phone because it didn't take up the whole screen it had sides on it before so I really like that this one is the whole screen and that it's slimmer. I have a nice case on it and I have a screen protector on the front and I'm still able to use everything the same and everything is functioning fine. My only thing is yes the battery does last all day, my old phone my battery could last a couple days but it was an ex-charge and the battery was supposed to do that. But the bonus about this phone here is it does tell me if I keep continuing using it at the rate that I am it tells me about when my phone will die the estimated die time for the battery. So that's easy for me to be like oh okay well I'm going to be going and doing this so maybe I should charge it now. But I typically only charge it at night when I'm going to sleep. it does have a spam detection for calls which I didn't realize was a thing and I've had a couple phone calls like pop up but never ring and then they go away and I am notified that they were spam and then I have verified and they actually are indeed spam. So that has been really nice. I also like that I can give names to my group chats. Everything seems to be running very smoothly and fast at least faster than what I'm used to. it did take a little getting used to for me to do the back button cuz there was no back button I couldn't figure it out but if you just hold off to the side a little bit it is actually much easier to go back and forth between things I've found. my screen now has five icons across compared to my old one that had only four icons across so for me that's fine because I can see them fine I haven't looked to see if I can change that. So if you are maybe hard on seeing that might not be a benefit but otherwise for me since I don't have that problem this is great I really also like that I can just click on the time and date on the phone and it pulls up my calendar or the weather I don't have to go search for a different app I just click on it on my phone and it just takes me to that app.my other favorite thing is that it is still an Android phone I absolutely love the Android app I even have my tablets in Android because I'm just so used to Android and I prefer Android over the counterpart. Like I really dislike Apple and Apple I think is so much more expensive.another fun thing is the night mode I set a bedtime for me and when it's my bedtime if I'm staying up it goes into a black and white scale mode so everything is in black and white so then I go all right fine yep it's bedtime. I also like the do not disturb because I can have things blocked for when I'm sleeping so my phone isn't ringing or anything and I don't have to remember to put it on silent it was automatically does that. Unless of course it's emergency it is set to if somebody calls back within a 10-15 minute window that it will ring because it's a priority call and I have that turned on. I haven't even come close to using all the storage space that I have on my phone. Whereas my old phone I was constantly having to delete things to get a new app if I wanted to and it was very hard to do, so I like the extra space I like how fast it works and I like the thinness of it actually. As for phone calls and stuff I don't have an issue with the speaker or the earpiece very simple to use and my camera is still working nicely I I still get really nice pictures.this one does say that it's for all carriers and I have Xfinity mobile, and when I got the phone I checked the number against their oh is your phone compatible on the website and it wasn't. I was very frustrated I even set up to start a new return with this but then, I was on with the people on chat and I was trying to figure it out and I even said I was going to try and go somewhere else. But here's the thing even though that they wouldn't help me and they kind of have some sucky customer service. I have a very cheap bill with them I just have to have my cable with them to get them and then each month it's just I think it's like $12 per gigabyte of data that you use and since I don't use data I don't have a bill each month because my phone is paid off I have nothing else going on there so I have a really great deal with them so I want to keep with them so. So before I decided to actually ship it back I pulled my chip card out of my old phone and slid it into this one here and eureka! My phone actually works really well I didn't have to change anything with my carrier all I had to do was change my SIM card and the phone is compatible even if they tell you it's not compatible So I would say give that a try if you do have Xfinity, and then if it works great if not I'm sorry you'll have to look for something else considering the stage shouldn't work but mine works and I've been doing it for two months now and haven't had any disruptions with my service everything has been great and I haven't had to change my billing at all so I have really enjoyed having this phone.I hope my review has been helpful. If it has been helpful, please hit the helpful button."", 'I procure and customize Android devices, specifically Google, as a little side source of income for myself.  Needless to say I am surrounded by a ton of phones and about 95% of them I do not like.I gravitate toward pure Google phones because one can tweak them and make them function and operate and perform to the specific individuals needs.I have had every Google phone from the original Pixel right through the 5.  This review is about the 4a so I won\'t elaborate on why I dislike models past the 5.  I will only say that they\'re just too darn BIG.I found this phone on Amazon being sold as ""used, like new"" from Amazon stock and I already knew that if it\'s coming directly from Amazon stock that it\'s not going to be some discarded vendor phone with a attachment of a service provider or bloatware, etc. (because Amazon is careful the screen what they sell from their own stock because they stand behind it 100% 😁).Even though I have a whole bunch of phones from which to choose, I use a Pixel 4a5g as my primary phone but it started to feel a little bit too large for me and holding it just hurt my hand for lack of better description.  I don\'t like large phones.  I always keep two primary phones and my secondary phone, that I had for almost 6 years, finally gave up so I was in the market to replace it.I wanted something smaller than the 4a5g, which I do continue to use.  Google\'s phones just keep getting bigger so I sought out what might still be available with Android updates, has a decent battery life, and is small and appealing and I found the 4a.  I ADORE IT!I could probably write a book about all the reasons that you should buy this phone but it would take a zillion years to do so and certainly blow up Amazon\'s servers SO I will synopsize.✓ It is a nice, pleasant to hold size and is very suitable and comfortable to hold for extended periods of time while texting or viewing websites or videos;✓ right out of the box you will be able to update to Android 13 and receive updates, I believe for the next 3 years;✓ it does not come with a bunch of bloatware which people usually try to get rid of by rooting their phones and therefore destroying warranty and usually screwing up their phones.  Right out of the box you can customize it to perform to your personal satisfaction;✓ battery life is absolutely fantastic!  On paper the battery doesn\'t look like it would be so great but, au contraire, I\'ve been texting and looking at YouTube videos and shopping online since 8:30 this morning (it\'s 3:19 right now so that\'s almost 8 hours) and my battery is still at 86% 😮!  EXCELLENT!;✓ it does not come with wireless charging built in but you can purchase a wireless adapter (get ""short"" if you don\'t want the finger print unlock covered up) for about $15 and the charging world is beautiful;✓ unlike most of the newer phones, this one came with the charger, c cord, as well as the adapter so you can zap the contents of your existing phone right smack over to your new 4a before you get done deciding on what to make for dinner;✓ phone is very responsive and does not start lagging even with multiple websites, facebook, and Amazon shopping open and active;✓ screen resolution is exceptional and does NOT force dark mode as many of the current models do;✓ easily accessible full developer mode allows you to tweak the settings so that the phone performs and looks the way YOU want it to;✓ has fingerprint unlock as well as custom bezel configuration;✓ cutout can be easily hidden for those that find it annoying as I do (on other brands of phones you\'re stuck with the thing 😡);✓ camera quality is absolutely excellent for both stills and videos as well as wide and landscape modes.  For those desiring a camera camera camera type of mode, I usually install ""open camera"" for my clients.  It allows you to tweak the heck out of everything and make the phone perform as a camera... There is absolutely no need to spend ridiculous amounts of money to get one of those phones that boasts about their camera... just install that app and I can\'t imagine anything else you could possibly need;I quite literally could go on for pages about what I love about this phone but it would take forever.  I cannot find any flaws about it at all.  I\'m absolutely thrilled to have a phone that is a comfortable size and performs as I want it to.The only drawback that might even be something to be thought of is if you keep your phone for 10 or 12 years is that you are capped at 4G.  BUT if you live in the United States that shouldn\'t be an issue at all for the next decade.  I told you that my phone of 7 years finally died.  It was working beautifully at 3G.  It just got worn out.  I do know a bit about customizing and programming phones and that might be why my lasted so long but with a little bit of care yours should be able to last just as long and don\'t be scared off by the 4G.  It will last WELL into the future.I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase!  If you are in the market for an unlocked fully customizable phone, and you want one that isn\'t as big as a freaking cereal box sitting in front of you, this is the way to go!', 'Fa tutto quel che dice, è velocissimo, bello...peccato solo per la batteria che a seconda dei giorni non arriva neanche a fine giornata 🤷🏽', ""I had the Pixel 4a for a month in late 2020, and I generally liked the phone. The most important part that makes this phone great is the price, $350. It's not going to get you any top-tier iPhone 12 Pro Max or Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, but it gives you everything the general user would possibly need - a decently fast Snapdragon 730G SOC, 6GB RAM, and 128GB storage. That's something that not even the $830 base configuration of iPhone 12 gets you.Of course, being $350 there are a few things that it misses out on compared to higher-tier phones. One of those things would be the plastic unibody build over something like a metal and glass sandwich. On a phone of this price point it's fine, though I did have a bit of plastic creaking near the SIM slot. It was just an annoyance at worst, because the rest of the plastic build felt fine.Wireless charging is also not present, this may disappoint some that used it but it didn't bother me cause I never used wireless charging on my iPhone 8.There's no water resistance either, which did raise my eyebrows a bit before I bought the phone but I don't submerge my phone in water or take it to very dusty places.One thing this does have that the $700 Pixel 5 doesn't have is a headphone jack. So if you still use anything with a 3.5mm plug, this phone has you covered with no need for adapters! The speakers are also quite good, with one speaker on the bottom next to the USB-C port and one built into the earpiece.As for the software, it's got three years of updates which is better than many Android manufactures, but it still won't top Apple's software support. I did notice a few software bugs when I used it, mainly with YouTube Vanced's PIP mode after a certain amount of time. Restarting fixed the issue but it was an annoyance. Hopefully that was just Android 11 and that gets fixed with a future update.Battery life is also pretty decent, better than the aging battery on my iPhone 8 since I could comfortably leave it off the charger for one night. Given that it's a small phone by today's standards it's not going to be a battery life king, but it's better than the $400 iPhone SE.The size is something I loved about this phone, my hands are relatively small and I like my phone to be pocketable, which is something that I'm not a fan of with most new phones being over 6 inches in size. The 5.81-inch edge-to-edge screen Is of a similar size to my iPhone 8 and the iPhone X, thus I could easily use it with one hand and it fit well in my pockets. This is something I'm sure is greatly appreciated by those who also like smaller phones.The camera has been the definition of the Pixel phones since the first ones launched in 2016. This phone has an amazing single 12MP lens, mostly made great by Google's computational photography software. Night mode was very nice to use, as in the scenarios I used it in it helped out take better photos at night. I'm no expert with cameras so I don't know much about white balance, dynamic range, etc. I do like how this phone gives you one great camera as opposed to other manufacturers which give you like seven different pretty-much-useless camera sensors.Overall, this is the phone to buy if you're on a budget of less than $500 and you want something that will fulfill all the general needs. I would suggest going for the Pixel 4a 5G version if you can afford a $500 phone as that has a second ultrawide camera lens, a faster Snapdragon 765G SOC, and as the name says, 5G connectivity. That phone will overall will give you a very very close experience to the Pixel 5, but if you don't have that much to put down for a phone, and if you like the standard 4a's smaller size, this phone is the way to go. I highly recommend it and I would personally pick this any day of the week over a similarly priced phone from a China brand like Oppo, Xiaomi, ZTE, Vivo, etc."", 'La verdad me encantó este teléfono, desde el hardware hasta el software son una cosa mágica aparte ya llevo desde el 2020 y sigue muy fluido como si fuera nuevo', 'Good product, was working well. But stopped working in warranty period, Amazon customer service is great and resolved the concern', 'I\'m coming from a samsung android note 9. Loved my note 9 but turns out I\'m not that good with big bulky all glass expensive phones... Who woulda thought🤔 ... My whole back of my note 9 phone was shattered and the screen was cracked and I had an otterbox on it the entire time I had the thing. Long story short I bought the phone out after 2 years to switch services and when I went to switch they took my case off to switch sim cards and it was a shattered mess which I was highly disappointed about because I thought it was in good shape!. I could have gotten it fixed for around $400 or I could get a different phone. I didn\'t want nothing hella expensive I\'m tired of having to pay extra for phone payments and then just breaking them because obviously I\'m just not good with phones! I wanted something budget friendly with a good quality camera but still similar to androids system. I\'ve been team android forever now I just really don\'t care for their picture quality though, I have tried iphone out as well I had the iphone x and it just wasn\'t for me, however I did love the picture quality, so since I\'ve tried both ios and android and have certain things I like and disliked for both of them I figured it was time to give pixels a try!Pros:This phone is cute, little, and light weight phone, but like not so little that the screens no good. The screen to phone ratio is super nice and makes the phone feel smaller with a good sized screen. Which is what I wanted  I was over having huge, heavy bulky phones, I have little hands and I constantly was dropping my bigger phones...Picture quality is awesome! It def beats android and I think it might even beat iphones!Easy set up with transferring from my old phone to this one.The backs plastic! Which that was what I was looking for! People complain that ""oh its so boring looking with the plain black plastic back""... I don\'t get it, so youd rather have a pretty glass back that you end up covering with a bulky case... Cause that makes so much sense...I like how you can either have the navigation buttons or you can use the swipe controls. I like this so your not stuck with one or the other.battery lifes pretty good the charge seems to last me as long as my note 9 did.It def seems very durable. I do have a screen protector along with a case on this phone, not even a good case or screen protector just something cheap I grabbed. I\'ve dropped the phone a few times now and no have had no issues!Volume is also pretty goodCons:My biggest pet peeves with this phone isssss I hate the way screen shots are on this phone! Okay so the power button and the volume down button is how you take screen shots, which is normal for screen shots but on this phone the volume buttons and the power button are on the same side which makes it awkward to do and then sometimes when doing it the volume bar will pop up and turn everything all the way down and the bar just stays there which is annoying....I don\'t like how there\'s not as much customization as androids would have, such as changing the themes and stuff which sorta disappoints me.Conclusion:All in all, the pixel 4a really is not a bad budget phone for people like me that are just to rough for these high end all glass, thousand dollar phones... I would eventually like to get one of the nicer pixels this one was mostly to try it out and see if I even like them before getting one of the more expensive ones later down the road. Nice thing about pixels even there higher end phones such as the pixel 5 arent robbing you like some of these dang androids and iphones are!If your looking for a nice budget phone you won\'t go wrong getting this one. Would recommend!', 'Edit:  I traded this phone in at about the 18th month due to the lack of 5G.  I camp and T-Mobile\'s 5G has incredible range and speed--something I discovered with the wife\'s 4a 5G phone.  But for that I would have kept the phone the full 18 months.  At this point though the phone is worth less new due to only less than 18 months of remaining security updates.The last year or so has been a concern for me because I was afraid the mid-range phone I bought three years ago would break.  The new offerings have not been compelling, mainly offering better cameras but not significantly stronger processing and smaller manufacturing processes (e.g. 7nm).  That has changed just in the past few months and even days as there are now at least three compelling mid-range phones.  I bought the Pixel 4a because it was:  (1) One of the least expensive; (2) Offers one of the best OS upgrade/update policies; and (3) Is not made in China or by a Chinese firm--pick your reason not to like China right now--there are at least four.  There are things I wish it had, primarily microSD and a SD 765G processor, but the 730 is plenty fast. IMHO, we\'re well past the stage where most people have any real need for flagship processors (gamers excluded) I\'ll upgrade my wife\'s phone to 5G later, we would mainly need that for tethering, and we don\'t both need it.  It will probably be the 5G version of the Pixel 4a or the Samsung 51.The packaging is fairly basic, containing the phone, a 120 volt charging block, USB-C cable and a sim tool.  Also, it has a very useful adaptor from the large plug USB to USB-C.  That is given to help connect to your old phone, but is also useful for Yubi security keys.  The phone came roughly 60% charged and didn\'t require any security updates that I noticed, having Android 10 installed with security updates current to within 15 days (which makes me think I missed a security update being installed).As to the phone, it\'s roughly the same size as what I\'m used to coming from a Moto 5G Plus, but it is slightly narrower.  Overall I like the change.  I have not noticed any lag, and overall the phone seems very responsive, as it should coming from a phone that is over three years old in design. I wasn\'t sure I\'d like the fingerprint scanner on the back, but that has been fine. Setting up was a bit more difficult in that the automatic transfer process the phone tries to start apparently did not work at all, or maybe I\'m just not patient enough.  My old phone said ""preparing"" for over 20 minutes without any indication of progress on either phone.Setting up the old fashioned way was very quick, with my roughly 150 apps installing quickly.  The only problem I\'ve had is related to my Google Suite Account, which in the newer version of Android becomes a work account.  That keeps me from signing into Google maps with that account, which I\'m still trying to work around.  If you don\'t have a paid Google Suite Account this shouldn\'t be an issue.  I also had to change a few of the default settings, but surprisingly few.  I turned off a few things to save battery life, such as monitoring for songs in the background, and turned on the virtual navigation keys at the bottom of the screen, which I prefer to their gestures system.Too early to say anything about battery life because my use of the phone has been far from normal.  I\'ll report back if it can\'t get through a normal day with at least 25% of battery left.']"

It loads quickly and has great features in the apps. The storage are small if you play several games.  So I recommend downloading one or two games to play at a time.', ""Everytime when I'm on an application the phone stutters and lags. So I don't recommend buying the phone if you plan to do any gaming due to the constant stuttering/freezing."", 'I purchased these in ""used like new"" condition at a very good price and after receiving phone, description was spot on.I have found the camera to be ok to good and certainly not terrible. You simply need to know what kind of lighting works in your photo. You can\'t really expect this phone at this price to deliver good photos in poor lighting. Yes, I did try other camera software but eventually went back to the OEM camera software. If you know how to take a good photo, you shouldn\'t have any problems with the camera delivering more than acceptable results.As per complaints regarding ""finger print reader"", I hear you. I have gotten it to work much better by tweaking a couple of settings. In settings option, I turned off ""auto-rotate"", this seemed to improve reader greatly. Still, you need to take your time and have a clean finger and clean reader. It still doesn\'t work 100% of the time. Sometimes it works seamlessly and other times just stubborn :-(It updated OS to Android 11 along with a couple of security updates with the last coming on 12/01/21. Additionally, I do not use the stock launcher. Phone, WIFI and DATA connection are great and has not disappointed. Using Mint Mobile which uses T-Mobile.All in all, at this price, the Nord N100 is a decent phone. I would say it delivers as expected 90% of the time. My biggest complaint is still the finger-print reader, other than that, I\'m actually pleased with the phone.', ""Great phone with tons of storage.  You can't do better for the price."", 'I gave 4 stars because this is the second one I got.The first one arrived locked an I had to return it. Was bummed but it does happen.Anyway, I really like this phone.Camera quality is good.Its what you would expect from any smart phone really.I have had it for a little bit now and have not ran into any issues with it.This is my first oneplus phone and I bought it as a trial to see how it compares to other androids and Id say its worth the money. I will more than likely upgrade to a new version in the future.My cons would be lack of customizability in terms of fonts an other very insignificant options that really dont matter. But if your a person where that stuff matters, look else where.I really cant complain as this phone has met all my expectations. Will definitely make future buys from OnePlus.', 'I ordered a replacement Nord n100 for my new Nord n100 because it would not receive text messages. I spent hours, unsuccessfully, trying to resolve the issue.  The replacement phone did not receive text messages either.  Then I saw this comment for the Nord N200 on Amazon ""If your device is not receiving text messages or experiencing error when making phone calls, you need to contact carriers\' technical support to add CDMALess feature."" I called Verizon tech support (611), requested they add ""CDMALess feature"" to my phone.  It took about a minute to make the change (once I got to a person), and I started to get text messages.  I recommend all sellers of Nord phones add this message to their information about Nord phones, and Oneplus clearly state this in the information provided with their phones.  Verizon also stated the CDMAless feature prevents upgrading to some Verizon plans.  I am returning the 2nd phone I got.', ""This is a dependable phone with great resolution and battery life. It recharges via USB-C. It is one of the best values I've had when it comes to phone. It comes with a bright red USB-C cord.My big gripe is that it has only one speaker that puts out just decent audio. Hopefully, there will be future models with wireless charging."", ""Walmart app does not work with this phone. You can scan under very bright conditions (extremely bright) but paying is impossible.A headset plugged in with a y splitter worked under 10. Version 11 broke it and it's been more than a month without a fix.Splitting windows on the phone is often reliable but breaks in a very real broken way every once in a while. When you see it, you'll know it.Shutdown menu on 10 was flawless. On 11, it's incredibly ugly and after seeing how 10 handled shutdown with a useful menu, you'll swear they went backwards with a 11.The upgrade to 11 broke compatibility with the SD card formatted under version 10. I currently have 153 GB of data held hostage by this bug and there is no fix in sight.There are 3 main screens, ambient, lock and home. You can't change the clock on the lock screen and you can't make the home clock as sweet as the ambient clock (no consistency).Android assistant is often slow and often has issues to the point where it starts to feel just broken. It wasn't so bad (or bad at all) on 10.With all that said, keep in mind, most of the above mentioned issues are a software fix away but with these bugs reported over a month ago, it does feel like it's taking forever. I hope these are addressed soon. Fingers crossed.If there was a way to simply stay on version 10 (you'll be forced to upgrade at some point) and the Walmart app just worked, this phone would be almost perfect. This is what I thought I bought and I feel swindled and let down that 11 is mostly responsible for all the negative.With all that said, responsiveness otherwise is pretty decent and acceptable. The battery size and overall time between charging is excellent. The phone feels and looks good. The oxygen style is pleasing. The price is fair (on 10, the price was excellent).I was so close to buying a second phone and after updating to 11, I'm really glad I didn't but with all that said, if OnePlus fixed all the above issues I'd seriously consider getting another one.The phone I bought was excellent but I hate the phone I was forced to upgrade to."", ""I've used just about every low end smart phone sold in the US over the years.  I finally got smart and bought a Nord N100.  I absolutely LOVE this phone.The battery life is one of the longest lasting batteries I've seen.  I usually have Lubetube music playing 4-8 hours a day at work or some other form of streaming program.  End of the day, phone is at ~65%.  So two full days of non stop use 8 hours a day and still have battery left, cant beat itWhile it does have google programs on it, its not filled with crap like a lot of the other cheap phones out there.  I have not rooted this phone, dont know if I will even look into rooting it as the phone does everything I want it to.  Even has a sensor kill button that shuts off every sensor on the phone (which is nice for the times I need to wear my tinfoil hat)Hoping they make a 2022 variant of the N100 otherwise I'll be buying another one of these if/when it dies"", 'I switched to the N100 from a Poco M3.The N100 has mostly stock Android, where the M3 has Xiaomi\'s horrendous MIUI, but in absolutely every other way, the N100 is inferior to the Poco.The 720p display is shockingly bad. Text looks awful, and since most of the content we view on phones is text, that\'s a problem. Dot pitch is very coarse causing severe ""screen door effect"", especially with bright content. UI elements often do not scale well to the very low resolution (an example is the VOLTE and VoWIFI logo on the status bar).But the phone performs poorly, too. It\'s exceptionally slow and struggles massively with multitasking. I contently have to close background apps to keep it chugging at anything resembling usable speed.Despite that, battery life is the worst I\'ve ever encountered. I could go 2 days of moderate use without needing a charge with the M3. The N100 barely makes it a day with light use. And so the while it nags about battery hog apps that were not a problem on any other phone. Enabling active battery management kills background performance and is not a viable option. There does not seem to be a middle ground.And the build quality is shockingly bad. Mine has a squeaky spot on the bottom right edge where the case back and side are not properly fitted. You can feel it flex while holding the phone normally.The camera is so much worse than I could have imagined. Might as well use your laptop webcam instead.And it\'s impossible to disable the mute shortcut of Power+Vol Up. This is a problem because the placement of the buttons means I accidentally press that combination nearly every time I put the phone in my pocket.The Poco M3 is a lot of phone for the money. After using it, vI bored OnePlus would improve on that formula.They did not. This phone is a frustrating disappointment that fails to love up to even its miniscule price.']"

Pleased to find ear buds in the pack too.', 'BOUGHT this in May 2020!Almost May, 2022 UPDATEYES! I am STILL using this phone and am still very happy with it. Main issues STILL are crappy 101 Google app updates...DO NOT auto update it; read up, the maximum volume could be better; and I burnt the screen in on the home page, my bad. Battery hanging on; buy a good quality, fast charging cable.I bought it HERE as an open box from the warehouse and would do that again. Is now selling for MORE than I paid for it. Dropped many, many times. A decent bumper case does the job. FANTASTIC camera with no camera or Google Photos app update.17 Mo. UPDATE:This phone is still performing WELL and I keep looking for an upcoming replacement when Google pulls the plug on it. HOWEVER, it appears that I probably have 1 OS update left on it. I am getting about 8 hours out of the original battery...less if I stream radio or video.NEW development this month: the icons on the home page are now burnt into the screen. This is annoying to me.It overheats in very hot sun, and if I stream music for an hour.I have done some comparisons and THOUGHT that I had decided to replace this with a Pixel 5 when the time comes. But every comparison I do with a 4 or a 5 says this is better!  I definitely got my money\'s worth out of this phone as it is still selling for what I paid for it here! > Open box buy on Amazon Warehouse.Warning: JUST keep auto updates turned off and carefully read the reviews for any Google provided Android app parts and pieces. They usually hurt it rather than help it. This phone runs JUST FINE without a whole list of GoogleCRAP, including turning many of them off. Do not believe those screens that say ""may not work"" without them.15 Mo. UPDATE to my reviews below is right here HERE:The battery no longer lasts the day, but it is not awful. The phone overheated the other day when I left it in the sun in the car and shut off. I have dropped this over and over with no damage with just a decent bumper style case. I am still fighting with GOOGLE and their half baked roll outs of bits and pieces of their software-- Do not let this phone auto update. I HAVE figured out which ones not to update and I have ended up with a stable phone. ItDOES appear that sometimes Pixel 3s are oddballs and app designers and even Google have to roll out an update of something just for this phone.Read reviews in the Play Store. I do have to clear the caches of my apps every once in a while, but I think I would blame that on the apps. The camera is still FANTASTIC and the Google camera app is way better than it was when I bought the phone..I also own a much newer cheaper Motorola (Moto E) phone (backup phone carrier) in addition to this one. The speaker volume is louder than the Pixel. The flashlight is brighter than the Pixel. Everything else-- no comparison..ALL in ALL I am still liking this phone and it appears to be holding up. When it comes time, I will probably update this phone by buying some version of the Pixel 4. However, when I read the specs on all of the other Pixels, this one still wins for me. I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN. I am going to see how long I can keep it going. I have used this phone with TWO cell networks (Verizon + TMo) and had no issues..The call quality is much better when this is not on speaker phone. I uses several Open Source apps on this phone and they work fine (RadioDroid, AnySoftKeyboard, Simple Notes, Simple Calendar)..****************************************OLDER Reviews:I was pretty convinced of the quality and security of my iPhone and used it long past the payoff date. But Apple\'s bad battery, broken home button and repeated half-baked iOS releases convinced me to give this phone a try..It\'s not the latest and greatest, but appears to be very good quality for what I paid for it. I am getting used to the pages and pages of settings, and having to clear the cache, as it has been several years since I had an Android..I bought this from the Amazon Warehouse store and the phone appeared unused. Yeah, as some reviews state, battery life could be a tad better..10 Month UPDATE!I am still using this phone and would give it a 9 out of 10 for how much I like it. I am not a phone geek. But I do not like low end phones. I frequently use this phone for taking Ebay and Etsy photographs. I am running it on an MNVO of Verizon. I have dropped it several times with a middle of the road bumper case and no screen protector...not a scratch. Google Play Store STILL fools around with updating a LONG LIST of pieces of software for this phone at the drop of the hat. Often, their ideas are half baked. I have come to a happy medium with this by loading some Open Source apps for certain things. I WILL say that the Google PHOTO app, which was an Android 10 disaster has gotten better and better. And the Google FILES app now allows me to clean up and remove junk without paying for something else. I recently bought a Moto E phone as a backup..and compared to this Pixel, it\'s a piece of crap. My next phone will probably be a Pixel 4 or 4a, as I am that happy with this..6 MONTH UPDATE 12.20.20OK - So I STILL like the HARDWARE of this phone. It works well. The buttons work well. I bought an C adapter and my plug in ear buds work well. I have dropped it several times without a super monstrous case over it and it has not succumbed to damage. The battery life is not great, but still about a day unless I play streaming radio all day..BUT....Google\'s constant meddling and redesigning of the Android software parts is still driving me crazy. It is not just ONE system update like an iPhone. This has maybe 20 little apps that can be updated independently of each other. Often the update sucks and I have to uninstall it. Often the settings for these pieces contradict each other. Google appears to totally redesign EVERYTHING all of the time, just for the heck of it..When I gave a poor rating to the keyboard in the Play Store, Google\'s response (internal notes, accidentally posted publicly) was that I was extremeley negative, brand aversive and should just be IGNORED! Nice! So will I stick with Android for a while, probably. But my next Android will not be made by Google. Hopefully by then, their monopoly will be broken anyway..UPDATE 10.15.20STILL like this phone but hate Google and their hair-brained update schemes, still consisting of 20 different ""parts"". Totally lost respect, even though some features are very convenient. They keep ""playing"" with stuff. On a bright note, I have flat out droppped this phone on its unprotected face and....nuthin!.UPDATE 6.24.20I still like this phone A LOT. But Android 10 appears to be a work in progress in regard to photo handling. This is a shame because of the FANTASTIC camera on this phone. I am hoping that Android 11 solves some of this. However, every time there is an update, it is an improvement..UPDATE 7.1.20I STILL like this phone! There have been some Android and Google app updates, which have been improvements. Google keeps trying to take over my life and privacy, so I turn quite a few settings off. I still had to load an album and a photo cropping app to do some things I could do on iOS in WAY less clicks. Android is loaded with over-functionality. The battery life is tolerable; about all day with frequent use..UPDATE 7.31.20 and 8.16.20Well, I STILL like this phone very much. It\'s GOOGLE I hate. Every little function of this phone is a separate and constantly updated app by Google. Most updates seems to improve or add a function, while breaking something that you need to WORK. Sometimes an update breaks something on a aftermarket app, and the developer will blame my phone model. Some of these apps appear to be just Google spying..What I hate: NO square photos, more clicks to edit photos, constant cashe clearing, anything Google has privacy settings that I have to CHANGE, because they are invasive..What I like: Low light camera feature is fantastic; phone does not lag; phone has never frozen on me; contextual menus available everywhere, very convenient. (I would recommend keeping an eye on cache usage of your apps. Almost any squirrely behavior I have experienced was a badly performing app, not the phone. I am a former iPhone SE user (2 of them) and was worried about the size of this phone. If you are a SMALL person who needs a SMALL phone, this one fits the bill.

I purchased it at a sale price. Wanted to wait a bit before writing a review, 4/15/23. I'm not sure how much my review would help those that didn't have downgraded features previously.With the upgrade I've gained some features I didn't have before and overall better hardware. The camera, ram, and memory (no SD slot) alone has all been major improvements for me. I do like the bed time mode that turns my screen black and white at night to help with eye strain. It's lightweight. I'm happy to have nfc feature back as well as the finger print. I've had both these features on other prepaid phones, just not my last one. I enjoy having a wireless charging option that I didn't have before. There's way more software features I'm impressed with, preventing battery overcharge, gestures (I don't use majority of these), pull down tiles, conversations, split screen, to name a few that I didn't have before.The battery life is okay. Definitely not two days worth. Initially the battery lasted me the entire day with normal usage and pull from constantly finding signal while I was at work and still had a fairly significant battery percentage when I went to bed. My previous phone's battery drained enough I had to recharge it during lunch and going home. The Motorola edge battery still lasts me all day with a full charge but at a significant less percentage when I unwind at night that I have to charge it and limit my usage. My days off though the battery survives the entire day.I connected the Bluetooth to my vehicle for music. I noticed on a fairly regularly basis I have to disconnect the Bluetooth and reconnect it again to get a smooth stream in music and avoiding the skipping between beats like an old CD player. It's annoying enough I don't want to bother at times and turn to the radio.I attempted to setup my Bluetooth wireless keyboard to this phone multiple times. It'll pair without an issue. Whenever I type, the phone doesn't recognize majority of the keys. The keys it does register changes letters to numbers. I know it's not the keyboard itself because I have connected it to other smart phones and an ipad without any issue.It has the capability to change different app volume levels while keeping your main media volume at 100. Facebook media level can be at 50%, YouTube at 75%, chrome 30%, etc. I had this on my previous phone so I'm familiar with how it works. I can't seem to change the apps to a different level without changing my main media volume level. Kinda annoying there.Wish it had the battery life it claims it has and Bluetooth technology didn't seem shoty at best for what I've used it for. Overall I'm happy with the phone."", ""To make it fast:+Great performance. Normal usage and gaming feels really smooth on this phone.

As the title says, when it works, it works great. Problem is, if the phone isn\'t reset every few days, some functions will stop working. Primary is making and receiving calls. Despite T-Mobile\'s insistence that we should have a great signal at our house, it is really pretty crappy, so the phone makes call all the time over WiFi. Not a problem, unless you forget to reset it regularly. If you don\'t, it stops making and receiving calls. Oh, the person calling you hears it ringing, but the phone doesn\'t. There is no record that a call was received. If you try to make a call, it says ""cell service not available"". No kidding, that is why it always makes WiFi calls. Unfortunately, the only way to get anything to work again is to do a reset. Frustrating doesn\'t begin to cover it.The phone does, at least at times, have a really good battery life. Maybe related to resets, but sometimes it will run through the battery in 10 hours. Other times, I have gone 3 days before charging.There was a promise somewhere of at least one Android version upgrade, but I haven\'t seen anything yet. Memory capacity and processing speed are great.', ""After 14 days of ownership, I am using 35gb of the phone's 256GB storage with no bloatware.  My previous Samsung plastic phone of 6 years only had 16GB of internal storage and lots of bloatware.  The external SD card stored our photos and music only.All MOTO features work as advertised so far.  The photos and screen on this $250 phone rival our $700 I-Phone 13 photos.  But.....we are not power users and we are quite elderly.  So, we probably will not challenge the technology of this phone any time soon.I use my JBL ear buds for music and the sound is vastly improved from the prior phone.All Plastic?  Well it is a phone and not a baseball so it meets my needs.Waterproof?  No, but neither was the old 2017 Samsung and it is still running capably and never got soaked.We are pleased and hope to have a forever phone!"", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Pros –Nice and snappy(good job Mediatek)Screen is responsive, 120 & 144Hz are niceFingerprint sensor is very accurateCameras were good, even ultrawide(see samples)Very light compared to my G Stylus 2021Moto Gestures as alwaysCons –OLED not as nice as I would think compared to my Moto G Stylus 2021OIS not very good in video modeBattery life not great without turning off 5G and switching to 60HzReady For does NOT work as advertisedConclusion – While it had some nice features, I returned it.*I don’t exactly why this caught my eye but I knew I wanted to stay within Motorola, hoping they would release something with better cameras. I decided to on this one despite the lack of reviews, the Edge+ with Snapdragon processor being the more reviewed by a 5 to 1 but also more expensive. The reviews on this phone resulted in everyone being surprised how well the Mediatek processor worked as it is know as a more budget brand so performance is usually lacking but in the Edge it worked surprisingly well.This thing was very light, so light I kept wondering if it was fake or had no battery. It was real and worked fine on Mint Mobile, the only thing missing was Wi-Fi calling which I could get on my G Stylus. I was almost considering a Pixel 6A for the cameras but read it had other problems, one main thing being the fingerprint sensor. Not wanting to give up my Moto gestures, I went with the Edge. It’s in-screen fingerprint sensors works great and had no problems with accuracy or speed.Overall, I was pleased with the cameras, both the 50MP main and the 13MP ultrawide. You can see the photos I uploaded. I’m not a huge camera buff and looking at sample pictures before I purchased, I couldn’t tell a whole lot of difference between an iPhone, Pixel or this phone but watching a blind test on YT for the sensor used in this phone, it was nearly last place. Where I really did not like the phone was the OIS(optical image stabilization) when taking video. The video did not look any different than my G Stylus that does not have stabilization.As far as the screen. Yes, very nice and it was responsive. It was bright. It just wasn’t OMG, I finally got an OLED screen. I’m not sure why tech reviewers bash regular LCD screens. Again, it was not leaps and bounds beyond the screen on my G Stylus. Another side affect, was using the refresh rate in 144Hz or Auto mode decreased battery life which is to be expected. I changed it to 60Hz and even at that setting I still think it eked out snappiness over my G Stylus. Very smooth even at 60Hz imo.As far as battery life, when I first got it I thought it drained pretty quick. I turned the screen refresh to 60Hz and turned off 5G(I really don’t notice a whole lot of difference between LTE and 5G) then it was much better imo. I did not do structured tests so take this battery life opinion with a grain of salt.*Where this really failed and where I fell for Motorola advertising was the Ready For mode. It is supposed to activate automatically when plugging in a USB C to HDMI connector. I tried a Tisofu multi adaptor with HDMI and an Anker USB C to HDMI dongle. Neither was recognized. Only one reviewer showed this working and was not using the Motorola Ready For dock(that costs sixty bucks) but he was using the Edge+ which has a Snapdragon processor not this phone with its Mediatek processor. He did not provide the brand of HDMI adaptor in the video but it was clear he was not using the official Motorola dock.I then downloaded the Ready For application for Windows. This allowed me to connect my phone wirelessly to my Windows 10 PC. Least to say, it was underwhelming. I can open Chrome, Photos, Google Search, some other apps but not any video apps as you would get a black screen. But what is the point of this? I’m already on my PC so can do a lot of that. Since it was wireless and had some lag, there was no point gaming. I then tried connecting a USB C to USB 3.1 to my PC to get a wired connection. Again, I’ve seen someone do this on the Edge+. When I plug it in, using the drop-down menu from the top of the screen, you can goto the USB Mode and there is an option to select, say from ""No data transfer"" to ""Ready For"". Ok, now we are getting somewhere. I went ahead and chose Ready For usb mode expecting a better and faster wired connection. Nope, starting the Desktop mode, it just connected wirelessly again.As mentioned above, I had tried a wired connection with no luck. This was tried on an Asus monitor and a HiSense TV. As I’ve seen in videos and some moderators on the Motorola forum mentioned, you just need to plug it in and it starts automatically. No choosing USB modes or starting any app on the phone. Well, that didn’t work for me. Motorola does sell a dock but no where in there marketing videos or within the Ready For app(where you can click a link called Learn more) do they mention this is a strict requirement for this mode to work. I\'m not spending another 60 dollars to test this.I then decided to try to connect wirelessly to see what devices the phone would detect. It did not detect any of my TVs but it did show all of my Roku devices. Searching on Miracast and Roku, I found Roku added Miracast functionality as far back as Roku 3 so about 2014, 2015. I also found out it is not a well developed standard and most people end up buying Microsoft’s dedicated Miracast wireless dongle. Well, my phone did connect to my Roku Streambar…ONCE and never again. Each subsequent attempt just timing out after 30 seconds. I did find others have experienced the exact same issue on this phone.End result, I may have kept the phone but I do not like deceptive advertising. I will be returning this phone and keeping my G Stylus. Motorola still has great value but overall, I just wasn’t wowed by this newer phone compared to what I had and I don’t like when companies use false advertising and ambiguous requirements for a supposedly stand-out feature. Motorola needs to more strictly define the conditions under which Ready For works.I’ve uploaded a main camera pic, ultra-wide pic, low-light main camera pic and a video showing the failed attempts to connect to the Roku Streambar.Congrats if you actually read all of this.', 'Great Phone Wireless charging is Awesome!', 'Seen some quirky issues, when having to many apps open. Seems to resolve after closing some apps.  Also the phone has shutdown couple times, for no reason.  Google search has info on this.  Had about 2 months, and happy for the most part.  Camera much better than last phone.

The one plus performance was much better but its hard to beat the price of the Edge.The phone is a decent size and the font largest size works for me. The voice quality is good & I have only had a few occasions where ppl call and said it went straight to vmail (could be cellular network). Overall I am generally satisfied with the phone.However, there are a few issues that I hope Motorola addresses in their nect updates.Firstly, I dont like the scrolling of the pull down menu. It would be best if the titles were shortened so no scrolling takes place.Secondly, when a call is placed the phone does not send the call & you have to end the current session & place the call again for it to go through. This does not happen everytime but often enogh to be a concern.Finally, when the wifi is turned on and you then leave the wifi coverage area, the phone takes a while to switch to the cellular network data. Calls  goes through fine but if I were to try to access a website or app, they both simply spool until the phone transition to the cellular data.Besides these issues I am goving the phone a 4 star because of the sub $350 price. It almost gives you the feel of a flagship phone without the high price. FIX THESE ISSUES MOTOROLA!!!!!', 'It has just above average specs and performance, and despite having a 5,000mah battery, the software and optimization doesn\'t feel like it\'s utilizing the battery performance well. The build is quite lightweight, the frame is hollow smooth plastic, but it does feel decently built otherwise. The performance doesn\'t feel like it matches the price, and this retailed for $599? For $350, you can buy an older flagship and get a brighter display and better overall performance and optimization, as well as better specs. For instance, a Samsung S20+ leftover stock, and even that has Android 13, faster performance and optimization, way more features, with similar battery life, despite having a lower capacity battery. Also, has a way brighter screen, and better cameras and mics. The only thing this has going for it, is, better 5G support, a144hz display, a better fingerprint reader with light under the reader, and slightly fuller speakers, yet, with bloated and slightly distorted mids and highs. The lack of features however, and lesser all around performance, makes this a $300 phone at most. As for value, the Nord N20 5G looks nice, if you can deal with slightly less ram, and battery capacity.Another thing to think about with buying a new/open box leftover stock S20+, is that it comes with a charger, this does not, making the price not worth $350 when you can get one of those for the same price.Update: Battery percentage drains rapidly over minor tasks, software is outdated and has bugs, feels very barbones, the phone doesn\'t always feel responsive, or has random glitches, for instance, ringing with vibration. After the incoming call ringtone stopped, the phone kept vibrating repeatedly for several seconds, despite the incoming call dropping. I get random touchscreen delays or notification bar not pulling down as well as scrolling randomly freezes. Display is underwhelming and dim; I would have preferred an IPS LCD and having paid less than this now inferior version of OLED (as opposed to AMOLED), because AMOLED is much brighter and clearer; there\'s also this fogginess about about certain colors on a white background, or text doesn\'t seem the clearest, and whites feel like they are blowing out some text and images. To say the least, despite being an OLED, the display feels very limited and not very vivid; an LCD panel that gets brighter would have been a better choice for this phone. The materials that make up the frame of the phone feel very cheap, and I would imagine the charging port getting torn after repeated plugging and unplugging.The only things I like about this phone are the modems for mobile networks and wifi (which, which the wifi tech could have been a little better for the price), good touchscreen and sensors, decent performance, speakers, and call quality. I don\'t feel like the price is right, not at its original MSRP, and not even at $350. The least that could be done is fixing the software, actually providing updates, and making that 5,000mah battery useful. There\'s a strong chance of this phone being returned; $350 is a lot for what feels like an average execution, and forsaken piece of tech.I now understand why Samsung is worth every penny.UPDATE 6/26/23: Knocked down a star for a poor execution of an otherwise decent product. OLED panel is disappointing, seems like higher than 60hz refresh rates reduces color crispness and display quality, but the overall quality is just not that great to begin with, system app randomly crashing, UI feels sluggish, and very unoptimized, have yet to see a software update to improve anything, battery performance is average despite having relatively large capacity, and a ""power efficient processor"", so they say, especially when using 5G, and/or Auto/144hz refresh rates, the microphone and camera quality is lacking; one of these things should at least be better than the other. No matter what good you try to find in this phone, something is always lacking. I will say however, I do like the display glass quality, and it is one of the few 5G phones on the market in its class supporting mmWave, so I\'ll will keep my original star rating.As of August 15th 2023, there is no major firmware upgrade released for my device. Also, I\'ve been experiencing call issues with the microphone.']"

I have been with Verizon since they took over GTE accounts. So at least 20 years. Was happily grandfathered into the 3 G network and have been as happy as a Clam with the LG extrovert for the last 4-5 years. Was on my 2nd one. Told me last year I had to upgrade-it was a lie. I didn\'t and I have been on 3 G all this year as well. But I knew they were working to shut down for real this year when they sent me a stupid flip phone I didn\'t ask for. Like if I don\'t want an Apple phone I must want to go back to hitting a button 3 times to text. WRONG. I actually bought blackberry last year right before they shut down. So I was ready for an upgrade. Just not ready to let go of my keyboard. So I bought this phone is Sept. And have been getting the run around from their stupid staff ever since. My 3 G phone didn\'t have a SIM card. They wouldn\'t send me a sim card for this one because I didn\'t buy it from them. So they kept sending me to the store. Where they wouldn\'t give or sell me a sim card for it. And they told me categorically that I couldn\'t get the phone on the network. IT WAS A LIE. I read the review from Mid Nov about someone having a different phone on the 4 g network and I bought that phone he said off Amazon, took it into the store, got it put on the network and then immediately had him take the sim card out of that phone and put it in mine. Right there. That minute. So I walked out of the Verizon store with THIS phone working. And returned the one I brought in there to get the Sim card. If you already have a 4 G device? You don\'t even need to talk to them. Just take your Sim card out of whatever phone you have? And put it in and you are done. If you are like me? And were on a 3 G device and are upgrading because they are forcing you to upgrade but don\'t want to let go of your keyboard? I am with you. It may seem like a lot of work to buy a different phone to get the sim card but I am delighted with this phone. The keyboard is a little different than my original keyboard but it\'s still better than they one on my Stupid work I-phone that I hate. Plus this phone-I did the research on this one vs their ""Slim"" version and I\'m married to a techie and he liked the capabilities on this one and the batter life way better and it seems indestructible.  You can do it. I used the Kyocera to do it per the Nov Review. You can do it. I just did it on 12/28/22 One day before they told me they were going to shut my phone down.', ""Pros:- Great for that throwback feeling if you wanna feel like you're back in 2008!- Keyboard is legitimately fun to type on, very tactile and clicky- Battery life is awesome, can definitely go 2 days or more without needing a charge- Headphone jack is always welcomeCons:- The screen is just way too small for anything meaningful- 1:1 aspect ratio means some apps don't scale properly, made worse that the screen is so small- Cameras actually remind me of phones from that 2008 period- For such a small phone, still quite thick and heavy (could be a benefit if that's what you're into)Unfortunately the main deal breaker for me (and why I'm returning it) is because Android 11 on this was just too buggy for me to do anything meaningful on this - e.g. Gmail just kept force closing for no reason, even after multiple reboots, reinstallsBlast from the past, but for me it's too far gone"", 'È un telefono bellissimo, solido e compatto, veloce, reattivo, non è vero scatti foto di scarsa qualità e la batteria è di lunga durata. Ho avuto sempre blackberry e questo tel non mi ha fatto ""mancare"" il brand. Il mio personale problema è solo uno: il display. Troppo, troppo piccolo, con whatsapp fatico a leggere i messaggi. Del resto ho 52 anni, ne avessi avuti 10 in meno non l\'avrei mai tolto. Peccato. Passo al Titan.', ""I was concerned about the size of the screen, but it's no worse than using a larger screened phone with half the display covered by an on screen keyboard. If you're a serious gamer then this won't be for you, the screen is just too small, but for browsing, messaging and calling it's perfectly fine.  After setting the phone up a pop-up appeared to say that an update was available so the latest security update for Android 11 was installed.The physical keyboard itself is quite easy to use. I have large hands but with a little perseverance the keyboard is fairly easy to master. There is also the option to have some keyboard functions on screen, which simplifies some tasks. Performance is good, apps and web  pages load quickly and battery life appears to be quite good, no doubt this is due to not having to power a large screen.Build quality is good, I would, however, I would recommend a TPU or book style case, as the rear of the phone is quite smooth and therefore susceptible to scratching if not protected.Some apps don't display properly due to the screen size but there is a setting that helps with this, which makes the experience tolerable.Sound through the earpiece and speaker is fairly good - not Dolby quality but adequate for a device of this size. There is a programmable shortcut button which is very useful and provides PTT functionality for  VoiP apps such as Zello or can be used to open specific apps which are user selectable with function settings for both long and short presses.The physical keyboard itself takes a little effort to master - anyone used to the BlackBerry Curve will be familiar with this, but the keyboard function are a little different to the BlackBerry. Once mastered, the keyboard becomes intuitive. There is an IR transmitter on board and an app that lets you set the phone up as a remote for devices such as TV, satellite box, sound system etc. I have used it with my smart TV with good results.Good value for the price and for those who prefer a small form factor and physical keyboard, it's ideal. I like Unihertz products, I use an Atom XL for my main phone, and I bought this one specifically for business use, much better than a slab phone for my purposes.To sum up, it's a neat, small device, well constructed and capable phone but it is in a somewhat niche market."", ""I've always preferred keyboard phones because the screen keyboards don't always correctly pick up my touches and/or identify the letting I'm trying to choose. I also wanted a much smaller phone that is easier to carry. This one was the closest I could find.Only Verizon service is available where we live. It does work with Verizon if you do what is suggested, which is to activate the phone with an already activated sim card. (If you don't have one, the verizon store may or may not help you. The local one pretended they didn't have any, but I know other people who were successful at other stores). However, once the phone is activated, it takes a day for it to correctly identify the carrier and work; prior to that mine didn't work at all, and then worked even though it said I was on Sprint. After that it was fine.It is quite heavy, with a nice build feel. The keys are easy to press and tactile. I get the same number of bars as much more expensive phones.A few caveats:1. I can't receive text images. I read that using another text app will work, but I tried 5 of them and none do. Sending images is just fine, people get them.2. the screen is a different orientation than most phones, so every so often a website will be difficult to see without a lot of scrolling, and there are a few times when I could not enter information (like a password) because the input area is blocked by the screen keyboard symbol popup. A few symbols are in a single row that shows on the screen with the alpha keyboard, but if you need others, that can be an issue.3. When texting, it keeps giving suggestions on the word. I never look at the screen while entering, so now and again I've typed something and when I look up the phone has 'corrected' what I wrote (incorrectly). I can't find out how to turn off this 'feature.' It may be an android setting that I just can't find.4. As with most phones, it shows/displays the android settings differently, so if you are looking on the web for suggestions on how to do X, and it says to do a,b,c in the settings, those settings are often not where they say they are. I know that the android menu path is different for Samsung and LG, but these seem to require even more searching.5. It does not have Qi charging.All in all I'm happy with it."", 'Only downside I would say is backlight for keyboard is not the brightest!  And strange placement for function and shift keys on top of keyboard. Also running old Android 11 with old security update. Otherwise reminds me of my old BB Curve keyboard.', 'Les + : Téléphone Hybride avec écran tactile et clavier azerty.Charge rapide et se décharge lentement (je suis pas ""H24"" sur mon tel).Internet OKPas de soucis avec appli Uber.Les - : Téléphone TRES TRES LOURD+++ !!!

Raté...', ""I got this to get my smartphone habits back in control and I achieved that from day 1. You need to readjust your expectations from a smartphone and train your brain to use a physical keyboard again. If you're OK with this then you'll love it.Personally, I can say that this phone is not multimedia friendly but allows you to focus on actual productive tasks. I can do anything that matters in this phone except, God knows why, pair it with my car. Great battery life and the speakers beat anything that I've had before.I'd like to see it able to upgrade the android version and the screen to maximize the surface in the phone (big dead band in between keyboard and lower limit of screen)."", 'Had the phone for 7 months used everyday. It is really cool, with a well built body, which can be disassembled by undoing the machine screws. It has a fair bit of customization through the settings.The battery is very good.the camera is dreadful and and you must tap to focus or the whole image will be blurred.The touch screen is useful but very small and very un-optimized for web pages and google maps is dreadful, a huge green block covers most of the screen.The keyboard is reactive and of course mechanical. But the layout is very inconvenient at times, the ""/"" symbol is right next to the alt key, which is required to be pressed before you can type a ""/"". The finger print sensor get in the way of the button which opens your tabs.Worst of all is that the phone has completely crashed to a Chinese sub menu on three occasions. On one of these occasions I had to take it to a phone repair shop for the guy to try boot up the phone again. As said previously, the phone is very un-optimized for certain websites, making it inoperable some times.Overall, I would not recommend as a day to day phone, the drawbacks are tolerable for a few months but then they become a pain in the arse after a while.']"

Everybody has different uses and lifestyles, so it\'s good to have options in the market for phones, which are pocket computers and the subset of computers they fit into is tablets, just a touchscreen interface. So a phone is just the small size range of tablets. They are general purpose computers that could be used for endless purposes in endless styles.For my own personal purposes, I prefer to use a laptop/tablet as much as possible and I have very little use for voice calls or texting on a phone. I avoid voice calls as much as possible and I found some good options to handle SMS/texting on my laptop/tablet instead of my phone--the best one seems to be Google Messages, but I\'ve also had good results with Pushbullet and there are others.So here\'s what I want a phone to do primarily:--camera, taking photos/videos, mostly for practical documentation, not to win NatGeo contests--voice recording for voice memos--voice input for typing--timers, alarms, stopwatch, clock--music/audio playback, battery info for earbudsAnd here\'s what I don\'t need a phone to do usually, maybe once in a while at most:--phone calls--texting, emailing, messaging in general, text input in general--video playback or editing--web browsing--social mediaSo basically I\'m in an extreme minority of people who don\'t want to use phones the way they\'re commonly used, but I don\'t want a dumbphone and I\'m not trying to reduce my phone usage; I\'m trying to actually increase my phone usage by making a phone a more useful tool based on its portability and convenience. Amazingly, people are still buying tiny clip-on mp3 players these days, which are a huge advantage over phones for audio playback while exercising. Before I started using smartphones about 6 years ago, I was an avid user of Sansa Clip. But it really doesn\'t make any sense to have a single-purpose device like that with huge compromises on screens, firmware, software, etc. It makes way more sense to have a regular smartphone that\'s shrunk into the smallest usable form factor.So Jelly 2 is pretty close to that, although the Palm phone is actually much closer because it\'s half the size and weight of Jelly 2. I had a hard time choosing between Palm and Jelly 2. I got the Jelly 2 because of the more up-to-date software, better specs on the processor and memory, and because the customizable side button seemed like a killer feature. But I\'m not happy to have a device that\'s twice the size and weight as it could be just for the sake of longer battery life. That doesn\'t make any sense, because there are lots of great tiny powerbanks available to recharge as needed. You can buy a tiny powerbank and a Palm phone and have the same battery life and convenience as a larger built-in battery, but in many usage scenarios it\'s a big advantage to not have that extra size and weight on the phone itself. People who complain about the Palm battery life are missing the point and maybe don\'t realize how many tiny powerbanks are easy and cheap to buy and easy to carry and use. Charging twice a day instead of once using a tiny powerbank that takes up hardly any space in a bag? Perfect solution instead of making the phone twice as big and heavy. So I might even switch to Palm in the future, but I\'m testing the Jelly 2 for now and I love it.The elephant in the room is text input. It\'s almost impossible to use this phone for typing with fingers. Part of that is a software problem because all the OSKs I\'ve found so far use screen space inefficiently. There\'s a bunch of ""large button"" and alternative keyboard apps, but so far I haven\'t found one that solves the software problem nicely. Part of the problem is the inherent physical limitations of the device and the user\'s fingers. I have very large hands. I wear XL gloves. My fingers are not fat, but they\'re larger than average, so that\'s a big variable for different people. Tiny people with thin fingers have the best life. Food costs are lower and they can use smaller phones, among so many other advantages, not to go off-topic.So typing with fingers is only a last-resort emergency operation with this phone. The other typing option is a capacitive stylus. I\'ve found that to be dramatically better than fingers with Jelly 2, but still pretty bad. Once again, part of the problem is the software design of the OSK.There is are 2 other ways to input text though: handwriting and voice. I\'ve tested handwriting input with a capacitive stylus on Jelly 2 using Google Keep and Nebo. Basically it was a failure. No need to go into the details. It doesn\'t work. It works perfectly fine on any standard large phone even with a capacitive stylus, but the combo of small screen and coarse input of capacitive stylus makes this method unusable. Nebo is a very good app in general for drawing and handwriting input. I\'ve had good impressions using it on my Windows laptop/tablet, which has an active stylus. And it seems great on a standard large phone, but it was basically useless when I tested it on Jelly 2.So obviously the solution is an active stylus. I have always owned stylus phones, Samsung Note models and LG Stylo models. Active styluses are amazing, a total game-changer. They are incredibly precise and useful. The difference in usability between active and capacitive styluses is the difference between a sports car and a bicycle with flat tires. If Unihertz would make a Jelly model with active stylus, it would be worth any price they ask. I would happily pay double the price for that feature. It would completely transform the functionality of this phone. It would be a totally legitimate tool for text input.The same applies to Palm. If they released a model with active stylus, I would switch to that in a heartbeat. Given the niche status of phones like these, it\'s not likely these companies can profit from an even more niche product, but I think once people start to discover that these types of phones even exist at all, they could become very popular. I just learned that tiny phones exist last week. I literally had never heard of them before and never even thought about the topic, and I\'m a gadget-loving tech-geek type person who pays attention to a lot of things in the world. I really had no idea these phones existed. I suddenly had the idea one day that a tiny phone would be better because I really just want to do... the things I listed above. So then I went on the internet to look for tiny phones and discovered a whole new world, including all the cute, hilarious, cheap ""2G only"" micro-phones.ACTIVE STYLUS PLEASE!But there\'s another huge topic, which is voice typing. I never even tried that before, but I found it works great, like shockingly great. So for example, in Google Keep I can speak and see almost immediate transcriptions that are about 95% accurate in general, and the mistakes are pretty small and easy to ignore in most usage scenarios. It\'s a moderately mature technology. Unfortunately I don\'t think the technology is mature enough to handle the full variation in dialects that exist in the world. Just English alone has dozens of dialects with significant differences in pronunciation, so the voice recognition tech probably fails for a lot of people. I\'m lucky because I speak a common dialect of English, although I don\'t have cot-caught merger but Keep seems to, and I\'ve noticed some other failures on vowel recognition already in my brief testing of voice typing the past few days. I\'m sure I have a lot to learn about that topic, but the bottom line is that voice typing is a viable solution for text input on Jelly 2, which basically rescues this device. Without that or an active stylus, I\'m afraid I wouldn\'t be able to justify using this instead of a standard larger phone. While text input is a low priority in my usage goals, it\'s still moderately important.Congratulations to Unihertz for making an amazing product. The build quality is incredible. It feels like a premium device. It\'s beautiful and magnificent. I have high hopes for this as I find solutions on the software side--the whole experience of looking for apps and testing them is quite a nightmare and something I didn\'t really dabble in for my past phones. The phone did come with default built-in junk apps that can\'t be uninstalled, but a pretty small number and not a big deal. I found the solution is to use a third-party launcher/homescreen/icon customization app and then the icons can basically disappear.But given my usage, the inferior specs of the Palm phone are probably more than adequate and so I\'m still considering trying that in the future and switching. A major issue is actually the comfort in the hand, because if it\'s too thin it might be harder to hold. I\'m mostly holding the Jelly in between my 1st and 4th fingers (if you indexed them without the thumb). I\'m posting a photo of that there. I\'ve found that by far the most comfortable, and it doesn\'t block the microphone, but holding it in landscape mode has also been very comfortable and despite blocking the mic it would be better for typing if I could find suitable keyboard software. Hopefully this paradigm of tiny phones will catch on and then companies will offer more choices to suit different people with all their different preferences and hand sizes.ACTIVE STYLUS PLEASE!By the way, I\'m in the USA and already had a T-Mobile account. I simply swapped the SIM into Jelly 2 and it worked right away with no issues.UPDATE: I found that the red side button meant for customization is extremely valuable. It\'s absolutely perfect for screenshots and for the camera. It has 3 modes: short press, long press, double press. I haven\'t found a use for the 3rd one yet, but for screenshots and camera, a separate ""physical"" button is ideal. With the camera now, I can hold it very securely with one hand and take photos with the same hand very comfortably, 100% one-handed, which is difficult, almost impossible, for me to do with a regular sized phone and the touchscreen button on the camera app. I don\'t know to what extent physical side buttons like power and volume can be custom programmed to take photos on typical phones, but when it\'s a combo press of some kind it can be pretty awkward to use. With this single side button on the middle of the side, it\'s simply perfect ergonomics with one hand. For screenshots, it\'s a big advantage to have a button that isn\'t on the screen, and my past experience has been bad with a screenshot button on the bottom row as a 4th dedicated touch button alongside home, back and window navigation. It was bad because I often accidentally pressed the button, which was very close to its neighbor. Not a huge deal, just lots of accidental screenshots.But the red button doesn\'t work unless the phone is already on, so it\'s not especially useful for most purposes. If you have to press the power button first, then you can do almost anything just as easily with a normal touchscreen button. If you press the red button while the phone is off, nothing happens, so it\'s not a pure ""one button"" operation, but it\'s still extremely valuable for screenshots and photos.', '***Updated at 9 months: My opinion hasn’t changed at all; in fact, I only feel more strongly that this phone is AMAZING and WONDERFUL and a RELIEF from the heavy, big phones. It hasn’t let me down once. No regrets. I would buy this phone again in a heart-beat if something ever happened to this one. I cannot see myself ever going back to larger phones. There would be no reason to.SUMMARY: AMAZING. LITTLE. PHONE. So handy, functional, fast, high-quality, discreet, and attractive. Truly, no sacrifices have to be made. Why don’t more people know about this?PROS:-Great size: Easy to throw in purse or pocket or fanny pack-Nice resolution: Pictures look sharp and quality; easy to read screen for typing-Works with Verizon (YES IT DOES! Just follow the tips below; don’t believe Verizon)-Lanyard: Makes carrying the phone so carefree-Customizable in every way-Fast, functional, intuitive: You don’t have to sacrifice any of the things you’re used to having on a larger smartphone-Battery life: I use it heavily every day and it has a wonderful battery life. I do not stream videos or music, except for sometimes, but I do tons of texting, calling, reminder app-ing, and some internet searching. ***I get at least two whole days - sometimes almost three days - of battery life before needing to charge. That is holding true to this day – I have had this phone for 9 months now.-Customer service: Very responsive-Typing: Multiple ways to type; keyboard can rotate; I make fewer mistakes on this phone than my previous big smartphone-Dictation! Works perfectly! If you don’t like typing, then problem solved. I do this a lot!-Hotspot: Works great – I use it for my laptop at home and the speed is perfectly quick and reliable-Camera: Works great; pictures are crisp, sharp, and high-quality looking; camera is easy to use-Google Maps: Unbelievably convenient to have this great, popular GPS app on such a small deviceCONS:-Phone case: I really like the concept of the skin case (and it’s lightweight and lets you see the pretty green phone) but the only issue is that the case is not protective of screen side of the phone; the case stops below the edge of the screen side of the phone and so if you drop the phone on its screen side, the glass will be slap against the ground with no buffer.-Speakerphone might be a little quirky sometimes: Before I figured this out, the person I was speaking to (if I have them on speakerphone) would hear an echo of their own voice – I soon figured out that if you turn down the speaker volume to maybe just above the halfway, and not too high, then the echo for them goes away.-Vibration when calls connect: It’s not a big deal and I got used to it, but it seems unnecessary.-Messages app that came on the phone didn’t send/receive clear pictures; they were grainy pictures. I fixed this by changing to a different messaging app (Textra). Not sure why that helped!-Ejector tray for SIM card may be difficult to open. Obviously, you have to use the ejection tool but still I struggled to get the tray open. I almost couldn’t and I worried I was breaking something in the process.-Limited ringtones/sounds, but of course you can always download others.GENERAL:I’ve had such an incredibly positive experience with this phone. I’ve had it for 9 months so far and haven’t changed my mind yet. I’m almost 30 years old and so I’m in the group of people who have had small cell phones in the past and really miss them for their less-intrusive size/presence.I always preferred the qwerty keyboard from the slider phones I used to have, but alas you can’t find that anymore (I typed so much faster on those). But, this Jelly 2 phone does have essentially a qwerty keyboard (on the screen) that feels much closer to the size and ease of use as those old sliders; this is because the Jelly 2 screen is smaller so it makes the keyboard (when you rotate the phone longways left-right) feel just the right size for your thumbs. The Jelly 2 phone does the swipe texting/typing, which I really like. It saves a lot of time. I no longer rotate the phone and type with my thumbs because I’ve gotten used to the smaller keyboard when the phone is standing upright, but the option is always there. Also, there’s always the option of dictation! It’s so easy!The Jelly 2 phone can do everything a ""normal,"" larger smartphone can do. You can add any apps, you can remove many apps that came already on the phone. You can customize everything just like on a regular-sized smartphone. It was very easy to get used to the smaller screen size – after all, that was the size of screen we all had for a long time. Trust me, it isn’t hard to get used to the screen size or see/read the writing. Most/all webpages I’ve used have been friendly to this screen size and I’ve had no problems accessing web content or scrolling around pages; also, the zoom abilities are very convenient (with pinching the fingers, etc.). The phone is super-fast and functional (absolutely as good as the best larger smartphones out there); I have never felt that anything was sacrificed for the size/system.It has made me so incredibly pleased and happy to be able to throw this phone in my purse, my pocket, my fanny pack. It\'s so lightweight and small. I can whip this little phone out and can do anything I need to; then just throw it back in my purse/pocket/fanny pack/whatever, and you’d never know it was there. That means so much to me.The Jelly 2 phone came with all the Google apps including Google Photos. I personally prefer to use standard gallery apps, rather than Google Photos, so I simply downloaded one. I also chose a new reminder app (SimplestReminderPro) and it has been absolutely wonderful.There is a feature on this phone called App Blocker and it is I think the main place you can go for customizing the app running restrictions. You should experiment with restricting/limiting app running time so that you can conserve battery. I also disabled or uninstalled any apps that I wouldn’t use.It was important to me that Google Maps was on this phone - it works great! It shows you plenty enough (all you need to see), gives you heads up, and works beautifully. It works just like what you’re used to. How extremely convenient and useful to be able to have Google Maps on such a small device.I like the programmable button on the side (the red one). You can program a short press, two short presses, and a long press to do something automatically (like turn on the flash light, turn on the camera, take a screen shot, and the plenty of other things).My Jelly 2 phone kit came with a phone case, a lanyard, and two screen protectors. I LOVE the lanyard. It is the perfect companion to this phone. I just loop the lanyard around my wrist while I’m using the phone, and it is like a safety net in case I drop the phone. Also, it looks super cute to carry it on the wrist.***Here are the tips for making this phone work seamlessly with Verizon:I’m on a big family plan with Verizon. My SIM card was underneath my battery in my old phone, so I couldn\'t leave the phone on while I took out the SIM card (as some other reviews have stated that you need to). So, I turned off my old phone, took the battery out, took the SIM card out; then put the SIM card into the little tray in the Jelly 2 phone (which was also turned off). Once you get your SIM card into the Jelly 2 phone, turn the Jelly 2 phone on and go through all the setup questions/settings. You will need a wireless internet source in order to complete the setup; I used my husband’s phone’s hotspot. Once you get everything up and running, go in the Setting menu, choose the Network and Internet folder, click Mobile Network, and make sure that your 4G Calling is turned on. Right below the 4G Calling is the “Preferred Network Type” – make sure you set that to LTE. Also, it was easiest to retrieve all my old contacts from Google where they had always been backed-up while I was using my old phone.SUMMARY:I am blown away by this phone and am really grateful/relieved to have it - even still after 9 months I feel the same. It’s incredibly convenient and quick/easy to use. I get so many compliments on it; people, especially young people (which is a little surprising), really seem to want something small and handy like this and want to make the switch. Who wouldn\'t?? This phone makes me feel like I’m back in the “old” days when the phones were pocket-sized and they didn’t visually dominate your purse or your life. It’s nice to have something that does what you need it to do and more (i.e. doesn’t sacrifice any modern speed, quality, or capabilities) and yet doesn’t seem like such a heavy symbol of importance – both physically and metaphorically speaking. Sorry, but phones are not truly important in life, even though they are very useful. Phones do not equal happiness, self-esteem, or the only answer to boredom. It’s unfortunate that cell phones have evolved to be the large, dominating objects that they are. That’s where this Jelly 2 phone comes in. It’s discreet, handy, functional, and attractive. It can do everything you want and more. It has turned out to be a high-quality product. I wanted a phone that would match my minimalist lifestyle. The Jelly 2 phone is it, and I’m still so happy with it.', 'Design: ottimo, ha un bel colore è un suo stile. Risulta armonico e ben progettato.Peso: 110 grammi sono in effetti parecchi su uno smartphone così piccolo, ma bisogna dire che dentro ha veramente tante cose tra batteria da 2000 mah, sensore di impronte, jack audio per cuffie, infrarosso per usarlo come telecomando, nfc, gps etc.Qualità telefonica: ottima! Si sente bene dalla capsula auricolare e anche in viva voce dallo speaker è messo in basso. Dall’altra parte sentono bene la nostra voce. La ricezione è buona per non dire ottima, considerando le dimensioni del telefono.Batteria: bene ma non benissimo. Se lo usate in maniera moderata scaricherete circa un 8/10% all’ora,  che comunque vi consentirà di arrivare al pomeriggio inoltrato, accendendolo al mattino presto. Ovviamente conviene disattivare le connessioni se non servono il gps, nfc, Bluetooth tutto il giorno. Si ricarica abbastanza velocemente ma non troppo.Fotocamere: la posteriore da 16 megapixel effettua scatti apprezzabili in buone condizioni di luce. Al calar del sole o nel buio è meglio usare e scaricare la app di Google per i telefoni pixel… si trovano in rete gli app compatibili. La frontale può andar bene per videoconferenze, Viber etc.Processore, ram gpu: Tutto funziona molto bene senza impallamenti o rallentamenti. Gira qualsiasi app, anche quelle impegnative. La riproduzione dei video su YouTube arriva a 720p a 60 frame per secondo… non male per un piccolo schermo.Schermo: 3 pollici con buona risoluzione 800x600 circa. Non si vedono pixel. Lo schermo è un lcd ips. La qualità è mediocre, comunque accettabile. Per ora non ho avuto problema con alcun programma per essere eseguito e veduto su un oggetto così piccolo.Audio: buono in cuffia ma non potente… vi sconsiglio di usare cuffie entro i 32 ohm di impedenza. Sopra si sente un po’ basso. L’amplificatore interno fa quel che può. Comunque ottimo il poter usare cuffie con jack da 3,5 oppure Bluetooth oppure usando un d’accordo esterno su porta usb-c.Sensore impronte. Funziona bene. Bisogna salvare lo stesso dito più volte per aumentare la precisione. A causa della piccola dimensione del telefono è facile spostare i polpastrelli in maniera sbagliata e non fargli riconoscere bene l’impronta. In alternativa di può usare il riconoscimento facciale che funziona bene, e la sequenza numerica su schermo.Bonus: la porta infrarossi per usarlo come telecomando può essere un gadget utile. Il led di notifica rgb programmabile per messaggi email o quant’altro, la porta 3,5 per le cuffie e l’nfc per pagamenti elettronici.GPS: veloce preciso e affidabile.In definitiva…PRO: dimensione, leggerezza, qualità generale, versatilità di utilizzo. Ampia memoria e processore discreto. Molti bonus tra cui il, gps, nfc etc.Costo abbastanza contenuto. Bel design e colore intrigante. Tasto programmabile aggiuntivo. Buono speaker e ricezione telefonica gps, Wi-Fi e Bluetooth.CONTRO: fotocamere ok ma senza pretese. Batteria capiente, ma va ottimizzata meglio. Display lcd da 3 pollici con qualità accettabile ma non pazzesca. Chassis lucido e a rischio graffi e cadute. Usate sempre la cover in dotazione per proteggerlo. Prezzo forse un po’ alto per il prodotto.Bluetooth fermo alla versione 4.2. Pochi aggiornamenti software.VERDETTO: il migliore nella categoria compatti dal prezzo accettabile. Come secondo telefono o primo per disintossicarsi non male. Non fa rinunciare a nulla grazie a tutto quello che offre. Se dovessi migliorare il prodotto per fare un Jelly 3, amplierei lo schermo a 3,5 pollici e lo metterei amoled. Lavorerei un po’ di più sulla ottimizzazione tra hardware e software. Metterei un retro in vetro per aiutare la dispersione del calore e proverei a renderlo più sottile. Fotocamere migliorabili.Nella sua categoria ho visto di peggio. Il Palm phone che era disastroso per via della batteria minuscola… senza nulla e con poca memoria e prezzo altissimo.Altri prodotti cinesi, ma che hanno versioni Android vecchie e fotocamere e hardware ben limitato è peggiore.L’unico che trovo accettabile oltre al jelly2 è il Rakuten mini, che in Europa non è venduto. Bensì solo per il mercato asiatico.Spero di esservi utile.', 'Manca esim.....motivo no 5 stelleFingerprint non sempre precisaOttimo smartphone sulla da invidiare soprattutto per comodità trasporto in uso nonostante vetro parzialmente lesionato.Nel cassetto i ""padelloni""', 'Este telefono lo he comprado para substituir a un Sony xperia z5 compact con pantalla de 4.7 que me salió malisimo y ha muerto. El unihertz con una pantalla de 3"" es más grande que el sony de 4\'7. ¿ como es esto posible? En el sony la pantalla llega hasta los bordes y en el unihertz no, y el unihertz si bien es corto y estrecho es casi el doble de gordo, y el sony  ya era gordito para la epoca hace 6 o 7 años cuando salió. De peso segun las caracteristicas de los fabricantes el sony es 27 gramos más pesado (no tengo bascula) pero da la sensación en la mano es al contrario me imagino que porque el peso del sony se distribuye sobre mas superficie de la mano y es mas ergonomico, paradojicamente el mas pequeño es mas incomodo de coger.Solo llevo un dia con el telefono y lo he estado configurando por lo que lo he utilizado mas de los que lo suelo usar. Cuando lo encendi tenia 94 de bateria y en 3 horas de uso ha pasado a 25.Con el sony ya me parecia justita la bateria, vamos a mi me dura porque no lo uso, pero a nada que hagas algo la bateria vuela. Pues en  este unihertz es todavia peor ...Como digo en el titulo el telefono no es pequeño , de hecho es mayor en volumen que el sony y el sony tiene una bateria de 2700 y el unihertz de 2000.El sony es mas comodo de manejar por tamaño, tiene un lector de huella en un sitio mas comodo , tiene dos altavoces... en menos espacio.Cosas buenas del unihertz : tiene android 10, cargador usb-c que carga bastante rapido su minibateria, la pantalla para lo chica que es funciona sorprendentemente bien (vamos es incomoda que sea tan pequeña para escribir) viene con funda (un poco cutre la verdad), protector de pantalla (tambien cutre , al no llegar a los bordes das con los dedos en el filo y me imagino que acabara despegandose), el precio : cuesta 185 y el sony costaba 500 o 600 euros en su momento cuando salió.En resumen buena idea regular ejecución. El telefono es más pequeño que un telefono-tablet de los que se llevan ahora pero es mas grande que un telefono de 4.7 pulgadas de hace 7 años pero con una pantalla de 3"" que tiene bastante s inconvenientes de uso, el lector de huellas en un sitio incomodo y muy poca bateria. Creo que el telefono seria mejor con una pantalla mas grande y mas bateria. Mejora al sony de hace 7 años en la version de android y en que es relativamente barato. Y yo quería un telefono mas pequeño que el sony (este no lo es, solo la pantalla) pero tiene toda la pinta de que lo voy a devolver me ha decepcionado.Si tienes un telefono-tablet y quieres uno secundario mas pequeño o si no utilizas el telefono y quieres uno relativamente pequeño y relativamente barato que sea nuevo te pude valer, la verdad que no hay muchas opciones.... El tamaño de la pantalla es incomodo para escribir y la bateria vuela.Actualización despues de unos dias:EL diseño de la pantalla hacia fuera la expone a todo tipo de roces y que el protector de pantalla  incluido no se ajuste a los bordes lo empeora. Después de tener el teléfono un día y teniendo bastante cuidado la pantalla esta un poco levantada por un lado y tiene un arañón visible... sin haber estado en contacto con nada puntiagudo, ni el teléfono bocabajo. Ósea el protector esta para cambiarlo después de un día de uso increíblemente ligero y con cuidado … Definitivamente es un diseño pésimo. Intuía que podía pasar con el tiempo, pero me ha sorprendido siendo incluso peor de lo que parecía.En la parte positiva: si bien el lector de huellas es un desastre , el reconocimiento facial funciona bien y teclear una clave numérica es muy cómodo por ser la pantalla enana, apenas tienes que mover el dedo. La batería usando muy poco el móvil y seleccionando todas las opciones de ahorro de batería puede ser aceptable y se carga increíblemente rápido, en unos minutos. También destacar que el reconocimiento de voz a texto de Google funciona bien que puede ser una forma cómoda de evitar teclear en una pantalla tan pequeña.Después de la primera impresión pensé devolverlo, después pensé que aun con fallos me lo iba a quedar , porque realmente no hay alternativas de smartphones pequeños y funciona bien, pero finalmente creo que lo devuelvo. El protector de  pantalla y la pantalla están totalmente expuestos por el diseño del móvil, en dos días de uso ligero y  teniendo cuidado parece que han pasado años. Esta como para cambiarla y no me parece que tenga sentido estar cambiando el protector cada tres días o teniendo un protector con arañazos y con los bordes despegados...', 'This phone is really cute. It does the job even at half of most mobile phone sizes. This one has a 3 inch screen while many recent phones are now past 6 inches. I have strong eyes (for now), so, reading things on the screen is not problem for me. The lighting on the screen is bright enough and doesn\'t hurt my eyes when using it at the normal setting. I only wish this phone had a blue light filter for those who are sensitive.Apps run VERY well on this phone and the interface reacts well to my touch. It\'s pretty fast and very decent.If you have big fingers, I wouldn\'t get this phone for messaging, though. The keyboard reacts very well to my touch and it even allows me to swipe on the keyboard to make words.Sound on my calls are good and clear. Not super fine or HD quality sound, but, I can hear the caller on the other side very well. It is loud enough. Some reviewers said it sounds tinny, but, I disagree. It\'s not tinny. However, on loudspeaker, it IS. Even if I can hear music on its loudspeaker fine, it\'s not stereo quality (and it just has one speaker). So, don\'t expect Dolby-style sound like you would on your Galaxy S21. Some of the sound on certain YouTube videos aren\'t very loud, unfortunately and you won\'t be able to hear it well on this phone. I\'d say use bluetooth speakers or use a headset (hey it DOES have 3.5mm HEADPHONE JACK, so, there is HOPE after all, for many of us who PREFER a wired headset over bluetooth buds), but, you would probably say ""why? I would rather just get a better phone than that, then"". Well, okay, then. I ain\'t your papa. You do you, ok? The camera is standard, in my opinion. You can\'t expect super high Samsung quality photos on a small, albeit mighty, phone. Pics taken in low lighting aren\'t 100% great, but, it does a fine job, depending on your liking. If your kink is in photography, i don\'t think I would recommend taking pictures all the time with this phone. I do think unihertz has potential to up the ante on a better quality camera if they ever make a Jelly 3. Now, in terms of video quality...same deal. Average videos. Sound recorded is clear and adequate at best, but at worst, it sounds raspy.  Playing the videos I recorded with this phone on my 4K television was how I determined that. Recording at full HD res and with flash didn\'t do it much justice either. But, as far as I\'m concerned, it\'s still a hell of a lot better than what you get for with other phones costing under $200, although I understand POCO phones and Realme phones have much better camera and video quality at just below $300.Although, those are not the real beef I have with this phone. The real beef is the BATTERY.At 2000mAh, I mean...you gotta be kidding me. There are bigger phones with that battery size that lasts longer. If they equipped it with a 3000mAh battery, I probably wouldn\'t be complaining. The first 2 days I used my phone with all it\'s normal functions, apps, phone calls, etc., my phone lasted 7 hours at most. Luckily I always carry a powerbank with me, so I had to charge this little sucker up to full power, which took about 2 hours. So, not bad on the charging at this point.I used my phone in different settings just to see how I could extend battery life. First, I just kept refraining from using the phone unless I had to reply to a serious message or make necessary phone calls, and I would use a bluetooth dialer to answer any other phone call. That did work, but I managed to only gain an extra 2-3 hours of extra life. So, not very much help. Then I used the battery saver function, while using bluetooth dialer to make and answer calls. A little more decent. I just gained an extra 5 hours of life. That was the only upside, but, still, not at all pleased with the battery life of this phone. They could have given the phone a 3000 mAh and I would get a decent 16 hours of use, if not a full day.All in all, you get what you pay for. It\'s a cute phone. I won\'t deny that. I love it. I just wish that, while it is value for money, a lot more could have been done to this little gem. Better camera and video quality and stabilization as well, and a longer-lasting battery.', ""Vraiment top et très agréable à utiliser même en téléphone principal.Seul l'appareil photo ne m'a pas convaincu"", ""This is great as a second device when you're traveling."", ""Let me elaborate on the statement above. This device is £159 ( at the time of purchase) and at such a tiny size of 3inch, you'd expect a slow and barely useable handset with probably a cut down version of Android Go instead of the full version Android. You'll be sorely mistaken!This device comes with an Octa-core (8x) processor equipped with 6GB of RAM and comes with a full version of Android 10 out of the box with an already available Android 11 update once you set up your phone.Because of this, the screen is quite responsive and scrolling is quite snappy. This device is NOT slow. It's essentially a Mid-range Android handset that normally cost £500 but in a small package. One thing to note is that a lot of the mid range Android device tend to come with 3GB to 4GB RAM and rarely come with 6GB. The processor in this device might be about 1 or 2 years old but because it was a mid/high end processor back then, still makes it more than adequate for this device.If you're sick and tired of carrying 6.5+ inch devices then this might be your secondary phone or even a primary phone for you. You'll not miss out on your every day apps including banking apps etc plus you have NFC for contactless payments.Pros:- Dual SIM or 1 SIM and 1 expandable memory card but it already comes with 128GB internal memory.- Headphone jack!! (What did Samsung & Apple say about their big phones? Not enough space for a headphone jack?)- NFC, Bluetooth 4.2, IR Blaster (InfraRed so you can use your device as a remote control for TV etc)- Full Android 10 (to 11 after update) instead of Android Go so most of your standard apps are supported- 6GB RAM & 128GB internal memory giving it plenty of memory to even game!!- Mobile hot spotting, if I travel or go somewhere for a few days then I tend to carry my tablet so mobile tethering is perfect so If I need the big screen experience then I can always tether my Jelly 2 to my tablet.- The size of the device is just perfect. Although I think a 3.5inch might be the sweet spot with a slightly better resolution.- You get a silicone case plus screen protector (1 already applied on the screen and a replacement in the box). The silicon case also has a lanyard hole and box containts a wrist lanyard so you can easily tie it to your wrist.- Comes with a charging brick plus USB Type C cable! (Looking at you Samsung & Apple!)Cons:- Bluetooth 4.2 is good but should've had 5.0 & above which allows for multicast so you can connect 2 bluetooth headphones to 1 device so 2 people can listen to music on the same device (this feature is rare and not all Bluetooth 5+ devices support it).- The volume on bluetooth headphones or even when connected to your car is just too low. Connected this Jelly 2 to my Sennheiser HD 450 BT noice cancelling headphones and even at max volume on both the phone and the headphones, it still feels really low. It's equivalent of 50% volume on a Samsung handset. The same happens when connected to your car, you'd not only have volume at max on your phone but you'll potentially need to have it on max on your car too.- The fingerprint scanner rarely works. It rarely recognises my finger prints. I've tried numerous times to re-scan my finger print but it rarely recognises it so I rely on pin code but because the screen is so small, you can easily key the pin code with just your thumb and just as fast.- No IP rating so there's no splash or water resistance on this device so please be aware. Unihertz however does offer another device which is the Atom and Atom XL with IP68 that are built for rugged use but they're more bulky.Conclusion:If you're tired of the ever growing in size smartphones that we currently have or you're looking for a secondary phone without losing app functionality then this device might be for you. If you like going on night outs or travelling alot and don't want to carry oversized expensive phones that can potentially be lost or stolen then this might be for you. Phones are getting bigger these days but pockets are not! Funny enough, the smallest screen size that's offered by Samsung in their latest line up of phones (2021) is currently 6.4inch. This phone is 3inch!!!"", 'Llevaba mucho tiempo buscando un teléfono puntero pero de un tamaño contenido. Este podría ser un firme candidato, de hecho pensé mucho si lo devolvía o no.El teléfono se lleva en un bolsillo sin que moleste lo mas mínimo. El teclado pese a ser minúsculo es perfectamente utilizable sin necesidad de tener los dedos extremadamente delgados.Las aplicaciones convencionales corren sin especiales dificultades (no hablo de juegos) y el rendimiento global es mas que digno.También existe un surtido de accesorios aceptable.En el lado negativo tenemos una autonomia reducida (a muchos les costara acabar el dia), una marcada tendencia al calentamiento y un apartado fotográfico muy discreto.Es un excelente segundo telefono, pero no lo recomendaria como telefono principal a no ser que tus necesidades sean muy reducidas.']"

It\'s a solid device with great performance for $300. The battery life is respectable. My usage will get me about two and a half days out of a charge (mostly light gaming, reading, texting, and some music streaming).My last device was a pixel 3. In comparisons, the screen is good, but the colors are not as rich. The cameras performance is good, but not amazing. Full light photos are good with great detail and nice pixel saturation, possibly on par with my pixel 3. Low light situations are where it starts to fall off. Medium light is still workable with some tweaking of the settings and dialing in. Not too hard or consuming to do, honestly pretty easy. Low light, the pixel just wins. With some work, you can get passable photos with the N10, but not quite what the pixel can do. I dunno what wizardry Google does, but they kill it with their setup.Day to day usage, I\'m happy with the performance of the N10. The Oxygen OS is smooth and easy to work with, actually not really that different from a clean base Android. I appreciate that OnePlus is always updating and improving it. The processor is ample and there is plenty of RAM to keep things running fluidly. I\'m on Verizon, so I don\'t have 5g to be able to comment. That wasn\'t one of my requirements in the first place.The design and physical attributes are a mixed bag for me. It\'s a pretty thin design for what it houses. It\'s tall and  narrow, but the aspect ratio works for it. The hole punch screen is interesting to me. I\'m getting used to it and kinda like it. There is a setting that sets the margin of the screen to exclude it from the display area should you not like the appearance of it. I like the extra 4mm of display, personally. The physical buttons are responsive and give a good ""click"" feeling when pressed. My only complaint is how the volume keys are on the opposite side from the power button. I find myself taking accidental screen shots too often because of this. Again, it also shows that the buttons operate very nicely.All in all, I\'m happy with the performance of the OnePlus Nord N10. It\'s completely worth the asking price and has performance that would be worth a lot more in other brands flagships. To me, it\'s positives far outweigh the class. No regrets in my purchase as I would buy the OnePlus Nord N10 again.*Update 4/15/21* Still pleased with the N10. It\'s still a solid performer for the price. The only negative I have found is that sometimes the fingerprint sensor it a little twitchy. On occasion, it won\'t pick up my fingers. A quick screen off and back on or just unlock with pin entry.', ""Thing I like About the phone--Good amount of storage space-ConsI really tried liking this phone. After several months of really research to find a phone that fit my needs I decided to get this one after lots of comparing to leading brands. First off the touch screen sensor isn't always accurate. I find myself constantly repeatingly pressing the same keys just for it to register.I have to reboot the phone often through the day to get it to work properly to do simple tasks. Sometimes the phone drops cellular connections while I'm out and about and does the same while using wifi too. I have to disconnect and reconnect my wifi on the phone which is very annoying.Second- sometimes it's hard to get Bluetooth to connect to my devices like my laptop and earbuds.3rd- it doesn't load pages well like it should for it to have a high refresh rate 90hz. It's not as smooth loading as advertised. Can get laggy!!4th- the camera just downright sucks which I knew wasn't the best but man it's worse than expected compared to my old cheap Walmart phone. It's very fuzzy like an old Fashion tv that needs to use the bunny ear annetana to get an ok picture. If the lighting isn't bright it takes bad photos.5th- The charger can overheat too and the device gets hot at times ....like really hot when just using it for games like candy crush or bingo games.And lastly......people have a hard time hearing me while using the phone both on speaker and just using it up to my ear. I have to repeat myself constantly.I've done a trouble shooting with Amazon but nothing changed. I did factory reset and still same results. For it to be $300 phone it shouldn't have this many issues. My $100 Lg that I've been using for 4 years...its just a cheap Walmart phone and it blows this one out of the water in comparison. I feel very let down by this device since I really took 5 month of really hard looking, comparing and weighing out pros and cons for phones that I was really interested in. Amazon sent me some brand phone but other issues started up like freezing up, disconnecting from cellular connections and wifi,slow loading and bad fingerprint sensor. Believe me and other reviewers....this phone is definitely a step down from the PLUS ONE NORD 9 that I wish I got instead of this one but I'm on a budget and NORD 9 VERSION is a bit more that I can afford at the moment. I'll be returning this phone and going back to finding my phone that suits me and my needs and functional"", 'I\'ve been using Samsung since the Note 2.  Every iteration of Note or Galaxy since.  I broke the screen on my most recent galaxy and didn\'t feel like spending another $600-800 on the new unlocked model, so I looked into a cheap phone.  Man, I\'m so happy with this.  It comes with a case, a warp charger and cable, and I\'ve been so happy with it for the last couple months.  I use my phone a lot.  I\'m on it from 8AM, watching videos, streaming music, browsing IG, and I use it for GPS for an hour or so throughout the day.  I can go until 10PM before having to charge.  This battery is huge.  The LED screen is not as bright at all angles, but I look at my phone straight on, so that\'s not an issue.  Not as vibrant as my samsung screen.  The alarm clock was the hardest to get used to.  I got so used to Samsung alerts, this thing makes all different noises.  Hard to get used to after 9 years on a samsung.  The one complaint I have is the video.  I can\'t replay the videos I record in slow motion or scroll through the video.  Otherwise, the photos are okay, browser is lightning fast, no delays in IG, my phone reception is better on AT&T than my unlocked samsungs.  I do accidentally push the mute with my cheek while on calls, which shouldn\'t be happening.  It happens a lot.  Oh yeah, for some reason, One Plus makes the digit ""1"" on their clock on their GUI red, while the other numbers are white.  If you have any sort of wallpaper that\'s not black or white, you\'ll be confused and have to double take.  This is lame, and cannot be turned off easily without downloading stuff and changing things around with 3rd party support.  The phone charges really fast with their ""warp charger"".  From 15% to full in around an hour.  I\'m very amazed what kind of product I can get for half the price of a samsung nowadays.  We\'re at a point in time where lesser technologies have caught up to brand new tech, and the discrepancy between the two is minute, even tho on paper it looks extreme.  If the camera / video is not a huge priority to you (meaning you don\'t need the best of the best), buy one, you get used to it quickly.', ""I've had this phone since March. I wanted to let it really stretch it's legs before reviewing. As initial reactions don't paint a good picture of something you'll have for a few years.For $300 you get a lot of phone for your money. Using Mint Mobile and getting T-Mobile's 5G is what brought me to this phone. Connectivity is good but, I'm sure the network could be better. 5G is still very new.The Oxygen OS is very nice. A little bit of things you can't change but, I believe you could. I've not fully explored everything option. I feel you can do more to get how you like. Little bloatware but, there's some.Fingerprint sensor is annoying. I just found out after trying to unlock my phone while the screen is off, that you have to wake it up or get to the lock screen. So, I just shake my phone until I see the clock and then touch the sensor. Other phones weren't like this, so I gave it a low score.The screen is good, sound is good and is performance. Good, not great.How's it holding up? Great actually! I've had it slide in between the gap between the seat and the console and get under the seat in my car. A few scratches near the charging port. To be expected with plastic. Speaking of the body, it's not black with an iridescent glare like the photos lead you believe. The phone is blue. Not flat or matte and has a shimmer effect. Which is nice. Though, would prefer the black with the iridescent to be honest.Camera? Get's the job done. Uses some AI to clean things up. Not the worst thing but, it's nothing high end.Other than more updates, it's a good phone and fits the majority of what I need a phone to do."", ""I think this phone is much better than it's $300 price point might lead you to believe. 6GB/128GB plus MicroSD support up to 512 GB. A quick processor, 90Hz scrolling on a Full-HD screen with Gorilla Glass. 5G capable (Mostly on T-Mobile) with NFC and a headphone jack, plus a pretty decent array of cameras.  I'm a light user and I get 2 days of battery minimum, and the included Warp charger will take it from 25 to 100% in about 45-50 minutes. I believe Oneplus claims you can take it from basically dead to a days worth of charge in 30 minutes using Warp. That the charger is included shouldn't be taken for granted considering it makes for faster recover time, and also that certain manufacturers, such as Samsung and Apple, have quit including them on some models. I gave the fingerprint reader four stars instead of five because it doesn't often work for me. I didn't discount it more because  I'm taking into account my age of 62. As you get older, your skin becomes thinner and that makes it harder for scanners to read your prints. I've got scanners on a Galaxy Note 9, a wall safe, an exterior garage door opener, and laptops that are all glitchy and often don't work. The safe manufacturer actually warned buyers 50+ not to rely on the scanner. Your results may be different, particularly if you live in a humid vs. dry environment, health, etc. When it does work, I like the position on the back vs. the front, but that's just personal preference. The phone seems a little slick to hold on it's own, but that doesn't matter to me as I immediately put it in a clear, flexible plastic bump case for protection. I can easily do without wireless charging with the battery life and charge speed. I guess the one thing I wish it had was IP67/68 water protection, but you're not going to get everything under the sun for $300. Considering you could buy three or four of these for the same money as the latest flagship Galaxy or iPhone, maybe that's not so bad. I know those phone are faster, better cameras, flashier, etc., but all things considered, I feel really good about this purchase."", ""So i broke my expensive flagship Samsung phone...1,000+ dollars just gone...so i purchased the OnePlus Nord N10 5G as a temporary device until i could save up for a replacement Samsung flagship phone...and after a few days to get used to the (minor to me) differences, i realized i was almost as happy with this phone for 299 as i was with my 1,000 dollar phone...what!!...yep, 700 dollars cheaper and i was happy.There are a couple of differences that are important and i do feel the loss...The display isn't as good, it's 'good' but not 'phenomenal' like the Samsung's OLED display. For 700 in savings i can live with it.The OnePlus cameras are good, so much so that i don't notice the difference (except for a lousy night mode).I miss Samsung's UI 3.1, the Oxygen UI from OnePlus took me a few days to get accustomed to but now i zip through it and it works great.I miss the latest version of Android, OnePlus uses Android 10 in the N10 but i hear it's going to get Android 11...sometime...but hey, i saved 700 bucks.This is a great phone, no mistaking it for a 'super phone', but it does everything i need and a lot more. Sure i miss my pricey Samsung but not enough to justify spending the extra 700 dollars. Lesson learned.If money isn't an issue for you then go ahead and splurge on a flagship, but just know that the midrange priced phones are really great these days...go try one out and see for yourself. This one, theOnePlus Nord N10 5G is a worthy phone, one most people would be perfectly happy with."", 'I am glad to write review about this product. I found it a very nice and good product. This phone is light weight and battery backup is also very good.', 'Problems: 1. The wifi is constantly switching from source to source as I move around my neighborhood.  I pass government buildings that have public wifi near them and the local cable company has started providing free wifi that  I pass through on walks or bike rides.  (and yes, I have found and turned off the open network notification setting but it still notifies me and tries to grab the new wifi. This phone cannot decide which wifi it likes and will switch back and forth even if I\'m seated. The switches are not seamless, they are 30 seconds or so of total interruption to service, no wifi and no phone service, period.  When it switches the phone does not have data or LTE service.  It does not go to LTE between wifi sources.  If I turn wifi off, the phone loses cellular service as I move about, it seems to have the same issue of switching between sources.  Also, if I turn wifi off the phone still notifies me that wifi is available with the default notification sound (there is no way to turn this notification sound off, there is no related app, apparently the local cable company\'s self promotion ""free"" wifi service can override the phone with these pop-in pop-up ads for the (temporarily) free public wifi as I  move from block to block passing through the unlocked wifi sources which leads me to problem 2.  2. Notification sounds.  Set the default notification sound to None then set the sound for your texting app or else do what I did.  I went through each app and each apps multiple sub parts and picked through several levels of choices to change the notification sound to none.  I had the first OnePlus phone and swore I\'d never use them again because then they had 3 operating systems, Android, Cyanogen, and Oxygen.  The problem then was that the wifi did not work and the bluetooth did not work.  I recall that I rooted the phone and used just the base android which solved those issues but it was more frustration and a lot of time as my understanding of and interest in phones is small.  I bought this phone thinking it is always good to forgive and forget. Well, maybe not.  3.  A third problem I just recalled,  I was at home yesterday trying to put my passwords for myriad sites in order, upgrading passwords, eliminating duplicates, recording them in my password app, and so on.  I was challenged by various sites which were sending me texts. I got some texts but most were delayed or I was told my phone was not available.  One might not notice this in day to day use as some of the texts showed up later, not at all,  or out of order.  This was from different sources so the problem is my carrier or this phone. I tried my other cell lines/phones with the same carrier and they did not have the text dropouts/delays.  OTHERWISE, nice phone, good screen, pretty colors, nice sound.  If your fingerprint does not work well delete it and start over with the part of your finger that naturally touches the phone first, not the middle of your fingerprint.  The phone has trouble with fingerprints, it thinks the screen is dirty and it says it is going to record the edges of the fingerprint but it does not so if you start with the middle of your print you may end up without the corner of the tip that in actual use touches the reader first.', ""With a large screen that is very accurate and touch sensitivity responsive; a battery that last sometimes two days!, and a 30 minute WARP charge to full (using the included cable and wall plug unit); with 128mb internal and possible 1/2 Terabite micro SD expansion capability, this phone at this price (less than half what the replacement to my previous phone (S9) equivalent, this phone is incredible.  64mb cameras with slow speed or ultra high speed photography do great pictures.  The finger print reader is in a logical spot and responds VERY well.  The only issue I had is that being in Canada we had only 2 options for 5G coverage.  The service now up and running is lightning fast but not cheap (180 mo 2 phones with 60GB data- Telus.  Being seen as a major competitor the One Plus brand is not carried by our carriers in Canada and they were not helpful in getting it set up; however, once I discovered One Plus' customer blog/boards the solution was simple and just required an APN rewrite - that the phone company seemingly did not know about. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone wanting to pay less and still have a lot of high end features.  The phone is very slim, and light, so I bought an armour/armor case for it, and a high tempered glass screen protector to best protect my new favourite gadget!"", ""Been happy with this phone overall.Some notes:**5G is limited to T Mobile only. I have an AT&T-based MVNO (Consumer Cellular), and 5G connectivity doesn't happen. Potential for that to change, but nothing announced as of now. 4G is decently fast, so no complaints there.**Twice this week, my phone would stop charging if it got hot. Once was in direct sunlight in the car, so I directed AC vent at it, and charging resumed. Other time was at home, phone on top of hot laptop. Moved it away, charging resumed a few minutes later after it correctly led down. This is the first time I've owned a phinicky phone that pauses charging if it thinks it's overheating. Guess it's good, there just wasn't any alert or warning it was happening.Warp Charging is faster than old Dash Charging, but since this battery is larger than my old OnePlus phone, the percentage increases look like they are less off hand.Battery life has been good, a few times it seemed to drain faster than expected, fixed by killing some vampire apps.At $300 or less, this phone at least deserves a look. Solid phone, just wished 5G was available on all US carriers now.""]"

If you want a cheap, no-nonsense Android phone for calls, texts, everyday apps, etc., this is a fine choice. If you ever intend on taking a picture, steer clear; photo quality is genuinely 2006-level terrible, albeit high resolution. But high resolution junk is still junk.

That was followed by a v3 razr (only a couple weeks on a charge) when everybody went to 3g.  I moved to a rural place that at&t (the last provider with 3g) did not cover, so I got an android phone (LG).  It was ok but the radio wasn\'t sensitive enough.  I put a  booster on the house which helped at home but it was annoying at other places to not get a signal when others around me from the same provider were getting 2 bars.  I really liked flip phones for easy storage, so when gen 2 of this phone showed up I was interested.I waited until gen 2 because the reviews of gen 1 indicated it needed some engineering refinement.  I waited until the 2022 version came out so the price would drop to what I\'m willing to pay for a smartphone.  I read a lot of reviews and decided I would go for this one - the big draw was Motorola hardware.  I\'ve been a ham radio operator for decades and Motorola has always made top notch radios for many industries.  They\'re usually commercial units and too expensive for hams, even second hand.  They have a long standing reputation for producing sensitive, low noise radios.BUT, my big mistake was reading a few reviews about not buying from a third party, as they came used, so I bought one directly from Motorola instead.  Their web site is the worst I\'ve ever experienced for buying from a desktop computer.  As you progress through the steps of personal info, shipping address, payment, etc, sometimes the site gets stuck and won\'t progress.  It gets stuck if you 1) use autofill, 2) tab to go to the next field, 3) select the ship to same address checkbox.  I tried this on a windows 10 box, Linux Mint box, and Linux Raspian box (please don\'t laugh).  All problematic and no success.I tried once again on a windows 10 laptop and typed every character, used the pad to move the mouse pointer to each field each time, double entered my address and the shipping address, then discovered my credit card was denied.  Why?  Because even though I never finished my purchase, they tried to put 4 pending charges of the same amount on the card, so my credit card company sensed a scam and disabled the card.  I tried one more time with another card and it went through.  The next day I had fun on the phone getting the first card re-enabled.The phone arrived quickly but it was the wrong color.  I didn\'t even open it.  Their customer service is in India and I had language issues when I explained I wanted to return it for the correct one.  I was passed from department to department with no resolution.  2 days later I  was contacted by an American agent who took an hour to determine that yes, they were able to do an exchange but he had to check inventory.I called customer service the next day (in India) and arranged for a return and a refund - something they had a ""path"" for.  They sent me a mailing label via email and I mailed it back the next day.I then bought one from Amazon.  It arrived 3 days later.  It\'s operation is a little different than other android phones and if you\'re used to a glass screen it will seem a little odd, but functionally it\'s exactly the same.  What other reviewers said about it being slippery is true.  Never ever set it down on a non level slick surface like wood or plastic or glass, because it will start to slide, guaranteed.  It\'s sturdy and survives drops, like an original razr.  The flip feature is really great because it\'s easy to stow in a pocket without being damaged.  I do not use a case.  What do I like best?  The RADIO.  I now get 3 or 4 bars where others get 2 bars.  Motorola also is known for robust hardware, and this phone is heavy and solid.  The sensitive part - the touch screen - is protected when folded.  The front screen and back are glass.  I still have to learn the front screen well, but it does indicate who is calling so I know before I flip it open to answer.  I could go on - it\'s a great phone for making phone calls, texting, pics, etc.  Don\'t know about gaming.  It\'s not the most bang for the buck you can get but the build and radio make it worth it for me.Now, back to the plot:  a day later I get a call from Motorola customer service saying they don\'t have one in inventory but would offer me 10% off to keep it.  I ignore it.  Two weeks later I get an email from Motorola saying my case was closed.  What?  I call, and after a long phone tree/wait/have one agent call another wait/for almost 2 hours, they find out that whoever logged it in copied the number wrong and it wasn\'t linked to my account.  Don\'t they have a scanner?  I was still being charged on the second card.  They finally figured it out, and it took them another hour to make it right.  The charge was cancelled just 2 days shy of when the bill was due.Although their customer service agents are always polite and helpful, the processes they have to follow really suck.  It must be a terribly frustrating job for them.  One hand doesn\'t know what the other is doing at Motorola.  Great engineering.  Don\'t have a clue how to handle the customer experience.  This is not the fault of the workers or the divisions, this problem belongs to the CEO.  That person has not set up the organization so there is a person/department responsible for the customer experience.  Maybe all they are good for is the dealer experience.  Seems like they make mountains out of mole hills.A couple days ago I got another email saying my case was closed.  They always ask me to reply if there\'s a problem or concern, but it\'s subject line includes ""no-reply""  Sheesh!Long winded, yes.  Don\'t make my mistake.  DO NOT BUY FROM MOTOROLA DIRECTLY.  Buy it here.  If you don\'t like it send it back.  No hassle, no problem.  Mine arrived in perfect condition and I really like it.  Folded, yes, but that\'s factory.  Protects the plastic touch screen.  The box is made for it to be shipped that way.  No crooked label on front.  Obviously new.  Yes, I can see a little hinge fold and non flat lines as others have complained about.  Doesn\'t mean a thing for me.  Operates the same.', 'UPDATE 6 MONTHS LATER=====================OK so I still like this phone, HOWEVER I have always had issues where I cannot reliably get SMS texts. Initially I thought it was a T-mobile coverage issue, but I am starting to think it is something with this frigging phone! I noted recently that if I turn OFF my Wifi, the SMS text reliability issue goes away and I can get text messages even in poor coverage areas. Anyone else experiencing this issue where you have to turn off WiFi to get SMS texts reliably?It was time to replace my 3 year old, unsupported, Huawei Mate SE phone, with something capable of 5G and a later version of Android.I initially bought a renewed Moptorola One 5G Ace, but battery life was not up to par, and despite being told it could be unlocked, I was unable to. I had T-Mobile (and Sprint) try many times and they could not unlock it. So, for $100 more went with a new, totally unlocked one instead.So far I am happy with this phone. The most annoying thing I encountered is the SIM/Memory tray is an utter pain in the ass to work with. The SIM does not snap in properly in the tray and it took many tries to get the SIM and microSD RAM to slide into the phone properly. Several times the SIM popped out and went flying across the room. Eventually I got it to work. That was the same situation with the first Moto One 5G Ace I received as well.Transferring data from the old phone was a breeze using Android\'s phone-to-phone transfer mechanism, or you can use the Google backup from the cloud. Note that the latter (cloud restore) does not transfer your message history, which I believe is a feature Google does offer, but for a fee.PERFORMANCE - The Moto One 5G Ace uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G chipset, which is not the fastest or latest out there, but it powers this phone just fine. With 6GB of RAM and 128GB built-in storage, it is more than sufficient  compute horsepower for the average or even a power user. Apps load quickly, perform well, and I have had no issue with multiple of apps all open and flipping between them. The user experience is snappy and smooth. Storage is 128GB and expandable to 1TB using an extra microSD chip.SOFTWARE - The phone comes with Android 10, and minimal bloatware loaded, which is nice. Not sure but it seems there is no upgrade path for this phone to Android 11 which for some, is a show stopper. It runs all my apps just fine and nothing I use has failed or crashed on the phone thanks in part to Android 10 being an exceptionally stable OS.DISPLAY - It has a nice big 6.7"" 2400x1080 FHD+ display which is reasonably bright. Some complained about the screen intensity in bright ambient light, and while you DO have to crank up the brightness to full in sunlight, it is still readable. It does wash out a bit in bright sunlight though, more than my old Huawei did, but not enough to be a major issue for my usage.BATTERY - The One 5G Ace has a 5000 mAh battery, bigger than many phones in this class. So far battery life has been good. It charges up quickly, and a full charge is lasting well into 2 days of average phone use.ERGONOMICS - The phone feels good in your hand, and has a good weight to it. The back is crappy plastic, and without a case, it is actually easy to slip out of your hand, but I always use a rubber case, which solved that issue. The fingerprint reader is in the correct location on the back allowing you to easily tap it with your index finger.CAMERA - The phone has several lenses which deliver reasonable photo quality, but not to the level you would get on a more expensive phone. The camera capabilities in this phone are somewhat lacking, thanks to using cheaper lenses.  If you are a photographer looking to use your phone for real photography, this is not the phone for you. If you are the average user that periodically uses the phone to document how your mower came apart, taking the odd video, shooting pics of your dog, then it is just fine.NETWORK - The phone supports 5GHz WiFi which is a nice to have that I did not have on my old phone. It also supports tethering via WiFi or Bluetooth (useful if using a Tablet or PC on the go). On the Cell mobile network side, it supports 5G, but I have noted some issues with this. Occasionally when sending texts they do not transmit. I found that turning off the 5G support seems to solve that issue. This may NOT be anything to do with the phone, and everything to do with 5G coverage on the T-Mobile network.CALLS - Something many ignore on a PHONE these days, since this is what a PHONE is supposed to do. Audio quality is actually pretty good on this phone - you do not sound like you are talking through a tin can. It also supports WiFi calling which is a nice to have if you are like me and use a plan that has a limited number of minutes, you can push some of those calls off to WiFi if you are on your home network. Android 10 also supports some features I did not have before on my Huawei, like Google\'s call screening service and better management of Contacts.GPS - The GPS works well, locks-on rapidly, and supports tracking of multiple different GPS satellite networks, including GPS, A-GPS, GLONASS, GALLIEO, LTEPP, and SUPL. A key reason I dumped my Huawei is the GPS stopped working (possibly due to some software update) and it is impossible to get proper support on Huawei phones in the US.SENSORS - The phone has a Fingerprint reader, Proximity sensor, Accelerometer, Light Sensor, Gyro, e-Compass, Barometer and Near Field Chipset (NFC). The latter was missing from my old phone, so now I can use my phone for payments again.SUMMARY - In summary this phone offers good value for the price. I will post periodic updates to this review as time goes on.', 'From the original MicroTAC, I\'ve had a thing for Motorola flip phones. I upgraded from the MicroTAC to the StarTAC, the original RAZR, a KRZR... it wasn\'t until the iPhone that I abandoned poor Motorola. So, seeing an Android resurrection that not only looked like a RAZR but also had 5G was something I couldn\'t pass up. Especially after parting with my Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, because I was sick of needing to adjust my pocket every time I got in to my car.After a few days in though, I might have to pass it up.The phone itself is beautiful, though my wife noticed it charging and asked what I was doing with a new Blackberry. Indignant, I told her it was a RAZR, and she laughed. Be cautious if you think you\'re making a fashion statement with this phone.I was apparently blessed with a phone that doesn\'t creak. The only noise you hear when opening or shutting it is the ""clap"" when the phone shuts. I had forgotten how much I missed hanging up by closing the phone.The internal display has surprisingly vivid color reproduction, and you don\'t really notice the curve or underlying bumps after a few seconds. However, you definitely notice the tactile differences when using the screen, and I found that some areas of the screen need a slightly forceful push where most glass screen phones are tappable. You\'re not going to mistake the screen for the 120Hz 4K OLED / AMOLED planks on flagship phones, but unless you\'re the type to constantly scroll back and forth through your apps to behold the majesty of your refresh rate, you probably won\'t feel like you\'re missing out.On the other hand, the narrow display does feel like a bit of a throwback. I\'ve grown used to setting Chrome and Edge to request desktop versions of sites, and found things like news sites to be unreadable without constantly zooming in and out. When I changed the setting to fetch mobile sites by default, the RAZR 2020 felt a lot like the RAZR V3 pulling WAP sites from the long, long ago.The camera is... well, you get a camera. It isn\'t potato-cam bad. It\'s good enough that Surface Duo owners would be rightfully jealous. It\'s fine for simple snapshots that you\'re never going to crop and enlarge. I could get by with it, and if I had to choose between Samsung\'s beautify filters that can\'t be turned off and a comparatively low-res RAZR photo that looks normal (if a bit grainy), I\'d probably go the RAZR route. But if I was looking for something as a content creator or had any photographer inclinations, I\'d be sad with what the RAZR\'s camera is capable of.A bright spot is the 5G connectivity. I\'m on AT&T, and they\'ve chosen to whitelist devices for 5G access. Fortunately, that includes the RAZR. I\'m not sure if it\'s materials or antenna placement, but the RAZR pulls a much stronger 5G signal with higher bandwidth than my Note 20 Ultra or S20+. And because 5G isn\'t fully built out in the places I usually go, I definitely appreciated how the RAZR will give up on a bad 5G connection and flip to 4G where the Samsung phones will cling on to 5G for dear life -- so much so that I regularly use an app on the Samsung phones to disable 5G (for anyone not on AT&T, the built-in function for this is disabled on unlocked Samsung phones when you use an AT&T SIM).But for as good as that 5G/4G management is, Motorola (er... Lenovo, since it\'s really Lenovo now?) chose not to bake that intelligence into the wi-fi management. Most devices I have will happily find and use whatever the strongest signal is, but the RAZR doesn\'t want to let go of a wi-fi network until it disappears from rangeNow... let\'s talk about the processor. I really went back and forth on the RAZR because it\'s a very expensive phone for something packing a Snapdragon 765G. Even when Amazon discounts the phone by hundreds of dollars (as they have at the time of this writing), I\'m not sure you can find a phone teetering on the edge of four figures that doesn\'t have an 865 or 865+ SoC. And while Google has managed to squeeze every single drop of performance they can out of the 765G in the Pixel 5, the RAZR still feels pokey even when compared to the Pixel 3 and the 845 SoC it contains.I don\'t know if that\'s because Android 11 makes better use of the 765G, or if it\'s just good old Google magic that makes the Pixel 5 seem mostly as good as a current-gen phone, but even three year-old games like Sonic Forces: Speed Battle choke the RAZR. Even with all other apps killed and Gaming Mode enabled. Not a gamer? Okay, Outlook absolutely chokes if you have multiple large inboxes. I don\'t really consider myself a ""power user"" compared to people who are making and editing 4K videos on their devices in between CoD matches, and I\'m telling you for basic games and heavy-ish business use, the RAZR feels underpowered relative to midrange phones from two or three years ago.On a similar tangent, I\'m a little concerned about getting updates from Motorola. We\'re coming into the middle of November, and my RAZR is happily plugging along on the August 2020 security patch. No updates came out of the box. No updates have been offered when I\'ve done manual checks. No updates on wi-fi, no updates when plugged in. No updates after rebooting, changing the calendar, or slowly chanting ""Hello, Moto..."" Even stranger, the carrier-branded versions seem to have updates as recently as October.Not surprisingly, battery life on the RAZR isn\'t awesome, either. The first day I got it, I wasn\'t very surprised that it wanted to be charged after about 6 - 7 hours. I\'d been installing everything, doing lots of stuff with the internal display, and testing everything I could. But even on days when I\'m just checking mail and making a few calls, getting a full day out of the RAZR is about the best I can do. If I was going on a road trip or had an emergency pop up at like 10:00 p.m., I\'d be pretty nervous if I didn\'t have a car charger or power bank at the ready. You expect that with a phone this size, but that kind of battery life was what prompted me to replace my Pixel 3 XL after two years of heavy use had diminished the battery life.Would I recommend this? Probably not to most people -- especially anyone who does more than simple phone calls and texting. Yes, the pocketability is a straight up joy that I\'ve missed for a very long time. Yes, the external display works really well for banging out quick messages and checking your texts and notifications. But once you ask the RAZR for more, it just can\'t deliver.', ""Arrived on time and while the packing job had in my opinion insufficient protection, the actual device retail box was only a little dinged up and the phone was in pristine condition.Wanted a new phone but didn't want any Android OS after Android 10. Did a bunch of research and thankfully this only updates from Android 9 to 10 and no further. Just what I wanted, other features are also good.Works fine on T-Mobile.Pros:- Build quality and materials feel very premium, looks fantastic- Updates stop at android 10 and still works great- Camera works very well, photos and video come out great- Screen is very clear and bright- Lots of battery for activities and such- Flashlight is bright- Under screen fingerprint reader works surprisingly well even with screen protector- Has headphone jack- Speaker sounds great- Call quality is good- Moto gestures are really nice, I really like double chop for flashlight- Works fine with my desired launcherMinor nitpick(not really even a con):- Surprisingly volume doesn't get as loud as I'd hoped(Headphones or internal speaker). Still loud enough though."", ""I always liked moto phones for 2 reasons, amazon payment plan and the special features that only moto phones have. The shake flash light on/off is my favorite when it works.When I bought this phone 2/2022 it was supposed to be receiving android 12. This yr, it was updated to Android 11 and recently read that it will no longer update to 12 nor will I receive security updates. I don't mind the OS not being updated even though I bought it specifically for that reason, but Motorola should not be allowed to sell phones they are no longer updating or at least be required to list that the phone will not. What a waste of $$. Sry Moto, I can no longer trust your false promises you lost a customer.If you do not care about security updates and don't want to spend a lot then moto is the way to go but I would never spend hundreds again on this co."", 'By gesture driven, I mean there is no traditional ""home"" button.  At first this threw me off because I have had either Samsung or Blackberry phones for my cell phone needs for years.  I stopped buying carrier locked phones a long time ago and only buy unlocked.  This being due to limitations preset on phones by carriers and bloatware as well as slow update rollouts.With no home button, it takes some limited getting used to, but there is a homescreen Moto app that trains the usage very well.  Basic swipes for what you want to do, and most if not all are able to be done one handed.  That seems to be the goal here.  One neat feature that impresses those who have seen me do it, is the double chop gesture that turns the flashlight on or off.Battery life is the BEST I have had in any cell phone.  I work overnight and sometimes use my phone to stream Youtube or Broadcastify as I work.  Never in a 10 hour day, even streaming, has the battery been lower than 81%.  That tells me that 2 days is an easy get for battery life, especially if not streaming etc.The camera is solid.  It offers to switch to night mode or macro mode if the sensor sees that may be better, but lets you decide.  I like that.As to data transfer from my old phone, I used the intuitive Moto app to do this.  It came up on first start.It transferred all but a few apps, because they were unsupported old apps or based on Samsung specifically as my old phone was a Samsung 9+. I did have to sign back in to apps, but that is okay.  That is with all such transfers, even within the same family of phones.It is slightly heavier than the Samsung 9+, but has a solid feel.One side note that is a con for me, but not a deal breaker.  This phone does not do wireless charging.  One must use a type C cord.  Of course it comes with a cord, but it is a very common type right now if one wants to buy aftermarket ones that are longer.As I liked the stand charger I used with my old phone, I came up with a solution with an Amazon product.A stand https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B2WNNB2This stand allows the cord to drop down from the phone and stand up without overbinding the cord.  As my phone is my alarm clock, this is a great way I figured to do it.Do get a case for the phone. The one I got was suggested when I purchased it and is called Osophter for Moto G 5G.  I like the case.  Simple and buttons are not blocked or hindered.5G. Yes, it will do 5G where it is available.  I do get 5G in most places I go.  Where there is not 5G it seamlessly switches to 4G or even 3G and in settings there is a option to allow 2G for apps to stay connected.  Helpful for rural mapping.The android system is seamless as well.So, in closing, I do think this is a VERY good phone for anyone looking to buy unlocked and is not brand loyal to other makers.  Motorola is a solid maker.  Hello Moto. Remember that?Update: January 8, 2022I have been using the phone extensively since I purchased it and can not be happier.  It is a good as the day I bought it.  Battery life is still stable and shows no depletion of charge from purchase.  With the case I bought, it has protected it.  I have dropped it more than one time on tile floor and no damage has resulted.  It has gotten moist from rain.  Nothing happened. 5G is still rolling out and choices that are not exploitive in price are limited.  Enter this phone.  Reasonable price, unlocked and simply works well.', 'TL;DR before I get started: Good phone, but competition at $400 makes it a 🤔 purchase. At $300 though? Banger.Do you like the blisteringly fast performance of flagship phones? Do you like the feeling of your hard earned money reflected by premium glass in your hands reminding you that you dropped 800 bones plus tax? Do you loathe headphone jacks and expandable storage because it\'s a ""dying feature"" holding back the future? Well too bad, schmuck! You get none of that. Instead, yous gettin\' a midrange fighter that could be argued on price, but still performs admirably. Unless you got it on sale for $300 like I did, in which case you got a steal of a phone, even compared to others in the price range. If you spent $400, well....to be honest, I\'d have gotten something else. But never mind that! You got what you got, and what you got is quite serviceable.Somewhat detailed breakdown across the board, and I\'ll start with the obvious. Mainly, Motorola\'s abysmal update department. Whereas other phones give you maybe some years of guaranteed software updates, Motorola kicks you out at 18 and says you get one care package. Now for someone like me who roots their phone day one on delivery, this is whatever. But for those who don\'t, this blows. It\'s almost like they WANT you to root the phone and void the warranty by not offering future updates. Why.Maybe you\'re wondering about the hardware and software. Well, minus the cameras being only okay, which does kinda bite, you\'re getting a quick Snapdragon 750G, which SEEMS to be on par with the 765 in the Samsung A71 5G. With the 6GB Ram variant (which is the only one you SHOULD be getting), you have enough room to enjoy a smooth, fast experience, which may or may not be what she said. However, with the 5000mAh battery, you\'ll be going without a charge for quite some time, which is what you WANT her to be saying. Idk, YMMV. And charging is pretty quick. Gaming is a breeze for most titles that I\'ve played, so you shouldn\'t have too much trouble if you like to game on the go. And since Motorola is dedicated to the idea of a (mostly) pure Android experience, your OS is a bloat free experience, which is nice.Design wise? The waterproofing could be better. It\'s really raindrop repellent if anything, but I\'ll take it. The display? Well, it won\'t be breaking any records, especially since it isn\'t AMOLED, but it\'s bright enough. And tbh, this phone isn\'t small. Now, I have long, lanky hands, so this isn\'t much of a big issue for me, but for those with smaller hands, you\'ll probably be asking yourself why you bought this. The answer? MORE PIXELZ, BAYBEE. The plastic? Your mom\'s 93 Corolla has plastic all across the frame and that\'s been in more accidents than most of us have had during potty training and survived. Plus, who isn\'t buying a case with your phone these days? What are you, a daredevil? However, whoever put the speakers where they put them, I want to have a conversation.If we were to look at it on paper, you\'re only getting this for the battery life and the bloat free experience. For some of us who don\'t care about an amazing camera, that\'s more than enough. But when this phone is on sale, it\'s an amazing buy. It\'s quick, it\'s long lasting, it\'s a good enough addition to the Moto family. It\'s just not worth $400.But in a world where expandable SD storage, amazing battery life, and 5G capabilities are a plus on a phone that performs well, maybe it is worth the $400...?', 'It is a good phone however its OS is a bit cumbersome. Was upgrading from Samsung to a 5G phone. It would have been a keeper had not been for the OS, a bit cumbersome and not as intuitive as the Samsung. Return it after a week of trying to get used to new OS. If you currently have a Motorola I am sure the transition would be transparent however, if you are upgrading from a different make smartphone get ready for a considerable learning curve', 'This review is based on ATT user experience. A friend with T-mobile service bought the Motorola One 5G Ace and highly recommended it. Amazon reviews for ATT use were mixed but I decided to buy it ($210) for an older relative. The phone was unlocked. I put in an ATT sim card, followed the setup step, was up and operating in minutes. I have been messing with the phone for 3 days now. Will update if things change.--5G – the phone came with Android 10. Data connection showed ATT 5GE, which really is ATT’s 4GLTE Advanced. A day later, I received a notice to update to Android 11 + Security Patch 03/01/22.  After that, Security Patch 05/01/22 followed. Then Security Patch 07/01/22 followed. Now data connection shows true 5G. The update also enabled ATT Wifi Calling. See pictures.--SCREEN - very clear, bright and vibrant. My regular phone is Samsung 22 Ultra. Compare to the 22, the Ace 5G has a slight blue tint but still very gorgeous. See pictures.  I have a glass screen protector on but the screen is still very responsive to touches.--PERFORMANCE - I am not a heavy user, but the Ace installed all apps from Google Play Store without problems. No problem with side-loading apps. RAM was enough for switching among apps, no app reloading, lo lag. The multiple tabs in Fire Fox did not have to reload/refresh. Graphic was clear without lag when playing light games like Real Steel Champions or Clash of Clans.--FACE UNLOCK - responsive and accurate. Like all other phones, this may work well under very low light conditions.--FINGER UNLOCK - seems very reliable, even slightly dry or wet skin. Unlocks the phone in a fraction of a second.--HARDWARE - a relatively heavy phone but feels very solid. The plastic back seems a bit cheap but with the case on, who cares?--SOFTWARE - pretty basic without much bloatware. Could be a good or bad thing. If you like to customize your phone, then you will need to down additional apps.--CALL, MESSAGING, BLUETOOTH, SOUND - I did not experience any problem making calls, no static, no disconnect, etc. No delay or loss of messages.  Paired, connected and reconnected to bluetooth devices without problem. Speaker was pretty loud.--CAMERA - I am not a Pro but I think the pictures and videos are pretty clear. The Night Vision is a plus when taking pictures in low light conditions.--BATTERY – pretty impressive. I am not a heavy user. After 48 hours from a full charge with regular uses like email, youtube, games, internet news, messaging, phone calls, app, etc., I still have 41% battery.--GLITCHES – the screen became unresponsive once when I was trying to turn off an alarm. Another time, the screen auto dimmed in daylight. However, pushing the power button off then back on cleared that.Overall, I think this is a great phone for the price paid.']"

I have used it for more than a day without having to recharge.', 'Personally  I wasn\'t ready to buy a new smart phone.  My 2016 Samsung J series phone as far as I was concerned continued to meet my needs as my basic everyday cell phone.  However, my cell phone provider informed me that my older 3G version CDMA phone was no longer to be supported by T-Mobile/Sprint and I was left with no choice but to find a replacement.  I use Tello which is an MVNO cell phone service .  I  pay around 12.00 a month for unlimited call/text service and 1 GB\'s of fast data. The rest of the data I get free via WIFI or Hotspots.  Consequently, paying much more than $100.00 for an unlocked phone seemed out of the question for me.  I\'m so grateful that I selected this Moto E  (2020) phone and I think you will too.  This budget phone came the closest to meeting all of the objectives I laid out and still kept me within my overall  $100  price range.  Maybe off by just a little bit... LOL.  As you will soon see  I\'m a researcher by profession.  It literally took months for me to evaluate budget cell phones as I didn\'t want to switch my cell phone provider.  However, If I did switch providers the Moto E (2020) gave me the most choices in choosing a new phone service versus any other budget phone sold out there in the market..  Basically  I needed a phone that was VoLTE friendly and this phone is DUAL VoLTE friendly.  I needed a phone that supported bands 66 and 71.  Only this budget phone met that category in (GSM) and yet offered full (CDMA) compatibility as well.  Budget phones for Samsung, One Plus, TCL , LG, Nokia, BLU, Oukitel  etc...  all of them failed miserably at the  $100 price range let alone not offering the same number of frequency bands as the Moto E.  Why then only 4 stars ?  Sadly, this Moto E phone has an antiquated  slow charging Micro USB adapter. ( SEE PIC ) This phone uses an LCD screen and the resolution display is adequate but not exceptional.  Any senior whose used to pressing front and back arrows instead of swiping to change pages will find that difference annoying .  Overall, it just takes some time getting used to it.  However, on the positive side the phone is BIG.  The screen is Easy to Read.  It has a modern slim bezel more like an expensive upper scale smart phone. (SEE PIC)  Although the phone is big , it\'s still easy to hold in your hand.  I\'d strongly recommend though getting a phone case because of all the plastic components  comprised in it.  (SEE PIC )  Most importantly,  and I can\'t stress this enough is that the Moto E meets ALL the band requirements for GSM and CDMA compatibility when choosing most phone carriers.  This  includes all the Major Carriers - EXCEPT IN RARE INSTANCES MAYBE VERIZON AND THE MVNO\'s LINKED TO THEM.  For instance, the Verizon website  by entering the IMEI/MEID # cites compatibility by saying "" it looks like your device the MOTO E Unlocked  XT2052-1 is compatible.""  However, it also states in smaller print ""some devices may not support all features and services.""  The Motorola corporate website confirms the Moto E (2020)  is compatibility using Verizon including their MVNO\'s.  My research has uncovered that the Moto E phone also does work with most low cost MVNO\'s  including many cheaper upstarts  out there like Red Pocket using only (GSM).  Many of you out there I see like Cricket Wireless through AT&T.  I put my IMEI # in with their checker tool and it came back with a Yes.  Unfortunately Cricket thinks this device is a GIN Lite phone.  Whatever that means?  The Motorola corporate website states US Cellular which uses  a CDMA network  won\'t work but yet the US Cellular compatibility tool asking only for my  IMEI # says YES.  A similar scenario applies to BOOST Mobile.  The Motorola site says NO but when I enter the requested IMEI # in the Boost checker tool it says YES.  I agree very confusing.  I did figure out that the  "" Pre Paid"" plans are the only ones that seem to be the most restrictive when using the Moto E unlocked. This  is likely the case for Boost which offers  many Pre paid plan services.  Such plans do differ from a ""Pay as you Go"" plan or an ""MVNO.""  They also seem to be the plans with no phone compatibility checker to confirm BYOP.  Most negative reviews you\'ll see here online center around services with these Prepaid plans.  Lastly, make sure that any phone service you\'re considering supports a Nano SIM card for your phone to operate.  Just know that If you\'re using an older cell phone with a Micro SIM card it will not fit.  However, this alone shouldn\'t be a problem.  Most carriers provide a free SIM card or a new one at a very nominal cost.  My phone didn\'t come with a SIM tool so I easily used a paper clip to open the SIM door on the phone to enter mine.  I know I threw a lot of information out there to digest in  only a single review.  However,  I believe knowledge is the key in selecting the right phone and carrier service.  I hate it when I make a wrong decision due to lack of information.  I encourage all Seniors out there to ditch your flip phones  and get yourself the Moto E (2020).  It\'s overall user friendly especially with Google Assistant.  It\'s 100 % compatible with MOST EVERY cell phone service carrier out there in the US.  Soooo.....  I guess if I go on any further I\'m  just beating a dead horse here... huh?  LOL  How can a Senior on a fixed budget go wrong with this purchase.  It\'s top rated by PC Magazine and Digital Trends.  Check out their great reviews online.  Heck, even a tightwad and proud of it, like consumer warrior Clark Howard loves Motorola phones.  What\'s that I hear ?  Yes of course, AARP members can also take this phone to Consumer Cellular with no problem.  That\'s about it friends.  I hope everyone enjoys their new phone.  No matter which one you choose to buy  :)', 'I am a mobile apps developer.  I purchased this phone with no intention whatsoever to use it as my daily phone, put to debug Android applications.  For that purpose, it works great.  But as I got used to the phone, I found myself liking it more and more, to the point where I ultimately removed my SIM card from my iPhone 7 (AT&T) and am now using the Moto G Fast as my primary device.Compared to my aging iPhone 7, the battery life is great.  I had almost forgotten that a smartphone could actually last the entire day without a recharge.  The screen is also phenomenal at the price point.  Granted, it does not get quite as bright as my iPhone 7 does (that phone actually hurts my eyes if I turn the brightness all the way up), but beyond that it\'s a great screen and the phone bezels basically do not exist.Performance is great.  I have noticed no slowdowns whatsoever, and I would rate it as being at least on-par with the iPhone 7.  Now, the iPhone 7 is an older phone so that might not be saying a lot, but to me that phone is snappy as well.  I am not doing any gaming or heavy tasks with these devices, so neither phone has slowdowns in my everyday usage.I said I do not do much phone gaming, but I did test it out on a couple of games.  I installed Minecraft, which runs great on the phone.  The only issue I had is that i find the larger screen size uncomfortable to hold while playing a game in landscape mode such as Minecraft.  Maybe uncomfortable is not the correct word, but there are instances where I have to let go of the phone with my right hand to tap on something towards the left side of the screen.  Maybe it\'s just the way I hold it though, again I am not really a gamer.  I also tested streaming my son\'s Xbox One to the phone using the Xbox app and a bluetooth controller, and it worked without issue.Camera quality is hit or miss, possibly the only major con of the phone.  If camera is your #1 concern then look elsewhere, of course if that is the case you probably are not shopping in this price range anyway.  In well-lit conditions, the camera quality is about on par with my iPhone 7.  In poor lighting though, pictures are not that great.  It can theoretically record 4k video, but I honestly did not think that the 4k videos looked any better than the 1080p videos, so I kept the setting on 1080p.Built in storage is a weak 32mb, but unlike many ""high end"" models out there, you can add a Micro SD card, making the low storage basically a non-issue.  I put in an old 64gb card I had lying around, and you can have the phone format your card to use it as additional internal storage.The phone charges via USB Type C, and charging seems fast enough, although I\'ve really only had to charge it a few times in the week and a half I\'ve had it, and I\'ve done at it night time so the charge time was largely unnoticed and irrelevant.  The phone also includes the illusive headphone jack, which is always welcome these days.There is almost no bloatware included with this device, just a couple of Motorola apps.  It is mostly stock Android with minor Motorola customizations.  I installed an AT&T SIM card and I am getting good reception and good data speeds.  WiFi connectivity is also good.  I have not tested out hotspot tethering yet.All in all, I am blown away by how much phone you can get now days at this price point.  I was planning on upgrading to an iPhone 12, but I think I am going to stick with this cheap Motorola for the time being.  For the price of a new iPhone, I could just get a brand new Motorola every single year for the next six years, at which point the iPhone would be long past due for a replacement anyway.  If you are looking for a good budget phone, or even just a good phone period, I would save your money and not hesitate to get this thing.  I don\'t see any reason whatsoever to shell out upwards to a thousand dollars (and even more now days) on a ""flagship"" phone, when a sub-200 phone works perfectly fine.', '**Update**: After ~8 months of use I am happy to report that it still runs fine.  In fact, I accidentally dropped it into my koi pond w/ no major aftermath issues.  Would still recommend this phone especially since the price has dropped even more.  The camera quality is still the only drawback really worth noting so if that is important to you, you may want to look elsewhere.It took me a long time to pull the trigger on this based upon how many bad review/problems were being reported even though the 2020 Motorola Edge checked a lot of boxes I was looking for: 5g, OLED, curved screen, zoom camera, wifi calling, stereo speakers.  However, I needed a 5G phone as my Sony Xperia 1 coverage was getting worse as T-Mobile kept installing 5G towers in my area.  Finally purchased one at ~40% off and so far it as not given me any issues after 2 months.  The production date of my phone was 10/21 so perhaps only the early makes had problems.At the reduced price, this was a very good deal.  Not quite a flagship device but definitely high-end mid-ranger with decent specs and performance.  The camera is so-so but the zoom & wide-angle need a lot of help.Pros:* Price – way over priced at the original $799 but the current discounts make it a great deal* Screen – my last several were QHD but this FHD+ does not seem bad or any worse.  Love the curved edges although that might not be for some as will affect how some things look.  I do not play games or watch anything fast moving like sports so I see no advantage to the 90hz screen (my first phone to have more than 60hz).* 3.5mm jack* Included case – always appreciate this being included so that you have immediate coverage while you shop for others.  It does block the charger some and you really have to press it in to work.* Battery Life – lasts all day with average use* 5G – Has a good 5G coverage with T-Mobile in my areaCons:* Updates – for their top tier phone, Motorola really should have given this 2 OS updates but it is stuck at Android 11.  Still gets security updates tho at a rate that appears to be every other month* Lack of cases – there are not a lot of cases available for this phone, especially if you are looking for one that does not cover the curved edges* No wireless chargingSo-So:* Cameras – the cameras are OK.  Turning on HDR and tapping to help focus takes better pictures.  The zoom camera is a definite disappointment as is the wide-angle.  Would have been nice if they had beauty mode on the back cameras and not just the front.* OS/Bloatware – The My US OS Skin is pretty much stock android and what few additions there are, are mostly useful and/or non-obtrusive.  There are some bloatware but all made by the manufacturer which I deem acceptable* Color – It is called Solar Black but it is really a dark iridescent blue.  When the light hits it in a certain way, there is rainbow across the back.* Water Repellent: This is good enough for my lifestyle but at this price range an IP68 rating would have been nice', ""I've been a Motorola fan for many years now. Their phones hold up well and have all the features I need."", ""Great looking phone. Bought two,one for myself one for wife......a few things to address .... First off I have not had any screen issues as reported by the neg reviews, screen is fantastic colors very vibrant and crisp. Screen is also very responsive to the touch.Other reviews stated that the phone doesn't support wifi calling, mine sure does and there is a icon to turn it on and off.Phone is very fast, indoors and outdoors and also supports 5g without any issues.Speakers on phone are very crisp/clear and will not get distorted even when turned up loud.Now here are the cons....Battery life is ok, could be better, I mean.... It will last you throughout the day, but I don't see how you would go two straight days without charger as advertised.Finger print reader is also ok.... Not great... It works some of the time, and you have to touch repeatedly to activate.Accessories.... Cases are very limited and cheaply built... But you need them in order to have some sort of protection.Also screen protector..... Hard to find for curved screen, you'll have to pay a few dollars more for one.Overall I really like the phone.... I don't see how you could go wrong buying."", 'I read all the negative reviews and I didn\'t really give them a second thought because every phone I looked at seemed to have its fare share of hecklers.  Let me tell you from the start, I\'m not paid for this.  I\'m just an average Joe that just upgraded from a Galaxy S7 that I bought when they came out so that is the context.The boxing was well done and I noticed quickly that the USB cable is different then the micros USB cables so be aware if this is a thing for you. I think it will probably help with the turbo charging but I\'m not sure.  With any luck these new cables will be less liable to become defective as quick as the other annoying micros USB cords do. When I plugged it in I was shocked to see the cool power level indicators flow up the edges.  It gave me that Techy Tingle (giggle).  I was excited to move forward.  I powered the device up and was blown away at the vivid colors of the screen and wow the edge of the display is so impressive.  The default back drop with the waves and sand moving.  Oh my.  I must move forward and see more.  I went through the wizard and did all the setup.  Pretty basic stuff and since I used Google Backup it was pretty straight forward.  A new feature on this phone that took some getting used to is the new method you use to go home, show previous apps, currently running apps, back, forward etc.  There is a a tutorial that walks you through it and I adapted pretty quickly to no longer having that button at the boom of my phone. Plus the screen real-estate is HUGE and ridiculously sharp.  The first App I fired up was my YouTube Music.  Everything restored perfectly and I was blown away at the sound quality of the speakers at the top and bottom of the phone.  It really takes this phone to an entirely new level.  Another thing I really appreciate is that this phone has a headphone jack.  I don\'t want to be tied to wireless earbuds because those tend to run out of juice but if your are a Bluetooth ear bud fan then you are still good to go.  If you run out of ear bud juice then switch over to wired just like that.  The next thing I started to play with is the camera.  WOW.  My S7 only had an 8MP camera.  This is 64MP if I recall.  Totally Insane.  There is also a ton of storage on this baby with 256 Gig of storage.  No more getting half way through that recital only to find you are out of space and your video or pictures are cut short.  This phone is roughly the same width as my S7 not including the extra edge roll effect which adds easily another 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch to the width.  The height is about another inch but when you add that the entire top to bottom is filled with screen you probably are easily at almost 2"" of extra top to bottom height.  I got the black model and it has some blue/purple reflection from the light.  It is so very stylish that I am going to have a tough time finding the right case because I want to show the elegance of this superb design.About the only Con I have right now is that my son wants to use this for his YouTube video recording and wants to borrow it for video games all the time.Some folks have talked about shaded areas or bubbles in their screen.  I didn\'t see any of this and I looked very close but I will keep my eye on it and I will use my warranty if needed but I\'m not worried.PS.  Don\'t forget to open the user manual box because the pin to open the top is in there.  This will allow you to add your sim card and memory chip when you get to your cellular carrier.Good Luck Friends.', '(Aug 14 update)Replacement received on four days ago. I\'ve been using the phone every day and it\'s working fine so far. I had a scare when I notice a portion of the screen ""bruised"" purple, but it was only the wallpaper. I\'m starting to use the features of the phone and like it more every day. My first impressions are all positive with a few hiccups here and there but nothing I can\'t live with. I have not returned the original device as I\'ve been waiting for the weekend. It\'s been powered off for days, so I turned it on two days ago. It was like it was brand new again and the screen issues were gone... all of them. However, within the hour, one by one, all previous screen issues came to say hello. Again, this is in the original faulty phone. The new phone is working fine so far. Wife\'s phone ""is still nice and cool."" Will do another update once I test the replacement phone over the weekend.(Aug 8, 2020 - Original post)TL:DR - Bought a phone for me and one for my wife. She loves hers and is working fine. Mine went from bad to worse to completely unusable by day 5. Pictures included here show the progression of the screen problems. I will update this review when I receive and use my replacement phone.-------Since I have not used my phone much and my wife is pretty much happy with hers because ""it looks cool and it works,"" I will focus my review on my experience so far. I have not been able to use the phone for too long due to terrible screen issues.,  so here is a day by day summary. Note that we only use the included plastic cover and no screen protector, so nothing has been used other than what came in the box.Day 1 - Phone looked awesome straight out of the box. Coming from the original Google Pixel (4 years old), this was quite an improvement. We used to have Motorola devices for the previous two before the Pixel. Setup of the device was a walk in the park, and all data was restored properly from the old phones. The default start-up screen and the default live wallpaper (waves) showed an amazing display! Both phones were able to send SMS messages, but would not receive them. Looks like it was a problem on Verizon\'s side and a quick chat with their support desk fixed the issue. Wife\'s phone had no issues after that. Mine had trouble updating Google Chrome (it would just not start it) and would not back up the phone even after several hours. I could not fix either issue on day 1.Day 2 - Not even 24 hours of usage, and the screen started to show a green tint under low light. This was obvious when compared to my wife\'s. After googling the issue, I found out that this was a common problem with the Edge+ and since they use the same screen hardware, well, same issue. It did not bug me too much though. The same day but later, I noticed a faint ""burned-in"" square at the bottom of the screen when any color other than white was on that area. I rebooted the phone and it was still visible during the start-up screen. After chatting with Lenovo support and posting in the forums, the square was suspected to be a detached fingerprint sensor since it appeared in the exact same spot where the fingerprint icon shows to unlock the phone. The suggestion was to request a replacement though Amazon since I had only had the phone for two days. By night, the ""green tinting"" of the screen was worse and some menus were very faint. I did a factory reset just to see what happened. Obviously, nothing was magically fixed, but I was now able to update Chrome and my device was backing up.Day 3 - Alas, I woke up and when I looked at my phone, I saw a small ""purple bruise"" on the left edge of the screen. I had never dropped the phone, so I wondered what that was. A Google search confirmed that this was another known issue with the Edge+ screen and now the Edge. Just my luck. Now I had a ""square"" and a ""bruise"" Interesting enough, the ""bruise"" was expanding through out the day. What was a small spot on the edge had now migrated to the main screen area.Day 4 - I woke up and looked at my phone. It all looked the same... square and bruise. As I used the phone, the ""bruise"" would expand and contract from time to time. As the day went by, the ""bruise"" ended up taking a third of the screen (left side). At one point, the ""bruise"" shrunk, and the screen started showing ""ghosting"" images (see picture). I needed to run errands, so I jumped into my car and fired up Google Maps. During my drive, the screen started to flash rapidly, so I turned the phone off. When I got to a store, I started up the phone, and now half of the screen was bright white. When I got home, I tried to use the phone, and the entire screen was now bright white and flashing and it didn\'t sense my touch. If I left the phone resting for a while, I was able to unlock it and use it for a minute, then the bright white screen and the flashing continued and I was unable to use the phone.That\'s where I am today. Wife is happy with her phone, so at least I have that going for me, but my personal experience has been completely frustrating. I\'ll see how things go once I receive the replacement next week... if I\'m lucky since it seems to be out of stock at the moment.', 'a stylish smartphone that comes packed with some great features. Here are some highlights:Design: The Moto Edge 2020 has a sleek, modern design with a 6.7-inch OLED display that curves around the edges of the phone. The back of the phone has a gradient finish that gives it a unique and eye-catching look.Performance: With a Snapdragon 765G chipset and 6GB of RAM, the Moto Edge 2020 delivers strong performance for most everyday tasks. It also comes with 5G connectivity, which is great for faster download speeds and lower latency.Camera: The Moto Edge 2020 has a triple-lens camera setup that includes a 64-megapixel main camera, a 16-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and an 8-megapixel telephoto lens.

It also supports fast-charging and can charge up to 50% in just 30 minutes.Software: The Moto Edge 2020 runs on Android 10 with the My UX software overlay. The software is clean, intuitive, and easy to use. It also comes with some useful features like Moto Display and Moto Actions.Overall, the Moto Edge 2020 is a great smartphone with a unique design, strong performance, and a great camera.

I am usually a  Galaxy Girl. Had three of the same class consecutively for some years. Then I got tired of the high pricetag.Enter Google Pixel 3.... I like it overall. It doesn\'t brush your hair or make you richer looking... but for significantly less than iPhone which charges an arm, a leg and your dogs teeth....I think it\'s an alright phone.I am young...early thirties with children. I am not a photographer but boy, does this phone have some nice shots. I walk around telling people I am a self-made photographer. Don\'t be fooled by the advertisements surrounding other megalodon-type mobiles. This phone has some of the best picture quality of any phone I\'ve had before.PHOTOS::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::If you are into having beautiful crisp and sharp images, this phone has the best quality and for me... beats the other two and any other phone I\'ve researched. I am a lunatic when it comes to researching...i.e. I use my Google pixel to split screens and look at multiple phones side by side and compare every little detail. LolI digress. Just an example to explain my theory better: we took a trip to Colorado, by far one of the most beautiful landscapes the eyes could see. I don\'t have the ability to go to Colorado every year and so I really wanted pictures that would capture that moment with my family.  At the time it was 2017 and I had a different random phone. Now that I look back at my thousands of photos in Google photos, I realize the quality was somewhat grainy and didn\'t capture the light the way I wanted it to.I am a lover of everything beautiful and nature. I love to capture the simple moments in life and the memorable ones with crisp, sharp and alluring photos and to relive those moments with nostalgia. This phone has hands down the best photo quality. I have researched it to be true (since a few months ago) and I can wholeheartedly say that the evidence speaks for itself. If you want to see every blade of grass, this phone will get you pretty close.I attached some pictures. I wrote Google/Samsung/iPhone on the pictures to show the difference in quality. The picture of my 🌹 rose from my rose bush has won alot of recognition from a gardening photography group. They couldn\'t believe it wasn\'t an expensive phone or DSLR camera.Now the bad.......I gave it four stars yes....it does have some issues but I can say with experience that it is due to my own errors.GAMING ABILITIES::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: I am an avid gamer. I play sometimes for hours on end, on this phone. In terms of ease of play, Google Pixel is easy to use, handling is fair and the brightness/ visuals are absolutely fine. Maybe not perfect but for the price it\'s pretty powerful. But if you\'re into gaming for eSports and making a living playing video games, maybe find a more gamer-friendly phone. You know, one that doesn\'t take fine pictures. ;)The bad issue with this phone which I knowingly blame on myself is that my screen has a somewhat faint shadow on the background that never goes away. I know from experience  that my last non-google phone  had it too. This is not due to the phone being bad quality but is just a natural cause of the phone keeping one screen on for a long time and in essence that image being burned into the screen. I am not aware of the term for this but hubby is a computer science/math background and explained this to me.In my case, I had left this notoriously large sized game running in the background a whole entire night. The image burned into the retina display and is forever a part of the phone.CAPABILITIES & MISCELLANEOUS:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::I will not go into detail about GB/ram, storage, battery, chargers, or anything else which can be easily compared online. If I did my review would be a novel. But overall, it is fairly decent in these other important departments. The battery is akin to my other phones I\'ve had. Pretty strong. The storage is true to size. The chargers I had no issue with but I have a horrible habit of using my phone while it\'s charging.Don\'t do this.There are some cool functions which other phones didn\'t have from my experience.This phone let\'s you choose and set times for the night light...which is a blue light filter. There is of course an option for a dark theme, an option to invert colors, to save your battery by shutting off other apps, there\'s a lot of ability to choose what you want to see or don\'t. You can of course split the screen which makes a world of difference when listening to music while texting or typing or reading an important article. Security works really well and is helpful to bundle with ease for Google play, Gmail, and other Google office apps. Just perfect.Mind you, there\'s a lot that other companies i.e., Samsung or iPhone or other competitors might be able to match or excel and some which they cannot. But the main reason this phone stands out is due to its affordability and the superior pictures, the no- nonsense ease of use, it\'s matching power to the more expensive phones. It is clutter free, allows you more control with your apps and interface.Overall, this phone has not let me down and if you are like me, and can do without the frilly  and minute yet unnecessary extras that come with the more popular phones, this phone will truly be a joy to use.The fact that this phone still runs and works with my notoriously bad behaviors should speak volumes. As well as the fact that my more careful significant other has his phone in pristine condition when he bought his months before mine.....this too should sway you into giving the more affordable phone a chance. And stop following crowds or false advertisement. Do your research before making a large purchase and remember most phones all do the same things. The small differences are about what you want to give and take for your own needs in a phone.The pictures I put are of landscapes and food and whatnot just to show you the difference in quality as well as similarities. In the end price becomes a factor. I tried to post all three popular phones in similar settings captured over the past 7 years to better show the differences.The photos with this phone are absolutely clearer and more defined. There\'s more options with focusing the pictures as well. Blurring the background...you can make that an automatic feature and much much more.I have had the phone almost two years now. Will buy another one of these when its\' time runs out. It\'s so not worth the extra money to buy more expensive phones especially when you prefer to have beautiful and crisp photos to remember your photos by and can do without the extra filler ""features"".Good luck in life whatever your choices!!!!', 'I was an early adopter of Google\'s phones when they came out with the Nexus line. Unfortunately, I never bought a Pixel because Google chose, at first, to compete with the expensive flagship phones that cost $800 or more being put out by Apple and Samsung every year. That has since changed, and I\'m a welcome convert back to the Google fold.My last phone was a Moto Z Play, which I purchased for $400 about three and a half years ago. I loved the battery life, but the bluetooth died almost entirely when the phone was two years old, and the camera was never great. By the time I had had it for three years, I couldn\'t run more than two or three apps without experiencing issues with crashing. Likewise, if I opened more than 50 or so tabs in the web browser, it would typically crash. It\'s a relief to no longer have those issues.COST: I purchased this phone when it was $320, so I already saved $80 over my last phone purchase. This phone does everything you need and looks sharp. It doesn\'t have 5G, but the amount of features you get for less than $400 more than justifies the price.CAMERA: Google has really outdone itself with the Pixel 3a\'s. The camera is fantastic; I no longer need to bring a dedicated digital camera when I\'m traveling or attending major celebrations like graduations that need a good camera. It\'s performance in low-light conditions is fantastic and really something to write home about. Sure, my  brother\'s iPhone 11 Pro has a better camera, but he paid over $1000 for it, so that\'s not a fair comparison. I\'d say that the Pixel 3A\'s camera and camera software is every bit as good as my wife\'s Galaxy 10, if not better.BATTERY LIFE: A full charge doesn\'t last the 2-3 days that my old Moto Z Play did, but the rapid charging feature makes it not matter as much. In my daily commute of 20-30 minutes to work, I can add about 30-40% to my battery, which means I never have to worry about my phone going dead, even if I forget to charge it at night. A full charge tends to last a little over a day with heavy use. For the record, nearly every day I browse the internet for hours, play Sudoku, listen to Spotify, and post and browse on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.HARDWARE: It\'s not a flagship phone, so it\'s not going to hold up to intensive use. That said, nothing I\'ve thrown at it so far as crashed it. Like I said, I\'m a heavy phone user. I don\'t have to close my apps before switching to another one like I did with my last phone to avoid crashes. I also have experienced hangs like I did with my last phone either. This really does everything you need it to do. I don\'t think that a normal to heavy phone user needs much more power than this unless they\'re gaming or photo editing on their phone or something. The bluetooth works a lot better than my old phones did. I have an aging 2013 Prius that does not like to play nice with bluetooth in a lot of my devices. I get in the car, and the phone automatically hooks to the bluetooth and brings up my last Spotify podcast without me fussing with it past the initial setup. I forgot how nice it was when things just worked, you know?LOOK & FEEL: I really like that it\'s lighter than my last phone even though the screen and the screen\'s resolution is much larger. It doesn\'t  have a trendy notch, but I don\'t really care. The fingerprint is located in a nice place in the back that feels very intuitive. There is a feature that lets you squeeze the phone to bring up Google Assistant that I could see some people enjoying, but I never use it because my hands are too small to put enough pressure on the phone to bring it up. Some people may dock a point or two for this, if it\'s important to you. I don\'t because I can just shout ""hey google"" at the phone to the same effect, and perhaps the feature works fine if you don\'t have tiny baby hands like me and buy a phone that\'s over 6 inches. The phone itself is mostly metal and glass and doesn\'t feel cheap. I don\'t think it looks like you spent less than $400 on it at all. Most importantly, it still has an aux port. Not all of us want the hassle of charging and keeping track of bluetooth earbuds that can cost more than your phone and don\'t sound any better than a $10 wired headset you can get at the pharmacy. The screen is absolutely huge and the resolution makes everything tiny. I don\'t have bad eyes and I\'m not an old maid, but I had to set the text size to ""large"" otherwise every website looks like those old Myspace profiles people made back in 2002 with size-6 font. It\'s very comfortable to read on; I don\'t feel like someone would need a dedicated tablet with a phone with a screen this big.SOFTWARE & OS/UI: If you\'re getting an Android OS, you\'ve probably fine with the OS. That said, Google\'s UI is so much better than everyone else\'s (I\'ve used UIs by Asus, Samsung, and Motorola in other phones). The home screen is easier to customize, the app launcher makes sense, and the app switcher is intuitive and quick. Since it\'s Google, you\'ll have the newest Android OS\'s at launch and support for longer than other manufacturers. That was one thing I missed dearly about my old Nexus, and I\'m glad Google is finally back in the sub-$500 market again so I can take advantage of it. I think my favorite feature about the UI is that I can turn on ""dark mode"" 24/7 so that I never have white bars or menus anywhere, just nice black ones. It\'s really saved my eyes. I also like that the volume and brightness on the phone has a very wide range of levels, much moreso than any other phone I\'ve had before, which always had ""silent,"" ""soft-ish"" and ""extremely loud"" with little in between. I can turn down the volume to almost-silent and the brightness to actually quite dark without installing third party apps. Also, there\'s no bloatware on the phone when you purchase it. That\'s really nice.All in all, it\'s a very solid phone and I\'m honestly thrilled with how nice the screen and camera is at this price-point. Everything else I\'ve looked at with comparable specs and features is at least $100 more. I\'ve been using mine for the past couple of weeks, and every day I like it more. Full five stars from me.', 'After several years of growing tired of my Samsung Galaxy work phones getting slower and more bloated with the Samsung UI, I was convinced by coworkers to go to a Pixel.  I got the Pixel 3 XL and instantly loved it.  Seconds, rather than minutes, to boot.  A fast UI experience.  Frequent and comprehensive OS updates that aren\'t lagging months behind the Android updates.  A fantastic camera.  What\'s not to love?Even though I refer to my Pixel 3 XL as my work phone, the truth is that I haven\'t had a personal phone in over a decade... who wants to carry two phones?  Then again, there is something to be said about having a healthy work/life balance.  With that in mind, I was curious when I heard about the 3a coming to the market... as much as I love the 3 XL, I can\'t say that I was super excited to spend $900 on a phone.  When the 3a XL dropped below $300 (after the deal that gave you a $100 GC), it seemed like a no brainer.As someone that has both a 3XL and a 3a XL, here\'s what I can tell you:SCREENUnlike the 3 XL, the 3a XL has no screen ""notch"".  Where there are some parts of the UI that take advantage of the notch, there are just as many applications that leave an annoying color (non-black) artifact in the notch area when watching landscape full-screen video - it\'s SUPER annoying.  The 3a XL\'s screen is slightly smaller than the 3 XL, and while it\'s also a little lower resolution, the density (as a result of the smaller diagonal measurement) doesn\'t drop that much.  In general usage I don\'t notice any difference.  The 3a\'s screen is OLED, but it appears to be a quality tier below the 3 XL\'s... you can see it if they are side-by-side, but you wouldn\'t notice it if you were going from memory.CAMERAPixel phones are renown for their camera performance.  While the raw specs tend to be behind other flagship phones\' optics and CCDs, the actual picture quality tends to be at or near the top of the heap.  The Pixel 3a XL is no different, as the rear camera is the same as the one on the 3 XL.  The front camera (which I really don\'t care as much about) goes with a single, rather than a dual, camera setup.  It\'s not the same as either front-facing camera on the Pixel 3 XL, but the software (which is largely responsible for the picture quality), is the same.  Both cameras appear to be excellent.FORM FACTORThe Pixel 3a XL is slightly larger than the Pixel 3 XL.  Some of it may be due to the notch-less screen causing the speaker and camera to be mounted above the screen.  Some may be due to the larger capacity battery.  Perhaps it\'s also influenced by the case material on the back being made of plastic, rather than glass.  Regardless, the phone is about 10% lighter, which is enough to be noticable.  An omission that I don\'t love is that the 3a XL does not support wireless chaging... it\'s not the end of the world, but it is missed.PERFORMANCEThe 3a XL does have a significantly slower CPU than the 3 XL.  The layout of both processors is to have 4 high speed cores, and 4 slower cores.  The general idea is that the system workloads can be managed by the OS\'es thread scheduler, and be placed on to the lowest power consuming core that is still adequate for the job.  Both phones are fine with multitasking.  I didn\'t actually notice any performance difference is the UI or in application speeds, but I also am not a mobile gamer... I would expect for the difference to be most obvious there (assuming there is one).  I was a little surprised when the 3 XL came out with 4GB of RAM (since I didn\'t know if that would be enough), but that worked out well.  The 3a XL has the same 4GB of RAM and therefore has similar performance.NOTABLE DIFFERENCES NOT ALEADY MENTIONEDOddly, the Pixel 3a XL has a headphone jack.  That\'s noteworthy because the 3 XL does NOT have a headphone jack.  I know there are some ""purists"" that are anti-bluetooth, but I\'d say that a phone is not an audiophile platform anyway.  Even if you have awesome $1500 headphones, I can still tell you that the DAC in your sub-170 gram phone is junk (comparatively).  One of the really nice features of the Pixel 3 XL is that it\'s waterproof... the 3a XL is not.  It\'s not a dealbreaker for me, but I can see where this would affect some peoples\' choices.In conclusion, I thought the deal I got on Amazon when I bought my 3a XL was so good that I bought the phone without even knowing if I\'d get a service plan for it.  Now that the 3a XL is at its ""normal"" price I still think it\'s an incredible deal, and I really question anyone who would buy a different phone at this device\'s price point.  Highly Recommended.', 'My digital life is in the Apple ecosystem, but as a web developer, I need an Android phone for testing purposes. I wanted to go with a Google Pixel phone because I prefer a ""clean"" Android experience without extra clutter other phone manufacturers are compelled to add.This phone is a few years old now and as of this writing only supports up to last year\'s version of Android, but again, as a web developer, I need to be able to test the average user\'s real experience, and unless a user is always updating to the newest phones, they\'re going to be stuck on a year-or-two-old version of Android anyway.Even though my interest in this phone was purely utilitarian, I actually do like it as a device. It\'s super-slim, has a pretty decent camera, and the fingerprint recognition on the back works great. I\'m not likely to give up my iPhone, but if I had to switch to Android today, I think I\'d be happy using this phone for quite a while. And the price can\'t be beat!', ""I switched from Samsung Galaxy to the Google Pixel because I wanted a better camera, and I definitely got better quality photos though it seems I don't have as many options for editing the photos on the Pixel, like adding stickers, etc. Reading the reviews, the notch was a big deal to some people but I don't notice it at all. I found it awkward to take screenshots - how do you hold the power and volume buttons at the same time when they're on the same side of the phone? On the Samsung they were on opposite sides so much easier. I accidentally discovered that I can just swipe up and get a screenshot button to press. I didn't find that tip in any of the help sites. Adding the emoji icon to the phone keyboard shortcuts was something else I figured out by accident. You'd think it would be there already. I like the call screening feature! It's easy and works great. I find the battery doesn't last as long as I would like, but I guess that's to be expected from a new Pixel 3 XL that I bought more than three years after it was released in 2018. It does charge very fast and it was super easy to transfer apps from my Samsung using the cord that came in the box. I thought the larger size might be a problem being a petite person, but it fits my hand just fine. For using basic apps and taking photos and videos, I would recommend buying this phone. It was 1/5 of the original price so definitely worth it."", ""February 6th 2023 - 12:30amAfter some careful research, I decided to purchase a Google Pixel 3a [with 64GB Memory Cell Phone (Unlocked) - Clearly White] to install the Ubuntu Touch OS on it, so once the UT people get VoLTE (Voice Over LTE or 4G) figured out, I'll have a phone that is completely free of Apple or Google data hoarding.Short Story:Got UT on the phone, but it was a huge pain in the ass to do, and I'm waiting for that VoLTE upgrade. Minus one star for the inconveniences.Long Story:The Pixel 3a is a sweet little phone. Can't upgrade the storage but it has an audio and USB-C ports. The worst part of the phone is that it's married to Google. Hmf. Plus, even though my new 3a came directly from Google, it came installed with Android 10 and the OEM Unlock option greyed out. UGH! This meant before I flash Ubuntu Touch on my phone, I'd have to unlock the OEM unlock and downgrade to Android 9... Google really doesn't want you playing with YOUR electronics...It took a long weekend and a lot of failures, but I finally got Ubuntu Touch on my 3a (no paying a third party to do it either). It's a nice little clutter-free OS, and while most big 3rd party apps are unavailable -- you can download YouTube and Gmail apps if you want; I'm going to try out ProtonMail --the included apps and the ones from the OpenStore give you basic functionality. While I haven't tested a sim or phone service yet (expecting a needed OS update to get VoLTE up an running to work in the US), WiFi works great on the phone and you can manually set up a VPN if you need it.Although the UBPorts website the phone os working 100%, there's that VoLTE issue and my fingerprint reader isn't working, also I had to download the uTorch app to get the phone's flash to work as a flashlight. Still... the ability to have a small private Linux-but-Google-free computer (yes, allegedly you can bluetooth/dock a keyboard and monitor) that can (hopefully) make phone calls is a pretty amazing feat in 2023.I'll update this review when I decide to try my T-Mobile sim on the phone, if only to transfer my contacts.UPDATE Feb 6th, 2023 1:25am:Good news! I switched my T-Mobile sim to my 3a and was able to make phone calls! I had to jump through a hoop or two to move my phone contacts, but they're usable now too. Successfully called a closed pizza place (got voice mail) and called my insurance company (voice mail again). The fingerprint reader seemed to activate and worked after I swapped my sim into the 3a (??). All I need is a new sim from one of the pay-as-you-go companies and I have a more-private phone -- won't call it a burner; I don't think they really exist anymore, but this phone now upsets the data hoarders so I'm happy. :P"", 'I bought this Pixel and it was sent like new & GOOD battery life Thank You! IThis phone is good in the hand and I have now ordered a case also after my experiments below.I am paranoid on Privacy since I watched so many of those you tube videos about privacy. I both this phone for testing other operating systems that is secure and private.I have tested different operating Systems on this. Grapheneos, CalyxOS and Finally UBUNTU TOUCH. This was due to privacy concerns on Google Android loaded operating systems on Normal Smart Phones. All these work fine, but Grapheneos is very bare and it security limits its use, because you cannot really load standard Google apps without breaching is security features. CalyxOS comes with a App Store loaded and google Spoofed services and this is more useful but not as secure. Unfortunately both Grapheneos, CalyxOS and LineageOS are just De-googled Android and I found that my Cellular Service Provider can still install their SIMKIT software and force Zero Level or Flash SMS messages at will on your screen. Very Annoying! So UBUNTU TOUCH(LINUX) is also bear with few aps , but SIMS cannot load software on it. WAYDROID is loaded with a LineageOS version in a Contained environment and allows Android apps to work , but is Experimental and stops also this phone does not have the processing power to run both operating system with its RAM. (4gb- Qualcomm SDM670 Snapdragon 670 )I am still very happy to have a fully functional phone with UBUNTU TOUCH, Fully working browser and I imported +3000 Contacts from 2 google account Contacts export format: vCard format. There is also a map app. The mail app for this might not be secure due to privileges granted on the full operating system , so I am not using it. You never have to sign in to a google account to use aps , but you can use the Free UBUNTU TOUCH app for G-Mail to ready and write E-Mail(Gmail). I would say it is more secure than any other smartphone on the planet, but limited in some function. Another good thing I found is I can select 2g only, 3 g only or 4g Auto network select. Because My area has bad reception and I just need to make calls I use it on 2g with full signal and good calls.(All the phones I tested Iphone X and LG V60 only allows 5G or 4G auto select and even if you select a 2 g tower manually it goes back to 4 G in 3 seconds. On 2g my phone only looses 4% battery in 8 hours overnight! (And this is a second hand phone)For now I will keep my Iphone X for Banking and Mail and use the Pixel with UBUNTU, its fun!!My next venture might be VOLLA PHONE 22 with Volla OS or UBUNTU & Waydroid for more speed.', 'ps m llego ayer y me llegó como si fuera nuevo por 1700 pesos ajjsjas lo recomiendo ampliamente si quieren algo q no cueste arriba d 2000 pesos', 'Let me start off my review by putting it in proper context.  I use the phone to make calls/texts, take family pictures, browse the internet, use about ten apps regularly, and of course write Amazon reviews.  I’m not too interested in fancy features and I prefer function and value over having the latest and greatest, which is why I waited over a year to purchase this phone after it was released.I purchased this phone after extensive research, mostly based on favorable reviews and the price.  I am well aware there is a reason this phone is less expensive than the Google Pixel 3 or Pixel 4.  I also didn’t want to finance another $800 phone from Verizon so I wanted an unlocked phone that I could purchase and connect to their network.  Verizon was pushing the Google Pixel 4 and other expensive phones and didn’t even offer the 3a models.  The price is right on Amazon for this phone at $378, which would break down to $15.75 per month if it was under one of those Verizon financing plans for 24 months.  Most of their phones are going for $30-$45 per month to finance so this is a bargain.The Good:  Besides winning on price, this phone was a breeze to set up.  The SIM card easily inserted into the phone and it quickly connected to the Verizon network without issue.  The set up instructions were easy to follow to get the phone up and running quickly.  The Pixel 3a also transferred all data, apps, and pictures from my old Galaxy S7.  It used a USB cable to connect and download everything.  Even texts, voicemails, and everything else transferred over so I never felt lost.  Google Chrome and Gmail are my primary browser and email so browsing history and saved passwords also transferred over.Once connected this phone operates smoothly and it is easy to navigate.  The camera is outstanding and surpasses my iPhone 7 Plus, except for the fact it doesn’t offer the panoramic photo option which I’ve come to appreciate on the iPhones.  Another bonus with this phone is the battery life which ranks high on my list of important features.  This battery lasts all day long even with regular use, which is something I wasn’t used to on the Samsung Galaxy or iPhone even when they were new phones.  It also charges very quickly with the provided charger and I estimate a full charge took less than 90 minutes.The Bad:  The bad really isn’t all that bad when taken in proper context.  There is a reason this phone is half the price of other models since it’s missing some luxury features.  Apparently this phone isn’t waterproof, which comes as a surprise to me since I’ve never known any phone to be waterproof and am always careful with my phones around water.  Wireless charging capability is also missing from this phone so you may miss that feature if wireless charging is your thing.The most impactful thing that I experienced was this Pixel takes a different charger cable than I was accustomed to.  We have a ton of micro USB cables in the house for older Android and Kindle devices, along with Apple charging cables.  This phone takes a USB-C cable.  It comes with a charger and battery life is excellent so this isn’t a huge issue either.Summary:  This is an outstanding phone and should work well for the vast majority of users.  It operates and looks far more expensive than it really is, making me realize how much the phone companies are ripping us off selling overpriced phones.  It wins in value, setup, camera, operating speed and battery life.  Minor points are lost for missing some of the fancier features like wireless charging and being a different charging cable than most people already have, but those don’t weigh heavily on my opinion of this Google Pixel 3a so I am giving this a strong four stars.']"

Frechheit.-- Kein 3,5 Klinke Anschluss wie beim F5 ohne Pro- Nur USB-C- Akku nur 10 Stunden trotz 5160 mAh- Wasserschutz nur IP53--- Kein SD Karten Slot!-- Makro Objektiv nur 2 MPWer eine ""lange Geschichte"" lesen möchte:Ich habe das Poco Smartphone in der Version F5 Pro, 12GB + 512 GB, gekauft.Ich vergleiche es mit meinem bisherigen Phone, einem Huawei P30 Pro 8GB + 128 GB von 2019, mit Android 10.Das Poco kommt mit Android 13 und MIUI 14, genauer 14.0.4.0, und bietet direkt ein Update auf 14.0.5.0 an, das Android bleibt aber 13. Die Version 14.0.5.0 ist 437 MB groß und aktualisiert den Sicherheitspatch auf Juli 2023, 2023-07-01.Also ich bin von mehreren Dingen enttäuscht aber gebe trotzdem 5 Sterne weil das Poco eigentlich nichts dafür kann, es sind mehr grundsätzliche Dinge und auch Android-Probleme.Zunächst, im ""Alltagsbetrieb"" ist keine deutliche Verbesserung zum P30 Pro zu spüren, nur eine leichte, das liegt aber am P30 Pro welches mit seiner Kirin 980 CPU und 8 GB RAM bereits für sehr flüssige und geschmeidige Verhältnisse beim Navigieren und Scrollen sorgt, das ist nunmal nicht mehr zu toppen.Selbst im Gaming Bereich spüre ich keinen großen Unterschied (Genshin Impact, GI), nur ein wenig.Obwohl das P30 Pro im Antutu Benchmark nur 585k Punkte erreicht und das F5 Pro 1,1 Mio. ... Das ist das Doppelte, wirkt sich aber in der Praxis nur wenig aus.... Erstaunlich.Es scheint dass das P30 Pro mit 8GB und einer CPU die ca. der Snapdragon 860 entspricht, ausreichend kräftig ist für Android 10 und aktuelle Spiele, mehr braucht man derzeit nicht.Allerdings sind die 128 GB ROM vom P30 eng geworden, ich habe schon 102 GB verbraucht, da tun die 512 GB des F5 natürlich gut. Das ist eine deutliche Verbesserung. (Netto sind es 496 GB).Allerdings kann man den ROM Speicher des F5 Pro nicht erweitern, kein Slot für Speicherkarte oder SD Karte, nur Dual-SIM, vorhanden.Auf meinem P30 Pro habe ich eine teure NM Card 128GB installiert, dafür musste ich meine zweite SIM Card rausschmeißen die ich doch selten benutzte.Meine Rezension richtet sich an User, die ein Phone in der Größenordnung Snapdragon 785-845 von 2019 bis 2021 besitzen, und überlegen, auf ein Poco mit 8+ Gen 1 CPU upzugraden.Mein Fazit: von der CPU her lohnt es sich noch nicht. Die 12 GB RAM bringen auch keine spürbare Verbesserung.Aber die 256 oder 512 GB ROM wären vielleicht ein Argument. ROM kann man nie genug haben.Wer schwächere CPUs als 785 besitzt, für den lohnt sich der Umstieg auf jeden Fall.Weitere Eindrücke:Das Poco F5 Pro ist größer und dicker (klobiger) als das Huawei P30 Pro. Nicht gut für zarte Damentaschen.Das P30 Pro ist schwer zu toppen, das gelingt dem F5 Pro nicht so ganz.Das Display des F5 Pro ist subjektiv trotz AMOLED und 120 Hz nicht spürbar schärfer oder besser als das vom P30 Pro, wohl aber deutlich heller, was outdoor ein Vorteil ist.Das Poco ist groß und klobig. Für zarte Frauenhände ist das nicht ideal, glaube ich.Fazit,Das Poco F5 Pro ist ein hervorragendes Smartphone das seinen Preis wert ist, aber Phones der Oberklasse von 2020 oder 2021 in der Alltagspraxis noch nicht übertrumpfen kann.Das Poco hat aber 5G, wer darauf Wert legt sollte es kaufen.Die Kamera des Poco ist gut, hat aber kein optisches Teleobjektiv 5x wie das P30 Pro. Das tut mir nicht weh da ich das Teleobjektiv selten benutzt habe. Bilder im Schatten sind unterbelichtet.Das Poco ist gut und wertig verarbeitet, ein Schmuckstück, genauso wie das P30.Der Akku hält nicht länger als beim P30 Pro trotz 5160 mAh Kapazität (P30:  4200 mAh). Die CPU verbraucht wohl viel Strom.Der Akku hält bei mir nur 9 Stunden SOT. Beziehungsweise nur 6 Stunden SOT da ich immer von 20 auf 80 % nur lade, um den Akku zu schonen.SOT = Screen On Time.Trotzdem ist das Poco insgesamt ein faszinierendes Smartphone, andere Phones auch teurere, sind nicht besser.Alle haben Nachteile.Von mir 5 Sterne. Kaufen.Wer Spaß an Technik und Spezifikationen hat, CPU, RAM, ROM, 4nm, 8K Video,  AMOLED, Wireless Charging, etc. , sollte es kaufen.Aber keine Wunder erwarten.Ein preiswertes Phone für den halben Preis tut es eigentlich auch.Ich vermisse mehrere altgewohnte Funktionen in der Bedienung, aber dafür kann das Poco nichts, es sind eher Android-Probleme. Es hat mehrere Verschlimmbesserungen seit Android 10 gegeben, und Funktionen sind abgeschafft worden. Schlimm sowas.Always something.Fazit: Schönes Smartphone. Kann ich empfehlen. Ich würde es wieder kaufen.', 'Oneplus7(2019/5発売)のBluetoothとバッテリーがダメになったので、こちらを購入。使い始めて１週間ほどですが、かなり満足です。スペックは大いに満足。ディスプレイのなめら無さもさることながら、全体的にかくつくような動作もなし。ディスプレイはなめらかで操作しやすい。サイズが分厚いのが少々難点（ランニングポーチの買い替えが必要）ぐらいでしょうか。全体的い良い買い物でした。', 'Ótimo aparelho, rápido, ágil, mta memória.

This time I chose this rugged smart phone based on a lot of research. Although I had learned a lot of relevant information in advance, I was still shocked when I got this phone.  First of all, it comes with a fully enclosed protective case, which has excellent anti-drop, waterproof and dustproof functions.  It has tough lines, full metallic texture, and a sci-fi feel.  It is equipped with an 8 core processor, plus 16GB RAM + 256GB ROM, which is enough to meet my daily use needs.  I’m sure you’ve never seen a 1,200-lumen camping light on other mobile phones, and a 10,000 mAh large-capacity battery, which makes it a portable power bank.  Although it looks rough, the 2408x1080 resolution still gives you clear vedio quality and rich colors.  Even in the wild, you can still enjoy a perfect visual experience.  The most exciting part is that in addition to the regular 48MP rear camera and 16MP front-facing selfie camera, it is also equipped with a 20MP night vision camera and two infrared lights, which can take clear photos in dark environments at night.  It's incredible that it did.  I am ecstatic about such a smartphone that looks very sci-fi and has a variety of special and practical functions.  I have been using it for a month and it performs well. I am very satisfied and would recommend it."", ""Why on earth this doesn't work with Verizon, straight talk or TMobile metro by t mobile has me irritated and out of 80 bucks just trying. Each time it said it was compatible then when activating it was incompatible. Can't return cards so I'm returning the phone and buying one from a company with a brain that can make them usable for major carriers. Huge disappointment phones a 1 lb paperweight."", ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0I was in need of a cellphone and I found this and, I'm so amazed with this rugged smartphone, the quality is just wow, never expected something like this.First of all is well done, thick and sturdy, sure is heavy duty phone and it's durable.It was easy to set up, you just need to follow the instructions in the phone and you are all set up and ready to use.Great for using in the job, for camping or outdoors activities since it has a very very bright lamp and the phone is so sturdy in case you drop it, also the phone is waterproof.Other amazing thing are the photos, this is very important to me since I love taking photos and videos and te picture quality is very good, the photos are really pretty.The phone has 256GB of memorie another awesome thing, I can store many things with this capacity, and you can also put an external SD card in case you need more memorie.Battery life is way beyond my expectations, it last a very long time once I fully charge it.Very happy with my finding and with this purchase, the phone is so cool and good quality for a very affordable price, I didn't had to break my bank with the ridiculous prices phones are right now, I totally recommend this phone!"", ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0* This Rugged Smartphone has everything you can wish for in a smartphone.

I was very pleased to find this one which I find comparable to a namebrand phone and even better and someways at a fraction of the cost. This smart phone has a lot of memory up to 256 GB of ROM and 16 GB of RAM. I like that you can also expand it up to 1 TB if you use a TF card.This is a really rugged phone. It actually feels like it has a case on it already because it is very thick and it is IP 68 waterproof as well. It also has a dust proof and drop proof resistance to it to you. This has a 10,000 MAH battery so I can get up to  16 hours of constant use before it needs to be recharged. It even has a cool built-in camping light in the back with different functions like SOS and adjustable brightness. This phone comes with some built in apps and it’s very easy to navigate. I like how user-friendly it is as well, and once I hooked up my information in the play store, I can download anything I wanted.

It has a fast processor and ample ram as well, along with plenty of internal storage and the ability to add memory cards for removable onboard storage.The camera takes great photos and videos, and has most of the features the iPhone has, along with a few extra. You even have onboard AI for photo processing features as well.The gesture control option will make it easy for iPhone users to switch to this phone by making the user interface the same movements to get the same results.The wifi works great, and the antenna is powerful. I can pick up more hotspots and connect to access points that are further away with this phone than I can with my iPhone XS Max!The only downside to this phone is that it is a BRICK 🧱! It is VERY heavy, and somewhat bulky too. Carrying it around on your person would be a chore. But, using it in a car 🚙, at home, or the office, or putting it in a bag would be doable. But if you need a rugged phone 📱, with extended battery 🔋 capacity, a large screen, and all the latest features, then this phone is a good choice. I think for people doing work- scientific, construction, field work, commerce, this phone would be a good option.Bottom line- great phone with great screen, great camera, sensitive reception, lots of expandable storage, tons of battery 🔋 capacity, fast processor, and nice UI- but it is VERY heavy, and bulky in size. Only you can decide if this will meet your needs and requirements.I hope this helps.

This BV9200 is more premium than the one other rugged phone which I have used before, it has an ok enough chipset- Mediatek Helio G96 (2x A76 cores + 6x A55 efficiency cores) paired with 8GB of LPDDR4x RAM. You get a nice 256GB of storage, as well as Micro SD card slot (something that is becoming more and more rare as time passes). The display is 120Hz, which makes a real difference in how smooth and fluid of an experience it is to use this phone. They market it as ""2.4k"" but this is incorrect, it is just full HD+. You are supposed to use the smaller of the two dimensions (so it would be 1080p or 1k) when you The speakers are surprisingly not bad, either. They have Harmen Kardon branding, and sound much better than the average lower-midrange Android phone.The phone supports Power Delivery Fast charging at 66 watts, this is great to see because many Android phones by these chineses OEMs have USB C but only support 2 amp/10-12 charging and don\'t even properly support USB C Power Delivery protocol. It also supports faster, 30 watt wireless charging. Although, I couldn\'t test this because it doesn\'t include a faster wireless charging pad in the box. All of the ones I have at home can only charge at 15 watts.The Camera, what I can say? The sensor is decent enough- Samsung ISOCELL JN1 (50MP), but the image processing (which is usually proprietary, although does leverage the phone\'s ISP on the SOC) is just not up to snuff with the likes of a flagship device. This phone is using ArcSoft image processing, which is cool to see because there is usually just a lack of image processing on this type of Android device, it does seem to help image quality somewhat, although it still could be better. It\'s certainly serviceable but don\'t expect anything close to top-tier photos from this phone.Be aware that this phone is limited to Widevine Level 3, so you won\'t be able to watch full resolution videos from apps like Netflix and others that require Level 1 encryption. This is a huge problem with budget/lower-midrange Android devices using non-flagship chipsets. I think 480p-540p is the highest quality you can get from Widevine Level 3.Now, let\'s talk about build-quality. This device is very, very durable. It will be much more resilient from dust, water, and impact from drops. This is the biggest thing that differentiates it from the average smartphone, you really don\'t need a case because it basically has one built-into the phone. You really should only get this product if you need the durability, otherwise there are probably better options for the same price. My review is from the premise that someone needs this protection and is buying this device for that reason.Pros+Built like a TankMediatek Helio G96 - respectable performance, decidedly midrange though8GB of RAM + 256GB of StorageMicro SD Card slot for expansion66 Watt wired fast charging + 30 Watt wirelessTÜV Rheinland Low Bluelight certified 1080x2400 IPS 120Hz screen (6.6 inches in size)Cons-Widevine Level 3 only (This means that certain streaming apps, most in fact, won\'t allow you to watch videos in 1080p or 720p, you will be limited to standard definition)Software support (security patches and Android updates) is questionable like many other non-premium Android devices, is already 1 year behind compared to the latest version of AndroidCamera quality is not very good, quite far behind flagship phones']"

Entrei em contato com o vendedor VÁRIAS VEZES, e ele finalmente me respondeu dizendo que ""os correios não identificaram meu produto, mas ele faria uma nova postagem por Sedex"", nunca havia acontecido algo do tipo comigo.

Conferi todos os números de Imei que nele continham (do adesivo traseiro, da caixa e principalmente do próprio smartphone) e todos eles bateram com o site da Xiaomi de autenticidade, ou seja, o meu aparelho é original.

Não me arrependo em nada de ter comprado ele. Eu usei o celular por quase um mês pra vim poder avaliar sobre ele, então vamos lá: a câmera do celular é incrível, tirei essas duas fotos pela câmera traseira e a qualidade (como podem ver) é absurda. A frontal é muita boa também, uma das melhores que já pude experimentar, porém não supera a câmera traseira. Sobre o armazenamento: nada a reclamar, nunca tive tanto armazenamento de sobra kkkkk tanto pra armazenar foto, vídeo, documentos, etc. Pra quem gosta muito de jogar no celular, esse celular é pra você, eu jogo bastante no celular e não trava, não da delay, a resolução é absurda também, tanto em gráfico, quanto em qualidade! Sobre o som: tem duas saídas, em cima do celular (perto de onde se conecta fone de ouvido) e embaixo (perto de onde carrega), então a forma de escutar uma música, ou ver um filme, ou até mesmo pra jogar é muito diferente, a experiência é outra! Sobre o sistema do celular: pra quem já usou xaiomi, é a mesma coisa, não muda muito, não! Mas mesmo assim é uma experiência diferente; Gostei bastante, tanto em sistema de segurança, quanto sobre a velocidade dos aplicativos, de internet, de conexão, tudo mesmo. Pra usar no dia-a-dia também é muito bom, não usei o celular no modo desempenho (ainda), mas mesmo assim tudo sobre o celular é seguro. Você pode colocar senha até pra bloquear aplicativos, sem precisar baixar um aplicativo que faça isso, porque o próprio sistema te fornece essas funções! Tem muitas coisinhas que eu fui descobrindo com o tempo, fuxicando aqui e alí kkkkk, mas o que eu tenho a dizer em geral do celular é que ele ganha (?) de um iPhone, digo isso porque vi várias pessoas comparando tanto a câmera, quanto armazenamento e por aí vai. Eu gostei demais desse celular e não me arrependo de ter comprado ele, então podem comprar com confiança! Vocês não vão se arrepender!', 'Olha, é um celular excelente, mas preciso ser sincero em um ponto que realmente deixou a desejar.É um celular muito lindo, e leve de segurar.Sua tela é incrível ainda mais por ter Dolby vision e suporte ao HDR10, assistir séries nesse celular é realmente incrível!!!Achei ele muitoooo rápido, sai de um Redmi note 10S que também já oferecia um bom desempenho, mas esse aqui é realmente muito bom!O áudio dele é muito altooooo e o som é muito nítido.Bateria dele é ok, nada muito extraordinário, duro o dia todo, porém, desativei o 120 hz e deu uma melhorada significativa.Carregamento ainda não testei, mas por ser 67W tem um ótimo desempenho na hora de recarregar.Câmeras é o que deixou a desejar e muito, achei que por ser um celular tão caro ele viria com excelentes câmeras, mas não foi isso que aconteceu, eu instalei a gcam pra tentar melhorar, instalei diversos xmls mas ainda assim não tem uma qualidade esperada na faixa de preço que ele está. Meu Redmi note 10s que é linha intermediária básica faz fotos beeem mais nítidas que esse aqui. Deixei algumas fotos com a gcam, em ambientes bem iluminados as fotos saem boas, dentro do esperado já que está em boa iluminação. A questão dessa câmera é que parece que ela tem um ruído que a torna horrível (Mesmo com gcam) quando vc da Zoom nas fotos e compara com aparelhos mais baratos você vê a diferença de qualidade de imagem.Pra finalizar, eu compraria ele novamente mesmo que não tenha estregado muito em câmeras (Que era meu foco) ele deixa a desejar nesse ponto mas compensa em outros como bateria, desempenho, som estéreo, tela e etc.', 'O telefone é maravilhoso, rápido; dá pra usar dois chips; a tela é excelente, com cores bem vivas e a bateria dura o dia todo. Eu uso bastante, baixo muito material para escola, faço chamada online, preencho diário online, ou seja, uso bastante a internet e, ainda assim, ao final do dia fico com 30% mais ou menos!  As fotos ficam excelentes e vídeos também, de alta qualidade! Bluetooth, transmissão e gravador de tela são bem rápidos e fáceis de conectar! O som é muito bom também. O carregamento da batera é bem rápido. O aparelho é lindo e muito leve. Comprei o azul, cor maravilhosa! Por enquanto estou amando!', 'Produto chegou dentro do prazo estipulado e com tudo ok, neste ponto está de parabéns o vendedor, já em relação ao aparelho me decidi com base nas avaliações de outros e acredito que em muitas delas faltou sinceridade. (as primeiras impressões e em menos de uma semana)é bom em vários aspectos mas falha miseravelmente em outros, ex: bateria não dura mais que 8h, razoável sim, mas não pra um aparelho que custa 2k, e a impressão é sempre a de que vai derreter tudo de tanto que esquenta\U0001fae0 carregando ou em uso continuo, e a câmera apesar de razoável, não corresponde aos 108 pixel anunciado no aparelho, nesse ponto creio que a marca faltou com a vdd. (No geral é razoável, mas tenho minhas dúvidas se o aparelho vai durar o suficiente para valer a 🪶)', 'Produto de excelentíssima qualidade, a Xiaomi como sempre caprichando em sua linha Poco, eu vim de um Poco X3 Pro que é sensacional e agora no Poco X5 Pro não tenho o que reclamar. Equipamento super completo, entrega realmente o que promete, processador super rápido, câmeras não deixam a desejar e se usar o Gcam nele fica melhor ainda, a bateria como sempre durando o dia inteiro, mesmo eu assistindo vídeo boa parte do dia no trabalho, mas ainda chego em casa com 35% de bateria, de uso moderado vai 1 dia e meio tranquilamente. Aparelho super fino e leve, mesmo sendo fabricado em plástico mas  entrega muita qualidade em sua construção comprei o azul que é uma cor linda, tela não tenho o que questionar, a tela Amoled é absurda de top, os 900 nits entregam exatamente uma visibilidade incrível, mesmo estando diretamente no sol da pra enxergar a tela sem ter dificuldade nenhuma. O aparelho é realmente o que dizem, com certeza um dos melhores, se não o melhor intermediário do mercado hoje em sua faixa de preço.', 'Tive iPhone desde 2013. Uma única vez que tentei migrar para Android eu me arrependi amargamente.Esse celular é incrível. Não deixa nada a desejar. Atualmente é o melhor custo e benefício dos intermediários.O meu celular é versão global, possui NFC. E o carregador é modelo padrão Brasil.Meu pedido atrasou. Mas a culpa foi dos correios e não do vendedor. Pois comprei em um dia e no outro o vendedor já despachou.Quem estiver em dúvida, podem comprar. Eu estou me adaptando após mais de 10 anos de IOS. Mas a cada dia que passa tem me encantado mais esse aparelho.Podem comprar, não vão se arrepender.', 'Gostei muito do produto, fiquei um pouco decepcionada apenas com a câmera fotográfica, antes tinha um Zenfone 5 e as fotos eram sem comentários, com a falta de um manual que possibilite tirar o máximo proveito das funcionalidades do produto, falta de suporte técnico, mesmo em outro idioma e a questão do som, o microfone muitas vezes não captura a nossa voz com nitidez.', 'Até o momento aparelho excelente, câmera fenomenal, custo benefício muito bom, única diferença que percebi entre outros aparelhos que já tive, é somente o sistema operacional. Porém nada de sete cabeças, conforme for mexendo tem uma ótima adaptação.Bateria boa, porém pelos comentários, achava que teria uma durabilidade maior (pelo menos dois dias usando direto).Como eu faço uso o dia todo tem um bom desempenho, recarrego 1x ao dia, e a carga completa super rápido.', 'O celular e muito bom em quentão de tudo que vc for fazer ele faz muito bem , não testei muito a câmera dele mais vi alguns vídeos que testam e parece bem boa , mais a única coisa que não curti muito foi a bateria , longe de ser ruim mais eu esperava mais .', 'A casi un mes de que recibí el producto, no he tenido ningún problema al usarlo.Soy reportero para un periódico en mi ciudad, el celular lo he usado para tomar videos (1080p 60fps / 4k 30 fps) y tomar diferentes tipos de fotografías, especialmente con el modo 108megapíxeles (sí, deben activar los 108MP en el apartado de ""Más"" en los modos de fotografía) y hasta el momento no he notado cortes o fallas en la grabación, además tiene una excelente calidad incluso en la noche, que es el horario en que más trabajo.En cuanto a otras funciones que uso para mi trabajo, la verdad son tareas muy sencillas con apps que no requieren tanto poder de procesamiento, como: WhatsApp, Telegram, Google Drive, Google Docs,  Adobe PDF reader, Notas y grabadora de audio.Para mis momentos de ocio, he probado el equipo con los siguientes juegos: Beatstar, Call Of Duty: Mobile, Wild Rift, Pokémon Unite, Real Racing 3, Subway Surf y Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. En ninguno de los juegos he tenido pérdida de fps, ni se ha congelado la pantalla, mucho menos he experimentado ""crasheos"" o cierres inesperados de las apps. Además, el celular cuanta con un modo ""game turbo"" desde el cual pueden limpiar la caché del celular y optimizar el equipo para aumentar los FPS y/o hacerlos más estables.También he visto reseñas en las que diferentes usuarios tienen problemas con la recepción de señal, en lo personal no he tenido problemas con ninguna de sus conexiones (Wifi 5.0/4.2, Bluetooth, red TELCEL VoLTE, 4G, 4.5G y 5G) solo recuerden que la recepción, disponibilidad y la calidad de estas tecnologías dependerá de la región en donde vivan.En general, creo que es un excelente celular, tanto para trabajar como para un jugador casual, tiene muchas tecnologías y creo que cuidándolo puede durar varios años sin sentirlo rezagado por nuevas tecnologías o por falta de rendimiento.']"

Ya cuando se hizo oficial la muerte del sistema de Windows, aguanté con el teléfono hasta que pasó un buen tiempo sin recibir actualización alguna. Incluso todavía lo tengo guardado en su caja original, con todos sus accesorios, menos la funda, que se puso de color amarillo y terminó rompiéndose por el uso.A partir de ahí me encantaba probar marcas poco conocidas o de presupuesto limitado, algunas fueron muy buenas sorpresas, otras no tanto, y luego me limité a usar solo Motorola, pero siempre me quedé con el deseo de tener un equipo de esta marca en Android.Ahora bien, sobre este F95e 5G, puedo decir que se siente muy bien construído, el peso y los materiales lo hacen sentir como si fuere un equipo mucho más costoso, el diseño es sencillo pero atractivo. Incluso, cuando hice mi cambio de compañía telefónica hace unos días, lo llevé al centro de servicio, solo para asegurarme que funcionaría bien con los servicios que ofrece dicha compañía, y la chica que me atendió quedó encantada, y eso que tenían montones de teléfonos de gama alta en todas las vitrinas, no le pedía nada a ninguno de ellos.En cuanto a desempeño, este teléfono vuela en red 5G, tanto la celular como con la interior que tengo en casa, los 4GB de RAM apenas se han llenado a la mitad con todas las aplicaciones que suelo abrir, además de que, por nostalgia, instalé el lanzador de Microsoft, Bing con IA y Microsoft Start. Ya hasta hice la vinculación con mi 2 Pcs y mi laptop, ni un solo problema.Este teléfono me ha dejado un buen sabor de boca, y además tiene un detalle que me recordó al ZTE Axon 40 SE, tiene un anillo led sencillo alrededor de la lente principal de la cámara, que parapdea y hace efecto de respiración en color azul, durante la carga y para notificaciones, luce cool. Creo que esperaré a ver qué nuevo modelo sale con Android 13 en esta marca y seguro lo compro para un segundo equipo.El pedido llegó en tiempo y forma como siempre. Gracias.', ""I love the camera, but sometimes it won't focus for a min and I miss what I wanted to take a picture of. Also I've taken over 100 screenshots when I'm just trying to lock the phone... The volume button is directly across from the lock button and very touchy. Other than that, it's definitely a good phone for the price. Battery life is great. I'm on boost infinite btw and it worked as soon as I put the sim in"", 'I am not tech-savvy, but I was able to transfer my apps and pics to this new phone after I dropped and shattered my old phone.  T*mobile is my provider, relatively inexpensive and helpful setting up this phone, even though I bought the phone online.  It works just fine for me.  Subsequent usage has made me change my recommendation.  I am having to reboot this phone way too often.  I use it as my kindle substitute and maybe this is causing the problem.  I will talk to my T*Mobile people the next time we go to Billings, my nearest store..', 'En general es un buen equipo solo le critico que la configuración en pantalla en fondo y en tipo de letra las versiones anteriores era mejor la aleta se podía hacer más grande y tenía más estilos de fondo de pantalla y que se acomodaban mejor a personas con baja visión', 'I\'ve always liked BLU phones because I don\'t need a lot of bells and whistles--just a reliable, unlocked phone with a dual SIM so I can take it overseas and use another country\'s network. My previous three BLU phones have all done that at a good price (and lasted longer than my friends\' higher-priced Androids). So when my last phone finally died, I knew I wanted a 5G BLU model.Don\'t laugh, but I consider $150 the top end of what I\'ll pay for a phone, so this one fit the bill as the most economical 5G alternative. It\'s a bit larger and heftier than my last phone, which is probably partially due to the battery. I can go for a whole day with heavy use or three days with moderate use before I need a charge. The screen is clear as a bell, as is the sound. Response time from the touchscreen is lightning fast, and the apps I use (Youtube, store rewards, email, the usual) all work quickly.The things I\'m not crazy about are supposedly value-added features. The thing turns on whenever I pick it up, even if I\'m just putting it in my purse. Other reviewers have written about accidently taking screenshots by pressing the power and volume buttons at the same time. I agree the placement of the volume buttons directly opposite the power was a bad move, but I\'ve trained myself to pick the phone up from the bottom and use the fingerprint sensor so I don\'t have to press the power button. There\'s also no agreement between the volume you set for different things in Settings and what you do with the volume buttons.I was happy to get an objective opinion on my purchase as well. I took it to my T-Mobile store so they could show me how to switch out my SIM card and transfer my data. The girl who waited on me was kind enough not to call me an old person because I couldn\'t do this myself, but she was really excited by the phone. She played with it for almost fifteen minutes before asking me what brand it was and if I got it from T-Mobile. She wouldn\'t believe that it was a $150 ""no name"" phone--she has high-end products with exactly the same features selling for $800-$900.Altogether, a good phone at a reasonable price.', 'FYI that annoying blue on back of phone came be turned off. Go to settings type in light, scroll down to breathing light.', 'There is something weird going on with the  case that comes with the phone, on the back, it gets a film or something, its hard to describe it. Like if you scratch on it, back and forth, there is a whitish mark that is left behind.', ""It's a nice phone, no problems, and the price was good. Much better than the phone I was replacing."", ""Nice enough phone on the face of it when unpacked, but ....Firstly it wouldn't transfer data  directly from the old 3G BLU phone to the new one, so I had to do it via Google which took ages to get to work.First phone lasted  couple of days before it started cycling on and off and wouldn't hold a screen in place long enough to do anything.Returned straight away and ordered a replacement ... which arrived promptly.Still had to use Google to transfer data and this phone was a little better .... it lasted about 10 days before it did exactly the same as the first one .... home screen flashing on and off and no functions working. Have returned this also .... and am going to get a cheap Samsung or something instead!Return process worked OK through Amazon though!"", 'I bought this as an emergency phone because out of nowhere, my Pixel6a got the black screen of death after less than two years of use. I\'ll never buy a ""Google phone"" again (same thing happened with a Nexus many years ago - also a ""Google phone""). Before the Pixel, I had one of the  Blu Vivo+\'s and that thing lasted me 4 years until it stopped charging properly - so I was already familiar w the Blu brand.  4 good years for a $300 phone is pretty amazing.For MY needs (browsing the web, calendar, maps, texting, calling, banking, shopping, email, etc.) this phone has delivered.  As another user pointed out, my one complaint is the location of the volume keys across from the power/fingerprint key, as I keep taking unintentional screenshots.  This phone will end up being my ""Remote Work phone,"" as I am waiting to buy the Bold N3 when it comes out in a few days.  I\'ll keep buying Blu\'s until they wrong me like Google Phones have.If you\'re short on cash and what a phone that looks nice and does what most people expect from a cellphone, this is the one.']"

Very pleased with this purchase.Most phones sold here in the USA - particularly those sold by US cell carriers - are designed to operate primarily on USA cellular frequencies which makes them of limited use when traveling overseas.  This is an international phone, designed primarily to operate in other countries, many of which use common 4G and 5G bands which are not used in the USA.  But the phone has decent USA band coverage as well, so for a person like me it works well.  But the buyer should still do their homework to make sure the phone is compatible with their chosen carrier's networks and frequencies.It's also a dual-SIM phone which, for me, is a must.  When traveling internationally, I can keep my USA SIM active and simply pop in a local SIM for the country I'm in and have both lines active without having to constantly switch SIMs.  That's a great feature for international travel, and it works well.As for the phone itself - works great and fully featured for a mid-range Android.  While the phone came with Android 12, an upgrade to Android 13 was waiting and installed easily.  Very quick charging with the supplied charger and excellent battery life - especially compared to the Pixel 6 which this phone replaced.  Nice screen.  Decent camera.  128K storage is more than ample.Unlike some other phones, Xiaomi adds their own user interface layer (called MIUI) on top of the Android system, which changes the interface somewhat from native Android, but which keeps all Android features while adding some additional ones.  I quickly came to like it better than the native Android user layer.Overall - very pleased.  A lot of phone for the price."", 'Por ser um aparelho intermediário o preço poderia ser melhor.O aparelho e muito bom. bateria estar durando 2 dias (uso pouco).', 'Tengo dos meses con él y es excelente, por el precio me esperaba algo más austero pero me sorprendió, corre excelente, los juegos los corre a gráficos altos sin sobrecalentamiento ni bajones de frames, he tenido abiertas hasta 4 apps a la vez y sin ningún problema, la pantalla es súper nítida y de buen de tamaño, realizó trabajos sencillos de Excel sin problemas.

Demorei após ver análises ao escolher o telefone porque smartphones estão caros com essas configurações parrudas (256gb, 8gb, processador Snapdragon 695, 5000MaH, 48mp de câmera) para um usuário quase extremo como eu (uso para trabalho, estudos, jogar e poucas redes sociais, ler notícias e ver vídeos-aulas fora de casa)É um celular que todo mundo questiona que é uma cópia de iphone pelo fato dos menus e usabilidade da Xiaomi querer deixar parecido com o IOS? Sim e não. Por quê? é fato que o menu de tarefas da Xiaomi é idêntico ao do iphone, mas em compração a quem já trabalha com Android há muitos anos e teve experiência com diversos smartphones deste sistema, a experiência com a Xiaomi tá sendo uma das melhores e querendo ou não, bate muitas marcas por conta de entregar tudo (desempenho, bateria, memória) por um preço muito acessível independemente de sua escolha (Redmi, Poco), a experiência é incrível.""ah, mas a câmera""Beleza, a câmera do iphone é difícil de bater de frente pela Apple ser uma das melhores na câmera, mas se você não for usuário exigente por câmera que a cada espelho visto precisa tirar foto para atualizar as redes, é ok. Eu gostei, não me arrependo porque não faz diferença, não uso tanto e qualquer coisa, a beleza pode ser editada nestes filtros do Instagram. (Brincadeira)Desempenhoo desempenho não se compara, é muito bom apesar da maçã ter garantido o chipset melhor nos últimos anos e ser rápido, mas a Xiaomi entrega algo muito bom também e que espero não travar com os meses e anos de uso (Já era um usuário Motorola, o problema crônico de travamento era frequente e me estressava em um nível abissal)Jogos são interessantes de jogar no Médio, não testei no talo (configuração e desempenho máximo porque não vejo tanta necessidade) mas se for aquele usuário que quer sugar desempenho, provavelmente poderá dar uns gargalos se o multitarefa estiver aberto com tudo rodando em segundo plano e brilho no alto, além de esquentar que é uma beleza. Compre um próprio para game se for o caso pelo refrigeramento. Mas se você colocar a taxa de atualização de 60 pra 120, o negócio pode melhorar mais e não te deixar na mão na hora do FPS/CoD.No geral, poderemos utilizar o celular por um bom tempo.Bateria5000Mah com carregador de 33w.. Não preciso nem dizer nada né? Entrega desempenho dentro do esperado para 1 dia, mas o carregamento de 30 minutos, já supre suas necessidades mais corriqueiras em caso de emergencia. Minha dica é: sempre SEMPRE carregue um powerbank ou carregador original na bolsa porque telefone é igual remédio, essencial. Ainda mais se você estiver com pressa e esquecer de carregar o telefone no dia anterior.A bateria carrega tão rápido que se você esquecer 30mins, ele estará cheio. O recomendado é você deixar de 30% a 90% e não a noite toda pela velocidade que o celular oferece.No mais, excelente celular.', 'Comprei para dar de presente ao meu esposo. O celular é bom pelo preço, entrega o que promete e a bateria é boa porém meu esposo já está vendo que ele está dando umas travadas, está aquecendo um pouco… mas pelo valor não dá pra exigir muito do celular. Pra uso de redes sociais e WhatsApp um bom celular pra quem não quer investir muito.', 'O celular chegou em 3 dias, estava muito ansiosa para saber se é bom mesmo.O celular em sí é bom, para jogar CoD roda lisinho, a camêra deixa a desejar mas eu já esperava, pois a xiaomi investiu mais na versão Pro.Só tem a saída do som por um lado, por isso achei que seria baixo, mas o som é satisfatório. O que me surpreendeu negativamente foi a bateria, pelo que eu ouvi falar prometia uma durabilidade alta, mas não dura muito não. Mas para o meu uso diário que tenho sempre tomadas a minha volta não interfere tanto.No geral é um celular bom, rápido, não trava e a camêra quebra um galho. Estou satisfeita com a compra. Mas quem tiver a oportunidade compre a versão Pro, a diferença é pouca de valor e tem mais a oferecer.', 'Gostei muito do celular estou usando e até o momento está me atendendo muito bem tive um pequeno problema para reconhecer o chip mas eu mesmo resolvi agora ele está perfeito qto ao vendedor muito bom produto chegou no dia marcado.', 'O produto veio muito bem embalado e a entrega do aparelho foi em menos tempo do que foi estipulado.O smartphone traz todas as características e configurações conforme as descrições.

Eu estranhei demais excluí vários fora os que desativei por não conseguir excluir. A câmera é boa pra quem NÃO GOSTA DE TIRAR FOTOS. Ou seja: se vc ama tirar fotos ESSE NÃO É O CELULAR PRA VC. O carregador vem com aquele pino chato que não usa mais no Brasil, tive que comprar um adaptador. Fora isso é um telefone normal se estivesse custando 1300~ 1450 o custo benefício era maior. Eu não pagaria 1650 nele, procuraria algo melhor. Ah! O melhor Review que achei dele foi o do CanalTech. A bateria dura um dia e meio, se a pessoa usa pouco capaz de durar 2 dias.Na caixa vem capa e uma proteção na tela que eu julgo ser uma pseudo película que eu não retirei por não atrapalha em nada o uso.', 'Celular cumpre com tudo que está descrito.O som é bem baixo, pois não é estéreo, mas eu já sabia, só um aviso mesmo pra quem for comprar sem saber.Mas para mim ele esta perfeito!!', 'Celular sem nenhuma mudança do vendendo sendo original, entra oque é dito no anúncio e foi muito rápido(não compre o celular buscando uma câmera boa, só desempenho ele tem.)', 'O produto veio antes do prazo, solicitei a nf postriormente, por não te-la localizado, minha falta de conhecimento adequado do portal, más foi enviada pelo vendedor, excelente atendimento.']"

It has an amazing battery life, screen, responsiveness and charging speeds that still amaze me.Being able to charge my phone at an absurd rate to 100% and then also getting at least six hours of screen on use despite the most suboptimal scenario (5g, High refresh rate and display settings maxed) is a game changer and quickly dispels any concerns about the lack of wireless charging.I can't fault the phone for it's beefed up and tactile vibration feedback, sound quality and display quality. But now for the downsides.The software is snappy out of the box but then does feel a little clunky or unresponsiveness randomly. This, I believe, is down to how the phone starts to learn which apps you use frequently, which ones it needs to not keep in memory and general system optimisations.Remedying this is simple enough, do some research into settings to turn off like ram boost, animation timing and other things to keep it feeling snappy.Comign from an older oxygen os version I feel they have lost a lot of the efficiency. So much so that there isn't a huge amount of responsiveness difference between this and my old one plus 7 pro. I however, welcome the amazing battery life that the 8 gen 2 offers and yes it will handle pretty much everything without slow down.For longevity I went with the larger ram and storage version. Just because 12 gb of ram is ideal to keep pretty much any reasonable amount of apps in memory (no power user can really multitask that much on a phone).The other major major downside is how uneasy you feel holding this phone without a case. Soemthing about the ergonomics and glass back make this so slippery. Just resting in your hand it slips, I had to scavenge some grip tape for the few days I didn't have a case just because of this.So definitely get a case and that's then completely resolved.Cameras. Another one that one plus haven't made huge leaps in. They've instead delegated much of the quality to in built filters and ai processing. Which maybe fine but the raw ability of the camera has to stand alone to produce reliably good, share worthy images. Something that they actually had done really well on op7.The overall verdict. It's a buy at this price and represents unbeatable value without compromise. Overall I am very happy with it. It's short comings for me could be fixed is subsequent software updates. But as we all know we can't rely on one plus to deliver efficiencies but thank fully can rely on them to support android updates - however well or badly they are implemented."", 'This year alone I\'ve owned a Samsung S23 Ultra but found the phone too big and OneUI very bloated with lots of applications being duplicated that Google have already.I also owned a Google Pixel 7 Pro although the camera was excellent the operating system was ""bare boned"" you couldn\'t even remove the search bar or glance widgets on the home screen. What\'s the point of having an Android phone if Google dictates what you can and can\'t do on your phone...it reminds me of another rival OEM and OS.So I tried the OnePlus 11 and was very pleasantly surprised. After a long hiatus (the last OnePlus phone I owned was the McLaren 6T) and I\'m aware that Oxygen OS is no longer what it used to be and many OnePlus purists have been annoyed as it has taken on traits of Oppo\'s ColorOS and not forged an identity of its own. That worried me when I first bought the phone however I can unequivocally say that the OP11 is a fine return to form for the company. The phone is blazing fast and has the ever reliable SD 8 Gen 2 chip although throttled by OnePlus it performs like a champ in day to day use. The camera system takes great pictures agreed that the output isn\'t Samsung or Google flagship standards but the pictures are nothing to be sniffed at.The battery life is in a class of its own and can easily last me two days with moderate use and be topped up in 30 mins due to the bundled 100W SuperVooc charger.""OxygenOS"" is on point I\'d even go so far to say that it\'s up there alongside the latest iteration of Nothing OS which IMHO is my favourite Android skin.Don\'t hesitate buying this phone it\'s amazing value for money for what it offers.

The One Plus 11 does all this and comes with a charger, unlike any other phones in today's market.A con would be the software. It was difficult to find options that my previous phone made easy i.e. notifications do not say what the app is notifying me about.Some of the gestures are difficult to pull off and with no visible buttons to go home or to open a screen to navigate though all open apps, I find myself flicking multiple times to perform one action.I should mention, it does not come with a case and it really needs one to feel substantial. There are also not a lot of options available online.Note: When purchasing from Amazon, a password needs to be given to the driver upon delivery. This makes it difficult to be delivered to an office reception and impossible through an Amazon locker."", ""Not many apps match the descriptions, and the color matches the description, but I had higher expectations for the photo quality. The battery life is not great; currently, I need to charge it twice daily, and it seems to be getting shorter each day. However, the charger works perfectly and can fully charge the phone in just 30 minutes.There aren't many ringtone options to choose from, and some of them are different from what my Samsung had.

I can go through my entire day without worrying about charging it constantly. It's a game-changer for sure!I've heard some people comparing it to Color OS, but honestly, it's Oxygen OS and is packed with awesome features. The split-screen functionality using the side bar is just so intuitive and easy to use, much like Samsung's One UI.The camera might not be as good as those on the Galaxy S23 Ultra or Pixel 7 Pro, but honestly, I'm more than satisfied with it. It captures some decent shots, and I haven't had any complaints so far.It doesn't break the bank like the Galaxy S23 Ultra does! Why pay more when the OnePlus 11 offers almost everything you need at a fraction of the cost?Also with a promise of 4 years of updates, OnePlus has really won me over. It's even longer than what Google Pixel offers, and that's saying something (if you ever keep the phone for 4 years!)There's no wireless charging or IP68 rating, but that's not a big deal for me. The 100W charging (UK) is insanely fast, so I never worry about running out of juice. As for the IP68 rating, who really takes their phone fully submerged?!All in all, the OnePlus 11 has been an absolute delight to use. It ticks all the right boxes for me - long-lasting battery, impressive OS features, and a reliable camera. Plus, it saves me some serious money compared to other flagship phones. It's definitely a choice you won't regret."", 'Great price, fast delivery.Just upgraded from the 8 Pro to the 11.Battery life is outstanding!

Wouldn't use it without a case if you care about scratches on that camera lens.

Congrats to OnePlus for getting back into the affordable flagship game."", ""I bought this as it was on a special pay monthly deal, I had a galaxy s23 ultra, but had to sell it due to car problems.Don't get me wrong, this ticks a lot of boxes that the s23 ultra has, but once you've had the best, others just don't compare.Camera is great, so is the battery life, I use nova launcher and sometimes it's glitchy, software updates aren't as quick and as often as Samsung.The big let down is lack of wireless charging. I'm a sucker for just placing my phone down on my charger at night, instead now I have to plug it in........ Real world problems I know.

Overall I'm very happy with it. It's quick, has a good battery, good camera, etc. It's hard to find a good screen protector, I've gone through about 6 and I haven't had the phone for a year yet. Once part of the screen looked like I had cracked it and went black but when I restarted it went away. The fingerprint sensor is reliable when used with the protector that comes installed from the factory, but isn't as good with aftermarket ones. It isn't always easy to find settings for individual apps, it feels like some are missing. Still, for the price and quality of the hardware, I recommend it."", ""I was convinced to buy this phone after seeing the photos  my daughter got with hers.what i dont like is no SD card  for extra storage.256GB is OK  BUT migrating from a well used established phone with its files doesnt leave me a lot for the photos i will be generating with this.it appears the phone DOES come with a screen protector  on it. i didn't realize that and installed a second party screen protector, which caused a lot of issues which was quite frustrating, for instance  the phone was near impossible to catch a phone call as the screen was not awakened on a incoming call.  the touch sensitivity was not responsive and always misspelling and changing  my typing, I spent a lot of time correcting the spelling of my work.... again extremely frustrating.  after i observed the dirt that had collected under the protector, i decided to change it. and then is when i observed that there seemed to be a second one  i did not know existed. ......... soooo......after installing a new protector all these issues went away. it has caused me to retract all the bad things i had murmured about this fine cellphone/camera  with a poor interface.I still wish it had Micro SD capability a TB of extra memory, that would make me contented to a high level.when i initially set it up and transferred the old phone to new, i was surprised at the speed of which all the data i wanted was moved.  photos, videos, all other documents. However it lacked the bookmarks of my preferred browser.i like the way it manages the battery usage, notifies me when an app is using too much and sends me to the settings to tweek its permission and usage the phone / system Shuts down apps that have not been used in a few months and removing permissions. I am not sure if it is the new version of android but, it is keeping things  controlled instead of snowballing into a big mess that is hard to resolve later and running the devise into  high inefficiency.as for charging it is  screaming  fast. it has a setting that will take its time also  I believe it is good to avoid  baking the battery every time  you charge. and there are several times i have gone 2 days of use before running the battery low.as for the camera. i love the interface and the optical quality for a cell phone is astounding. even zoomed in the pictures maintain a fair level of quality. as opposed to my past phones that would zoom  but produced images that resembled impressionist paintings.  the portraits of people  and snapshots of random things always please. I cannot wait till the northern lights are visible here in the Alaskan skies.I will however retain my dslr equipment for  the money shots....I caught this on sale for $699 which is the most i have paid for a cell phone  ever.I love the freedom I have from the control of the famous fruit company phone, and the huge cost they sell their new model for... ouchfor me it was a big step up from the Blu phones, which I last bought the  F91 5G is no slouch  the camera couldnt do well in low light, but to its advantage it was fast,  and i have a 512GB Mico SD  on top of the 256 internal.  at $199 (Sale price )  but the camera sucked. so i GEEKED out and use both  cell phones for different uses.Thats all I can say for now.all the best to you and good luck"", ""I see many mentions of this is just as good as the s23U. That's just not true, I have both.First, if someone was to hand me this phone(op11) and say I could only use this phone I would be pretty happy. It's a good phone.  Screen is pretty vibrant and bright enough. The camera takes good photos in most situations. Performance is fast and charging is incredibly fast. You wouldn't regret owning this phoneNow I have both this and the s23u and I can tell you the s23U is either a little bit better or much better than the OnePlus 11 in everything except charging.The s23U's screen is much more sharper, better dynamic range and brighter. The colors are more accurate.The camera processing is better. It handles poor lightning conditions better. The images are more detailed and sharper. The self camera is better in every way than i on the OnePlus 11. The zoom capabilities that the OnePlus just can't come close to.I wish found the Bluetooth audio better on the s23ultra and it was noticeable.That being said the OnePlus 11 is a great phone."", 'This is the most beautiful phone I\'ve ever seen or held.I have both the OP11 and\xa0 S23 Ultra at home for personal comparison.The way I stream,\xa0 Netflix, Tiktok, Youtube (2-3+ hrs daily), with almost the highest settings in every category (refresh, resolution, brightness, etc) the OP11 battery\xa0 noticeably outlasts the S23. When charging, the S23 took about 1.1/2 hour and was still not 80% using a MacBook charger. The OP11 charge time is around 25 min to 100%!!When taking a random pic of my living room\xa0 using both phones, - I thought something might be wrong with the S23 in comparison (not kidding). I\'m not a camera/ telephoto freak, so the crazy camera abilities touted on S23 are lost on me.The OP11 UI is attractive and exciting making the S23s seem utilitarian.\xa0No heat issues, quality seems impeccable, performance all outstanding on both phone. I have queried OP support on one issue, the ability to turn on/ off Airplane/ Bluetooth modes with the screen locked. They responded within two days as promised. Even if someone were to steal and turn on Airplane mode the phone is useless to them, also ""Find My Device"" will record the phones location the moment Airplane mode is switched off..My only REAL misgivings are the auto brightness (way too dim), and the outdoor brightness (not quite enough - for me).The\xa0 S23 w/ 512g storage/ 12g memory $1400, the OnePlus11 w/ 256g/ 16g memory\xa0 $649!!Having said all of this, - because of the brightness issue alone (the most important criteria to me, along with battery and charging time), I am going wait until FEB/ MARCH of 2024 when the OP12 is released, as it addresses the brightness issue (from 1350 nitts to over 2000 nitts, the S23 is 1750 nitts and S24 purportedly around 2500 nitts).Certainly the price will go up - for both phones.Obviously these are my findings and opinions.', 'Unfortunately phone was not compatible with my insulin pump otherwise would have kept.  beautiful fast phone', ""I've been an Android enthusiast since the first Android phone was available here, the HTC Dream/Google G1, I've run custom firmware, and tweaked the bejesus out of my devices, so I think I know a thing or two.This phone is absolutely top-notch. High spec hardware that works great, in a beautiful, slickly designed package. The Oneplus 11 will hang with any of the current gen Samsungs or Pixel Pro in just about any way. The camera performance may not test quite as highly as a current Galaxy S Ultra or Pixel Pro, but the cameras are very good and very close! Beautiful screen, blazing fast performance, 16gb RAM, and all the 5G and LTE bands you need for any US carrier, so what's not to like?I've found the battery life to be very good, as I still have at least 50% left when I get home from work. And as for charging, WOW, this thing charges ridiculously fast with the included charger - faster than just about anything else out there, and most phones don't even come with a charger anymore. Igo from 40-50% to full in almost no time. I did turn off the Wise charging feature though because I couldn't figure out how to set it up, and its mystery schedule didn't jibe with my super early wake up time.The lack of wireless charging seems unthinkable for an otherwise incredible flagship-level phone in 2023, and I have no idea why they omitted it. This is unforgivable, although I will say that with the battery life and super fast charging I can get by without wireless. This need not be a deal breaker even if you must have it, since wireless adaptors are all over Amazon for like $12.I have found some negative aspects of this phone, albeit minor ones I can live with. For one, the phone is beautifully designed but very slippery in the hand. You're going to protect your investment with a case anyway though, aren't you? I found a nice clear TPU one that shows it off will protecting it a bit and adding enough grip to make me comfortable. And I do wish the screen was flat rather than curved. I see no benefit to the curved edges, which can cause glare at some angles and lighting conditions, and they make screen protectors and cases a little difficult to engineer perfectly.The fingerprint sensor is my only other gripe. It works, but I have yet to find an under-screen sensor, whether ultrasonic or optical, that works as reliably and quickly as I'd like. Moto nails it with their side-mounted sensor on the power button of some recent phones, and I loved what LG did when the had it in the center of the BACK of their phones. My glass screen protector is probably partially to blame, but the sensor wasn't perfect with the factory-applied TPU cover, either. This has prompted me to finally try face unlock, which Oneplus has done a good job with, admittedly.All in all, I love this phone. It is probably the best Android device I've owned, surpassing even the LG V30 and Samsung s10 5G, which were my favorites in their respective heydays. The Oxygen OS interface isn't as intuitive as stock Android, and some people really don't like recent incarnations of it, but I don't have a problem with it. Full disclosure: the first thing I do with any Android device is install Nova launcher and the same basic setup I've been using for several years, so manufacturers' launchers are irrelevant to me, but Oxygen OS is fine with me otherwise and Oneplus bloatware is minimal.6/5 stars, GREAT phone with very competitive pricing for what you get."", 'Personalmente me gustó mucho el teléfono y sus sístema operativo es el más reciente 2023 ,es un gran celular, no tiene ninguna falla ,super fluido audio super bueno !!!

I love the easy customization of Android system and seamless synchronization with PC Windows and my Google suite (I am a heavy PC and Google app user).  And my smart home is Google based which works better with Android. But I hate the fact that Android phone/system gets sluggish after a while.  I hate everything about iPhone but I do think iPhone/iOS has better optimization and provides a smoother experience.OnePlus 11 5G is a great Android phone and I have yet to find any main shortcomings. It is slick, fast, powerful and has a lot of features.  It accepts both fingerprint and facial recognition, which is very convenient.  The screen looks amazing. The color is vivid. The camera is top-notch. Since it's Android, it supports all kinds of audio codecs. I am able to listen to music at either LDAC or aptX quality on my bluetooth headphones while iPhone will restrict me to AAC.  I am also a business person who travels often in different parts of the world and needs to switch sim card.  The dual sim card slots make my life a lot easier.  There are several useful features built in the operating system such as split screen, floating screen etc., making working on my phone a lot easier.The fast charging is great. A full charge can last a whole day without any issue. This is amazing considering that I am a heavy phone user. However, I wish it was equipped with wireless charging.  This may be the only shortcoming I found so far.Overall I am very happy with this phone so far.  Great job, OnePlus!  I just hope that OnePlus won't be banned by the US government again one day like what they did to Huawei since OnePlus is also a Chinese company."", ""This phone wants to change your permissions and will have a pop-up coming up every 5 minutes because of something created deep in security permissions.

It has exceeded my hopes for a phone that does the basics stuff well.  Call quality is very good, it runs well for everything I need it for.  If you have young eyes and 20/20 vision the small screen might be OK.  It is not a gamer or video viewer though it does function well but the size will limit your usage.  Texting is a challenge but I haven't touch texted in a while with Google assistant as good as it is so that function is usable.  Works great with Android Auto, Google Messages for Web.  Camera is OK but for $150 it will do the trick as I don't use my phone for much photo shooting but it does work.  I leave the artsy photo stuff to my wife!  Battery is OK as I get to 40-50% by end of day so not problem getting a whole day.  But because of the size I don't spend much time YouTubing or other video stuff.  A little chunky but all those innards have to go somewhere.  Highly recommend if you are looking for a phone that you can carry any where and not have it pull down your pants!!""]"

The only issue I have had so far is with getting this masterpiece to do wifi calling, but I have this same problem with my Galaxy S20 Plus and was able to figure out how to get it working and I have high hopes that the same will happen here. I have tried the moon zoom and it was spectacular. I love the size of this phone though I wish Samsung had at least made it the same size as the Galaxy S22 Ultra which is 6.9 inches, but however I can still work with 6.8 inches. I love the bigger screen phones because they are better for conducting business on the go and of course videos, movies and photography. Love the brightness of the screen and need I not mention the S Pen which I always wanted. Though it\'s true that this phone is pretty expensive, still, all in all it\'s worth every single penny for everything thing that has been put into it including hours of labor and time. I didn\'t want to upgrade my Galaxy S20 Plus this soon, but after seeing the moon zoom and the fact that this phone featured the popular S Pen, I have no other choice but to dive in, besides life is too short to not have the things we work hard for, so with that said I pampered myself to this device that I hope to have for many years to come. I seen in the reviews where someone stated that the phone will not charge past 85 percent. Go to settings, battery and device care followed by battery and then more battery setting and turn off the protect battery setting if you want your device to charge the entire 100 percent. However keep in mind that keeping this setting turned on increase the life of your battery when it only charges to 85 percent. Sound quality has also improved once again in this device and that is something that I love as well. I guess the even better part is the updates that is going to hopefully follow to put the icing on the cake because, as far as the hardware..... it\'s all there. Samsung has even stepped up their game and threw in McAfee on this one, so with that said, I stepped mine\'s up as well and bought the package deal from McAfee that will protect up to 10 devices. People, you ain\'t going to get better than this. This phone is super fast. I\'m going to miss the memory card slot but just like the headphones port, I\'ll get over it quickly for all that this phone packs, I say so long memory card slot, welcome home Galaxy S23 Ultra.Update: 5/28/23.After having this phone longer, I\'ve discovered more about it. The Bluetooth feature in this device is much faster than the one on my S20 Plus. My Galaxy Watch now connects instantly, where in my S20 Plus it took a few seconds to connect. I have been loving this phone so much that I have decided to replace the original plastic S Pen that came with it with the aluminum one to do my own part of keeping high-end products matched up with high-end products as I did with the case, going with the Otterbox Defender series pro case for this baby. I\'ve heard people mention having dropped calls on Samsung phones, however I have not experienced that in this device this far into ownership. The photo of the Cellular Tower I took using the camera on this phone was taken from about a mile and some change away and I was zoomed to around 30mm out of 100, just to give you a better idea of what the camera on this device can do. I am very tickle with the benchmark results of this device, very, very beautiful results. Still waiting to see what it will do with a full moon not to mention the very popular ""Super Moon"". After using this phone for nearly two months now I still must say that it has been an amazing experience. I have also noticed where some are unfairly reviewing the phone, either you have a defective device or is not doing something right. The battery should be no less than 5 stars, and I personally would give it 10 stars if I could for being a perfect 10. I have gotten at least 4 days out of my phone off a single charge, I have also noticed where the fingerprint scanner got an unfair low rating, again if you use it right it will work right. Since setting this area of the phone up I have not once had any problems with the fingerprint scanner picking up my fingerprint, even when I have done it snappy it has never failed to work. So far on this device, I have not experienced any of the dropped calls that I hear about since the very moment I inserted my sim card into this phone. At last, I was able to take a few photos of the popular supermoon. Wasn\'t that clear of an evening here but I still must say that the camera on this phone did an awesome job capturing it at 230mm and around 7mp.', ""Okay okay so you know what you're buying this phone for: the camera.  Or perhaps lots of other reasons too, but hot dang, the camera though.  I'd say as a professional DSLR photographer that this is as close as it gets to having pro capabilities on a phone, but that it's still not quite there yet.  On a DSLR you've got quite a big dynamic range of light and dark and color and everything in between that gets snapped with a photo, whereas on this phone it's probably cut in half... but it's still the best dang thing we've got in the form of a phone.  I find myself actually snapping more phone pics than Nikon DSLR pics these days honestly, since I bought this thing.Otherwise?  Processing power is bar-none speedy as.  Far better than the iPhones I've been toting everywhere for years.  Interface is easy to figure out, even if you're indoctrinated to the Apple world.  Storage space is big (on the 512GB), and I back up on MS OneDrive, so it's no biggie anyway.  Lots of apps to choose from since Android is kinda like how Windows is to OSX in terms of what's available to you.  Screen is a monster which is awesome for visibility and workability, but is still just fine in a standard pocket and doesn't feel cumbersome.  Wi-fi adapter is snappy.  S-Pen is super cool!  Audio is bomber.I suppose my only complaints are:(1) that the 'adaptive brightness' mode is obnoxious in that it does work well to alter screen brightness per lighting situation but it sucks that the brightest the phone can get is only available in that particular mode... so if you're in changing lighting situations and you're annoyed that it won't just be bright all the time, deal with it.  This is the pits with certain photography situations when under shadowfall.(2) The phone wants to automatically send text messages via RCS or whatever which is wi-fi only and so sometimes if you or the recipient is not on wi-fi at the moment the text fails to send.  Sometimes you have no idea when this has happened until later when you see a note that 'message has failed to send.' Ugh.  You can however set options in text threads to 'SMS only' which is via 4G only.(3) This isn't really an issue with the product so much as an issue with current tech, but a sort of 'buyer beware' notice: the aperture on these phone cameras is so shallow that it compares like a candle to the sun in terms of all around image focus per phone to DSLR quality.  I will say I am tremendously impressed with how far phone cameras have come, but that it is still wounding that phones can't overcome this obstacle.Anyway, buy this thing.  You will NOT regret buying this thing.  That is all."", 'Vengo de un celular OnePlus 5T (de adelante sera referido como OP5T)  que lo adquiri en el 2015. Hay varias cosas que no me han terminado de agradar a la hora de cambiarme de telefono.Cosas que me gustaron:1. LA CAMARA. Totalmente increible. Soy mucho de tomarle fotos a las estrellas, luna, paisajes e insectos. Realmente valio la pena comprarlo por esto.2. Al jugar juegos que incluso son muy exigentes, no se calienta para nada3. La pantalla. No se como describirlo, pero tiene mucha nitidez, aunque no es muy brillosa. Ademas, como pro y contra, es demasiado demasiado lisa, es comodo usarlo, pero resbala, lo cual en ciertos juegos puede perjudicarCosas que me disgustaron:1. La huella dactilar esta en la pantalla frontal, mientras que en el OP5T esta en la parte de atras, con una cavidad. A la hora de usar la huella, cuesta encontrar correctamente donde poner el dedo, teniendo que realizar varios intentos antes de acertarle, mientras que en el OP5T al tener la cavidad, facilmente podias sentir que estabas colocando bien el dedo.2. El reconocimiento facial demora bastante a comparacion del OP5T y lo peor es que al dia de hoy, una vez reconocido no hay modo de quitar la pantalla de bloqueado, entonces debes esperar a que te reconozca y hacer swipe para desbloquear si usas este metodo3. El celular pesa muchisimo, un poco menos del doble que el OP5T, hasta cierto punto es cansado sostenerlo.4. No trae cargador, solamente cable USB C a USB C y esto fue un dolor de cabeza para mi porque tuve que incurrir a un gasto extra ya que no tengo ningun cargador de USB C5. El sonido es relativamente bajo6. Por el precio, hubiera sido bueno agregarle un protector y/o un case7. Para tomar screenshots es un poco complicado. Mientras que en el OP5T tenia el boton de apagado en un lado y el de volumen en el otro lado, estos estan del mismo lado, lo cual se me hace un poco incomodo de presionar para tomar screenshot. Y si es usando gesto, debes pasar todo la palma, lo cual tampoco se me hace practico. En OP5T puedes deslizar tres dedos de arriba hacia abajo para tomar screenshot.', ""I finally broke down and got a Samsung. For many many years my phone brand has always been LG. I have always found LG phones to be the best value for money. They pioneered features way before other brands; like tap to wake. They performed just as well as iPhone and Samsung but for much less money. But unfortunately LG left the smartphone market a couple of years ago and my LG V60 was finally showing it's age. I was finally forced to get something that wasn't LG for the first time in almost 2 decades. I was set and ready to get the one plus 11 and I had even purchased it and everything. The next day I discovered it had no water resistance rating nor wireless charging. One by itself wouldn't have been a deal breaker but lacking both features in tandem are unfortunately. Once I realized that, I cancelled my order for the One Plus. Normally I wouldn't consider Samsung, as they are just as expensive as Apple, but I did come across some really good deals on Prime day. I had considered the the 23 Ultra but was concerned about the overall size and I wouldn't use the stylus; so for me the price premium wasn't worth it. So I went for the 512GB 23+. I use my phone a lot during the day so I wanted a phone with plenty of storage and processing power. So far it's been working great; very speedy, feature rich, user friendly, and responsive. My cell reception seems to be better and it connects to all my devices well. My one gripe is the face recognition and fingerprint reader usually don't work the first time, which is annoying. I wish they would use a dedicated sensor and not an in-screen reader. Other than that the phone is a good choice and a good value considering I got a pretty good deal on it. So far, Samsung seems to be a good alternative to LG."", ""I'm totally blind! I got this to replace my old S21 cell phone. For the most part, I like Samsung Galaxy devices do to the louder external speaker over other devices like iPhones.But anyway when I got this phone; The button layout are in the same arangement as my old phone. For me, that was a plus. The external speaker running the Same TTS along with Talkback doesn't seem to be as clear to me. It sounds like it is a little muffeled and a little lower in volume even with the same settings as my S21 like when in a pocket.When charging the phone; The charging spead doesn't look to be much improved. You would think going from an 25W (S21) to and 45W (S23 plus) you would see a large difference on charging time. But looks to be only about 15 minutes or so difference. Yes a totally blind person needs to have the phone on to know how the phone is doing as far as charging otherwise the screen reader will not work. I do like the faster charging being I don't have to wait as long even that it is only 15 or so minutes faster. But again, this is an larger battery. Speaking of the battery! I get about 2 days and more on a charge. The old phone I was getting about 1.5 days. I mainly use my phone to make and  receive calls. I keep the screen off being a totally blind person doesn't need that function on to suck power. But running the external speaker takes as much power to run as the screen does! lol.As far as turning on the phone to me seams to take as long as the old S21 to startup. This phone does work on AT&T network even on 5G. The bad thing is you cannot lock it to 5G only! But I'm guessing that this is do to Samsung and AT&T having an agreement that the phone must be set to Auto and the user cannot control that. Same goes if you are having trouble with cell signal quality and you want to use Wi-Fi calling! As long as you have an cell signal coverage! Wi-Fi calling will not work. Again AT&T not wanting  people to use that as long as you are on there network. Other devices like Apples; Allow you to do that being they told AT&T you aren't going to do that."", ""I've never have a phone so quick, smooth, easy to use, and high quality. I do storm damage inspections on homes every day for work and I use this phone to take photos, so good quality photos is definatily required. You definitely pay for it with it for how much it costs, but quality products aren't cheap and cheap products have no quality. If I had to purchase again I would probably go with the same phone without the smart pen. It's difficult to learn how to use. Especialy if youve never used a smart pen before. It seems impractable, but I'm just a late boomer born in the 1990s, so if you've used smart pens in the past and like them, then just ignore me.9.9/10 product."", ""The only reason I decided to replace my S8 was that the battery couldn't make it through a day even after having been replaced. I picked this phone because it has a small form factor similar to the S8 and can do induction charging unlike the A series. I did a direct comparison of battery usage between my S8 and the s23, and after being used equally for many hours, the S8 was down to 23% and the S23 was at 63%. One nice feature of this phone is that you can set an upper limit for charging, which supposedly protects the battery. Mine is currently set to stop charging at 85%.My biggest complaint about switching to this phone is the limitations for transferring apps. First of all, the transfer process takes a very, very long time, and none of the login information or passwords transfers, so you have to log into each app and, in some cases, go through a few additional steps. In this regard, I have to admit that Apple is the best company out there: you can transfer from one phone to another and immediately have the new phone do everything the old phone did without any glitches.I would also say that the phone is too expensive. It would be a bargain at half the price. Again, the only reason I bought it was that my S8 couldn't make it through the day anymore. Otherwise, I don't think the features of this phone are in any way superior."", ""I got this phone on sale, $200 off, 256gb version. Samsung doesnt offer a 128gb version on the ultra, which is bogus in my opinion. Amazon prime offered same day shipping, which was nice. Phone arrived intact and fine. No problems with shipping.The build quality of the S23 Ultra is very solid and feels good in the hands. The matte finish on the back is very nice and smooth, leaves no fingerprints. The screen feels really good and smooth. The s pen is nice to have, but I find that I dont use it that much. Its nice when taking photos you can set up the phone and press the s pen button to take the photo when youre ready. Speaking of the camera, the photos are excellent quality. This phone is equipped with a 200mp camera, which takes some very detailed and clear photos. I would say this phone has the best camera compared to every other phone. This phone is equipped with a 5000 mah battery, which lasts the whole day. The fingerprint sensor works 98% of the time, when my hand is very dry it doesnt work as well. I havent tested facial recognition yet so I cant speak on that. The screen is 120 hz, and looks and feels very smooth.The android skin this phone uses, OneUI, is one of the better android skins on the market. The customization of this phone is way better than IOS in my opinion, you can do so much more. One thing I dislike about the os is that after every time i swipe up to exit an app, the samsung quick access wallet app pops up in place of the spot where I use to swipe to exit apps. I find this very annoying and I'm not sure where to disable it. One other thing I dislike is this phone requires you to have two different accounts with Google and Samsung, whereas with iPhone, all you need is an icloud account.Screen protectors are hard to put on this phone because of the curved edges, so be mindful of that.Overall, this is a VERY solid flagship device, if youre in the market for a new cell phone, this is the phone to buy."", ""This phone is huge and weighs in a good bit more than my last phone.  Battery life seems to be about the same as what I had.  Lots to be said about this phone.Camera is pretty dang nice.  There are some strange 'glitches' when it transfers between lenses.  Even though this is Android and I have been using Android, there is a ton to learn to use the camera.Screen is very clean and nice.Finger print reader  with a screen protector is kind of hit and miss.  The detectors is behind the screen.  Not sure how they work that magic but its kind of cool.  Make sure you set your pin first.Reception.  This seems to be pretty good on t mobile.  I was able to just take my sim card from my old phone and insert it into this phone... no need to go to the store to transfer the account.  Copied the data from my old phone using a usb cable in 10ish minutes.  No problems there.All the critical apps seem to be working like before.  Some needed to be re-setup.  Had to reconnect to our WIFI networks.Very disappointed that you cannot use a micro-SD card.  Especially when you see the price difference to get something like 1T of storage.  Its a bit ridiculous to have a 200 M pixel camera and not allow for user supplied storage.  In fact, its really really lame.The weight and size of the camera takes a bit to get used to.  Its only like an inch longer and 1/3 inch wider, but wow what a difference that makes.The speaker(s) are really good.  There is kind of a spatial sound on this phone.The phone is pretty fast for everything I have done, processor wise.The s-pen its really cool...i have been using it as a remote trigger for the phone.The phone surface is pretty slick (as in a little slippery) so I highly recommend a  case.Magsafe is a cool feature.  There is a magnetic attachment point over the wireless charging.  With the right case, you can do several things with this, like attach a second battery with no wires, just by placing it behind the case.  You can add a kick-stand, wallet, etc.Customization is pretty solid on the phone.  Seems like you can customize pretty much anything.Blutooth pairing is pretty simple and have had no problems here.Overall, this is a good phone.  Plan on taking a week or so to explore all the different features."", ""Had the phone for a good 2 as of writing this. First off the size. Poor Decision on my end, should've got the plus version of this phone. The screen is 5.9 inches and I'm used to my old S20 FE's 6.7 inch screen. But I do like how I have snuggly hold it in one hand now. Also the battery life is pretty good too. The thing can last a full day for me doing normal stuff. The Adaptive Battery is really something. Also I can finally make use of Super Fast Charging. (My old phone was on the verge of dying, so I never had the ability to use that feature.) But the yeah phone is nice. Please treat it with care and get yourself a case while you're at it. Oh and the phone came fully unlocked. So much so when I started it up, it had a list of providers it supported. I 611 on metro did the phone transfer and got my new phone connected in minutes. The thing that as is a nice bonus I think is the 5G UC. But I need to stress test that. Supposedly you get smoother reception with the antenna in crowded areas. Not too sure about though. But I live in Miami. Perfect Environment for a Stress test. 😅Side Note: I using Amazon Monthly Payments for mine. I'm broke. But I mean, I did before with my laptop I got last winter. I can do it again with a new galaxy phone. Don't know what the stigma is with some people saying it's a bad thing. For me it's a god send.""]"

The only thing that bothered me when camping is that my smartphone\'s battery would die rather quickly, leaving me without a source of light or a camera if I want to take pictures while camping.With that in mind, I looked for and decided to give this WP20 Pro Rugged Smartphone a try. Upon arrival, the phone came in this much larger box that you typically don\'t see for smartphones now a days. Upon opening the box and looking at the contents within, I was rather pleased. This phone comes with a few things that most major flagship phones no longer have; a 3.5mm headphone jack with it\'s own protective cover as seen in one of my photos and a charger in the box. I\'m not sure why major smartphone makers are getting rid of these features, but I\'m glad to seem them available for this rugged smartphone.After taking the phone out of the box and powering it up, it didn\'t take long to get to the initial setup page. This phone is definitely heavier than most typical smartphones, but that\'s understandable considering what this phone is made for and the hefty 6300mAh battery that it has.For those who have used Android in the past, you will be very familiar with the setup process for this smartphone. Like many other phones, you have access to enroll your fingerprints or setup Face Unlock to unlock your phone with your finger or your face. It also has features such as NFC for making payments while on the go. With Android 12 built-in, you get all the newer feature of one of the most recent versions of Android. Such as Privacy controls where you know when your microphone or camera is being used by one of your applications. The ""Material You"" design language is amazing since the phone will adapt to your preferences, such as using the colors of your background to apply them to the color of your navigation bar, volume control buttons, just to name a few.One random feature I didn\'t not expect to find is that you can easily set it on its side and use several of the ToolBox utilities such as the Plumb Bob to take certain measurements such as seeing how leveled a desk or a table is. Not something I would typically use, but I can see other folks like those who work in constructions taking advantage of these tools. Speaking of the ToolBox apps, I like that there is several apps already installed that I can use while camping.

I don’t feel my daughter is old enough/mature enough for a phone. But I believe everyone should have access to music. We tried a mp3 player but it was annoying to put music on. And a really good mp3 player is hundreds of dollars. This was a cheap option and has parental controls. Unfortunately she can turn them off, luckily I would be notified. Proved it to her so she knows. It’s working great so far with Apple Music family plan. When she’s home she can download and look for new songs. On her walk to school or youth programs or doing chores or whatever she can easily listen to music. Slight issue with paring her head phones but that was a headphones issue. So all in all. I recommend if other parents are like me and looking for a easy cheaper way to get their kids music.I did have to make her a google account and then go into parent controls and link it to mine via her phone and then mine. And then downloaded an app on my phone(iPhone) to remotely control. Once I figured that out it was easy.Only small issue was setting her time to the right time zone. It lagged so I spent an hour trying to fix it. And then finally gave up but a few hours later it was magically on the right time zone.Happy with the purchase I got her a screen protector and an otterbox that came in the recommended add ons. Everything fits. So I recommend those products too.Oh and the apps and internet and everything else works well too without a SIM card when hooked only to WiFi. She get 30-1hr a day to surf the web bc she likes googling things. Animals, geology, astronomy, toys, when her shows and movies are going to release, her favorite characters to phone back grounds.She says the camera works really good and she already has a million pictures of our dogs. Next step is printing some.She also researched about the phone it’s self and how to do things. Like we can put in her thump print and mine to access the phone. I guess next she’s gonna research my iPhone to help me lolHer storage is filling up fast so we will be coming to that bridge when soon. Personally I think she needs to delete some photos and videos she made of her tv shows lol. But we have a lot of cloud storage through apple but idk yet how compatible that will be. I’m sure she will research it.Good buy for a WiFi only option! I’m thinking about getting one to keep in my purse for planning rather than my big planner that takes up so much space. And for music so I can not be interrupted during workouts. Bc I miss those days when people knew I was going to be unreachable and understood patience and not everything is an emergency lol. But we shall see. Lol', ""Of all the phones that I've owned, over past 25 years, this one is head-and-shoulders above all the rest!!Pros:1. BATTERY LIFE... Motorola advertises 2 days runtime on a full charge, but my experience has consistently been that I get over 7 days of normal use on a charge, and I usually recharge when I get below 30%.[User hint: I've actually found that I get *lower* discharge rate if I leave Wifi ON !!  I know it doesn't seem logical, but it is quite repeatable... with wifi off, the phone discharges at about 0.5%/hour (12%/day); with wifi ON, it is about 0.36%/hour (8.6%/day) ... That's the difference between 6 days and 8 days between charges.  I can't explain it, but it is definitely true! ]In the past, I focused on phones with removable batteries, so I could install larger after-market batteries to extend my run-time; the 10,000mAh battery in my LG V20 gave me about 9 days between charges, before that phone stopped working... that is comparable with what I get with the 5G's built-in 5000mAh battery.2. Pre-installed apps - this has been an on-going curse, especially with the miserable Samsung phones... My Moto G came with virtually *nothing* unwanted on it, and even the unwanted things that *were* installed (YouTube... and a couple others that I don't recall), I was actually permitted to uninstall, with no arguments!!  So there is no leftover garbage, pestering me to update... I am *ETERNALLY* grateful to Motorola for letting me remove what I don't want!!!3. voice reception is excellent... among the best that I've experienced, as good as any Samsung phone that I've used.4. Visuals (what the phone itself looks like) - not the most important issue, but the phone really *is* beautiful to look at!!  I've never actually cared about that with any previous phone.Cons:  [there really isn't much here]1. signal reception in remote locations... it is not quite as good at picking up weak signals as my Galaxy S5 was, but most other phones weren't superb with that either... it was one reason that I hung onto the S5 as long as I did... when I'm hiking in Sunol R.W. (Cal.), 10 miles outside the city, I rarely can pick up a signal, even from mountain tops... that's a bit disappointing, but as I said, typical of many other phones/services.  I was hoping the 5G phone would be more sensitive.2. screen resolution: 1080x2400 is rather low-end for a modern phone, but truth is, the phone looks great; even tiny text is readable, and icons are quite clear, so it's not that important to me..."", ""Great phone. 2nd time buying it. 1st time I paid AT&T $299.00 I believe it was on it actually costing $399.00 so it was a discount of a hundred off. It got lost and locking it under Google's find my device and reporting it to the police department didn't bring it back to me so I wound up on Amazon paying $200.00 for an unlocked to any carrier straight Motorola on the box same cosmic emerald even though somehow a slightly older version. The case and screen shield just like the 1st one had it in perfect condition. After two months of usage it goes missing again.  I don't believe a warranty came with it from Amazon and just like the 1st one from AT&T the Google find my device features just aren't helping to return my device to me.  I had to resort to using my old busted up lg Stylo 4 until I could find a $30 device at Family Dollar and you know, they actually all just do the same exact thing.  Hold files and business records only I really needed the ones that I put hundreds on to be able to actually be permanently of my business property and not be for anyone else but the business owner who purchased them for those hundreds. 32 GB of storage on a $30 device is doing just as fine as the 128 that cost me those hundreds on two prior Motorola 5g stylus emeralds. If the $30 device goes missing since not using a sim card or carrier then that's just $30. They are computers that I paid for and cannot get back. A home office for anywhere."", 'I went out a limb and bought Motorola G stylus 5 g phone.  This is my 1st android  it was as advertised unlocked and ready to be activated.  It was tricky transferring data from my iPhone  Just takes a little time and patience.  I’m not real tech savvy person.  The phone was in excellent condition.  Not a scratch on it.  Honestly it looked brand new.  Came with the stylus pen charger cable and wall plug.  I waited a few weeks before I wrote this to see if any issues popped up. None!!  For $150 and I purchased the 2 yr insurance plan for it so $187 out the door. This was a steal.  Maybe I got lucky with this phone with the condition it came in but this is worth every penny!!  This vendor had the phone at  my door in 3 days.  Great product and service !', 'I got this phone as a ""work phone"" since I didn\'t want the company apps on my iphone 11 pro max.I must say it\'s been a great phone.-Battery life is great.-Screen is big and has decent quality.-headphone jack is amazing-decent power for such a well priced phone-screen has very good reaction to input.-decent speeds-no issues with network connection.. infact I get better service with this than the iphone SE I was using before.There are some cons.. I mean it\'s a phone under $200 what did you expect?-Camera isn\'t great, but it works for what I use it for.-Screen under direct sunlight can be challenging to see, but not impossible.-idk if it\'s a Motorola thing but you can\'t control all the volumes with the side buttons.. you have to manually adjust texts, calls, and alarms separately. the volume button only adjust media sound levels like a video you are watching or a games volume. But you have a quick access button to this menu when you click the side buttons.-Although there is minimum bloat ware. The Motorola apps can be abrasive..you are going to have to adjust some setting.-single speaker is a big buzz kill. But having the headphone jack makes up for it.- not being water resistant you are going to want a case and screen protector which isn\'t all bad because the cases and screen protectors are dirt cheap.Does everything I need it to do with out issue.If you are looking for a cheap phone with decent power, and tired of Samsung and apples BS. I highly recommend taking a shot on this phone.', ""The phone itself is fine. Besides the newer Android that forces you to have Facebook, Tiktok, Snapchat and all that BS apps, the phone is quite fast and battery life should be phenomenal. From unboxing with 25% battery it lasts until the next day. But beware if you buy it for Visible. I ordered this phone for Visible and it was delivered on Aug 24, 2023. IMEI checker said it will work with Visible. And the phone works for usual browsing, phoning etc. EXCEPT Hotspot, Tethering and Wifi Calling. It took me multiple chat sessions, factory resets, network resets, facebook chat, chat again then back to facebook chat and on Aug 26th, after 4 days wasting my time, Visible finally sent me email saying 'the phone no longer compatible with their network'. Suddenly Visible IMEI checker says the IMEI is incompatible with our network. That is how sneaky they are."", ""Battery life A+++ outstanding, I am not a tech guy, so I won't speak to the bells and whistles. Everything I need it to do it does well. Also the stylus, I love it. cell phone keypads are not designed for human fingers! I find myself using the stylus for everything on the phone. It is a big phone, which is good if you are like me and your eyesight is not that great. My only gripe is the fingerprint reader, it works fine but I don't care for the placement on the back of the phone. It just makes it hard to put your finger in the right spot, without a few tries. Anyway I would recomend."", ""This may be a two-year old model, but it performs well. I can't compare it to a flagship phone, as I never used one. I can compare it to my Moto G7 that was 4G only. The difference in speed is definitely a pleasure. Set up was a breeze. I simply told Google to set it up the same as my now-waterlogged G7. Within minutes, all my apps and settings were done. I had the option to tether it to my old phone for an even easier setup; however, since the older phone was toast, that was no longer an option. Battery life is in a whole different league compared to what I had. I will easily get two days from a charge vs. almost one. I found only a couple instances of bloatware that I was able to remove without hassle. I remain a happy Moto user."", ""Wonderful battery life. It's a great little phone; unless you're a power user or something this phone is solid and tough with a nice screen and decent camera. Obviously higher grade cameras aren't going to be in the cards at this price but almost all the functions of this phone are solid. The stylus is shockingly good and pressure sensitive. I sometimes make little pixel art with it when I'm bored. The processor is good and while it's full of stupid bloatware, what can you do?"", 'First of all I am a ""retired"" telecom engineer + I owned one of the original Moto StarTech filp phone. It helped that I was working for them at the time.. now 20+ years later I am looking for a nice android phone because I need service in Central America and the locked up iPhone is not making the grade.. So I looked and felt this would do the trick. Oh yes it has BLOAT from Moto, some I can remove, some not.. That said I have had it in Roam mode for days, and guess what; it works great on wifi calls and text AND the battery will go for 4 days before I charge it at 25%. Yes I wish I could trim out the BLOAT but that is so far the only down side to this phone.']"

I was going through my amazon account and leaving some reviews on other items to try to help the community when I realized I had not updated this review as promised.  So here it is:It seem to be a very solid phone hardware and software wise. I even loved the feel of it. I only had it for a week or two before returning it cause of the lack of 5g.  I could not justify spending over 500 on a phone at the time that one of the main reason it cost almost 300 more then other models made by the same company was it was suppose to be 5g capable. It is 5g capable but not 5g friendly in the US.  Recommended for T-Mobile in the US.  But lacks one of two major bands making useful in the US needs bands N41 and N71.  No N71.. AGM customer service amazing as usually help me figure out the issue, then set me up with discount on the new h5 pro and desktop charger for it.  as a curtsy due to the way the phone was orginally advertised.Need to know what 5g bands Tmobile runs on in the US see below See below about T-mobiles 5g bands:Extended Range (XR) 5G  Frequencies that can provide XR 5G:  Band n71 (600 MHz)Ultra Capacity (UC) 5G  Frequencies that can provide UC 5G:  Band n41 (2.5 GHz)  Band n258 (24 GHz)  Band n260 (39 GHz)  Band n261 (28 GHz)Original Review:So I have owned 3 agm cell phones as of now..the h3 simply put was bad.. multiple software issues, multiple hardware and cosmetic challenges. Great customer service through agms Amazon team... Offered me a chance to try the h5 at a discount cause of this issue I had with the h3 after even after i had the h3 for three to 4 months. I Tried the h5. Allot more solid, very little software challenges, good hardware it seemed. Then after a few more months the microphone went dead.. suddenly with no apparent reason. There appeared to be no physical damage... Checked settings, uninstalled apps, factory reset phone nothing... Mic longer worked.. because I really wanted to love this company, though I am now feeling like I am idiot for doing so, I spent a little over 500 after tax on the glory... When I first booted the phone I was just awe struck.. software seemed to run flawlessly, love the torches on top, loud speaker sounded great... But then came the kicker... No 5g data... Now when I say no 5g I am exclusively talking about data... 5g appears to connect and work for voice... I took it to a T Mobile store... They tried several new sims no 5g data... They did say that there was 1 one or two bands that T Mobile had that the phone would not pick up but I was told that should not prevent me from accessing 5g in my area... I will update as I try to troubleshoot this issue further...']"

I upgraded from a Galaxy S20, so some of my comments will include that comparison.Pros:-MicroSD support! This is a requirement for me, and why I didn\'t really consider the S21 or S22.-Headphone jack! I missed it on the S20.-Replaceable battery! I hadn\'t had that since the LG G3.-Notification LED! I can\'t say I was conscious of missing it, and wasn\'t sure I\'d use it. But it\'s nice to be able to see charge status or if I have a new notification from across the room.-Rugged, grippy build, with IP68. I actually like the plastic; I don\'t get the trend of slippery, fingerprint-magnet glass sandwiches (like the S20).-Very fast and reliable side-mounted fingerprint sensor. I hate the trend of in-display fingerprint sensors that are slow, unreliable, and leave a smudge on the screen. (The S20 is horrible about this.)-Gorilla Glass Victus+ for the display. It also has an excellent oleophobic coating - doesn\'t easily get smeared.-Snappy, smooth performance with the efficient Snapdragon 778G. Gets warm occasionally but not hot and doesn\'t throttle. I don\'t notice a performance difference compared to a flagship (but then I don\'t do benchmarks or heavy gaming). (The S20 got really hot and throttled.)-USB 3 with video out and Samsung Dex support. USB video out often isn\'t listed on specs sheets, but it\'s usually only on flagships, so it\'s nice to have it here.-Great battery life. I can easily get 2+ days despite the not-huge battery (4050 mAh).-The Wifi and LTE range and speed are noticeably better than on my S20! (My rural Verizon-partner carrier does not have 5G so I can\'t comment on that.)-Extra assignable keys-Reasonable price-Software support equivalent to flagships (month security updates,, 4 Android updates, 5 years of security updates)-Clear, sharp display without PWM according to notebookcheck - PWM is a dimming method that uses flicker. OLEDs and some LCDs use it - this doesn\'t - no flicker! So it\'s easier on the eyes than OLED if you\'re flicker-sensitive. I find it to be bright enough.Cons:-It is a rather big and heavy phone. Think S22 Ultra with a rugged case.-The display is LCD, not AMOLED, and according to notebookcheck, the color accuracy isn\'t great. I admit that the colors aren\'t as vibrant as AMOLED - they don\'t ""pop"" as much. But I like the display anyway, and as noted above, it\'s sharp and clear and without PWM.-Being LCD, there\'s also no Always-On Display. I adjusted by turning on Lift to Wake, plus the notification LED and really fast fingerprint sensor help.-It has a notch for the front camera. It\'s a small waterdrop notch, but it\'s still my first phone with a notch and I don\'t love it. With the big bezels Samsung could have put the camera in the bezel instead.-Big bezels (but I don\'t care).-According the specs the cameras aren\'t as good as on a flagship. But they\'re good enough for me.-Slow charging. 15W ""Fast Charging"" was fast 5 years ago with much smaller batteries. At least battery life is good, and charging doesn\'t make the phone hot, and the battery is changeable.-The built-in mono audio is okay, but certainly not premium. Still, I can hear and be heard clearly and the volume is fine. The S20 certainly has better audio. But my friend said he could hear me better when I was on the XCover6 than on the S20, so maybe it has a better mic. Or maybe it was the better Wifi performance.Other notes:This model - SM-G736U1, USA Unlocked - is not identical to the European models reviewed on notebookcheck and YouTube, or the specs listed on GSMArena. The network bands supported are different. Also, some reviewed models have dual SIM slots plus dedicated MicroSD. This model does not. It has one SIM slot, one MicroSD slot, and supports e-SIM.-It\'s hard to find a network bands list for the USA Unlocked model. I can confirm that it supports LTE Band 13, required for Verizon and Verizon partner support. I had to check this because a lot of Samsung Unlocked devices - like the A53 - do not support Band 13. My rural Verizon partner requires B13 and it works great. No 5G is available in my area so I don\'t know what it supports there.That\'s a lot, hope it\'s helpful. Though I wish it had faster charging, I\'m very happy with this phone.', ""Battery life is acceptable to me, though quite a bit worse than my s8 was when new, or my Google pixels. However - the battery can be swapped in seconds! The screen is vibrant and large, and at least as good as my pixel 5a was while being larger. The sound quality is good, and the speakers are loud enough to hear videos while cooking in a private kitchen.I'd buy it again, but its not built like a tank - I don't expect it to survive big falls without a case or any significant water exposure regardless of what the certification says."", 'A great phone that has a removable battery, SD card slot, and a headphone jack.  I wish more phones had these features.', ""I FINALLY had to replace my LGV20 & it certainly wasn't an easy feat finding one as competent. Thank goodness for this one because it not only matched up to it's competency, it surpassed it in many aspects! First off, all phones should have a replaceable battery (an easily replaceable battery I suppose I should say). Due to my last phone having one I was able to hold on to it for many years longer than my friends and family held on to theirs without one, so that was a must have. Secondly, it's a newer phone but still sports an external jack, another must have! It's lightning fast compared to my LG (but to be fair to my old LG, it Was old and pretty much maxed out on RAM), and it's fully customizable, which is always nice, and the battery charges super fast and so far, lasts super long! The speakers are loud and great too! My only critics are that it's rather large (even longer than my LG) & the fingerprint sensor isn't as friendly as my LG's was... but if you're looking for a capable android that will last a long time and won't break your wallet, I'd say this is the phone!"", 'Fancy engineer-class business phone, expesive for its specs, but able to stand up to harsh field conditions, I was pretty excited to get this.""Standard Limited Warranty does not cover: damage caused by exposure to liquid, moisture, dampness, weather conditions, sand, dust, or dirt that is inconsistent with the specifications and instructions applicable to the Product according to the user manual and the applicable terms and conditions""So I look up the applicable specifications and instructions:""How do I properly care for and use my Samsung device?Samsung devices may be damaged if water or dust enters the device. For devices with an IP68 rating, follow these tips to prevent damage to your device and to help maintain the water and dust resistant performance:Do not immerse the device in fresh water deeper than 1.5 metres and do not keep it submerged in fresh water less than 1.5 metres deep for more than 30 minutes.Do not expose the device to water moving with force.If the device is exposed to fresh water, dry it thoroughly with a clean, soft cloth.If the device is exposed to any liquid other than fresh water, gently rinse it with fresh water immediately and dry it thoroughly with a clean, soft cloth. Failure to gently rinse it in fresh water and dry it as instructed may cause it to suffer from operability or cosmetic issues.""No problem, it was never exposed to anything close to that. So my warranty is good right? Nope. The repair technicians apprently decide in each and every case that all water damage is uncovered despite what the warranty claims. And I was told water damage to the screen or motherboard would not be covered in any case; that doesn\'t count. They offered to fix for a fee, generously offering me a refurbished phone at the full price of a brand new phone. So needless to say, I\'m unhappy.', ""best phone i ever had, very happy with all the features, 120hz refresh rate, removable battery, supports esim, regular micro sim, sd card, has 128gb storage, 6gb ram, very good processor, very fast phone, battery life last forever, its waterproof, drop proof, has extra buttons on side and top you can program for anything for example the flashlight, so u dont even have to go into phone setting, just hit the button and on and off goes the flashlight, so many more great things the phone will do, plays games like pubg without draining battery or getting hot, o, and its also a 5g phone, has latest wifi/6 and a head phone jack, theres other features to i didn't list, anyways this phone has the most features ull find with a removable battery, if battery goes bad, order a new one, pop the cover off and change it, most phones are nearly impossible to get apart to change the battery now a days, this one couldn't be easier"", ""General overview during two months of ownership:I had this phone for less than two months.  I think it's a good enough smartphone.  I only use this smartphone for normal everyday use such as web browse, text message, and watch less than ten videos that are less than 15 minutes long per day.  The battery usually ends up at around 50% at the end of the day.  I only charge my phone to 85% and that is what I start with at the start of the day.Form factor:In regards to the form factor of the smartphone, I like the shape and it is super easy to handle compared to my old S20 Ultra 5G.  This fits so much easier in my pant pockets and jacket pockets.  I love that fact that I don't have to use a sim card ejector tool in order to install my sim card or microSD card because of the removeable back cover.  I love having removeable back cover.Camera:I love the fact that in normal camera mode the software makes the camera take super fast and in-focus pictures.  I think this is really convenience for people who want to take a quick photo and not have to change modes or have to deal with manual camera settings.  Easy to take a photo of items that I want to show to other people.Battery:Removeable!

This phone is the ultimate upgrade for anyone that is running an older flagship phone because it includes a removable 4000mah battery, a headphone jack, a 120hrz screen, 6Gb of LP-ddr4 running at 2133mhz (can you believe that?), and a Snapdragon 778G 5G processor that has on-par performance (and maybe even a little higher) to a Snapdragon 855+ that consumes less power for battery life. This phone is legit the ultimate upgrade for anyone who wants to use this as a daily phone for the next 6-7 years. Want to watch youtube while browsing the web or browsing Amazon? You got it. Want to play games while watching youtube? This thing doesn't even flinch with lag. This phone can also handle Citra games with 1x resolution without a problem! Now that's pretty crazy.The point is, my overall experience with this phone is amazing and I can recommend this phone for anyone who is upgrading from an old Android like myself. I have also noted that this phone takes the same batteries as the Xcover Pro from the previous generation so If you own an Xcpver Pro, the battery from the old one can still be used for a while before using the new one provided in the box."", ""Mixed results on this one - it seems like a dream phone, even bringing back features that I thought were gone forever.Unfortunately I ran into a show-stopper that Verizon says this device is not compatible with personal accounts and can only be activated/used on a line that is on an active business-class account.I did try a prepaid card on AT&T and T-Mobile and found it seems to work fine on their 4G LTE and 5G networks (not sure what was up with some saying it couldn't do AT&T 5G).  I saw it report AT&T LTE, LTE+, and 5G and ran speedtests and made calls fine.  Also saw T-Mobile LTE, LTE+, 5G, 5G UC and ran speedtests and made calls fine.Verizon I wasn't able to get it activated on a line due to Verizon refusing to activate it on a non-business account, but it did see my Network Extender on band 13.Seems really strange, but I'm going to have to return it as Verizon isn't allowing me to use it in spite of the phone saying it's compatible with Verizon.""]"

Porém, se essa vai ser sua principal forma de jogar o jogo, recomendo ir atrás de outro aparelho, como o POCO F3, que já testei eu mesmo e que sei que consegue rodar o jogo muito bem, ou então utilizar alternativas como Geforce Now.Porém, é claro que há uma diferença de mais de mil reais entre um F3 e um M5, e sendo honesto, pelo preço do M5, a performance que ele tem no Genshin já é de se esperar, e levando em conta que esses problemas de performance só se encontram em jogos pesados, eu acho perfeitamente justo e é um preço ótimo para um celular.Recomendo para alguém que esteja atrás de um aparelho que possa comprar e não se incomodar por muito tempo, porém, se você é do tipo que joga muitos jogos pesados, esse celular não é pra você.', 'Eu gostei do tempo de entrega, o produto em si e maravilhoso e a segurança no ato da compra', 'Eu amei demais e um ótimo celular pro seu preço sem dúvidas', 'Produto muito bom superou minhas expectativas, o smartphone é fácil de usar e o sistema é bem fluido.', 'Para um celular básico do dia dia, ótimo e custo benefício corresponde.', 'Es un teléfono excelente qué ofrece todas las opciones de configuración para satisfacer las necesidades de cualquier usuario, a pesar de qué no cuenta con una pantalla amoled, su pantalla lcd sé ve con excelente calidad de colores y definición.

‎PAV00072FR,Motorola Edge 30 Neo Dual-Sim 128GB ROM + 8GB RAM (GSM only | No CDMA) Factory Unlocked 5G SmartPhone (Very Peri) - International Version,Smartphones,S$509.97,https://www.amazon.sg/Motorola-Dual-Sim-Factory-Unlocked-SmartPhone/dp/B0BD466TVT/ref=sr_1_146?qid=1695968241&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051%2Cp_72%3A6469119051%2Cp_36%3A20000-150000&rnid=6450031051&s=electronics&sr=1-146,https://www.amazon.sg/Motorola-Dual-Sim-Factory-Unlocked-SmartPhone/product-reviews/B0BD466TVT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,4.0,"['Buen Edge 30 Neo. Es pequeñito, como un juguete, pero eso lo hace cómodo de usar porque los dedos llegan a prácticamente toda la pantalla y no te cansa las manos (o la mano, porque se puede manejar bastante bien con una sola).Se parece bastante en especificaciones al Motorola g82 (de hecho, ambos emplean el Snapdragon 695) pero el g82 es un poco más grande y más tosco de sostener.Resumo mis impresiones: - ✅ Compacto y muy ligero: 155 g. Incluso me gusta más sujetarlo con la funda que trae porque mejora mucho el agarre y apenas aumenta el peso. Eso sí, la funda podría haber sido de un material TPU más protector en vez de plástico rígido, aspecto a mejorar ❌ Compra una funda TPU transparente normal y conseguirás el mismo buen agarre pero con más protección. - ✅ 419 ppi: calidad de imagen magnífica. Se nota sobre todo cuando estás viendo fotos y vídeos (instagram, youtube...), más que cuando lees texto por la web, donde apenas hay diferencia. El g82 ofrece 402 ppi (a priori, casi igual) pero sus imágenes se ven menos definidas, las caras de las personas tienen un color menos rico... Si se presta atención, se nota la diferencia a favor del Neo y eso ocurre porque ofrece una pantalla de 10 bits y una gama de color DCI-P3 que consigue colores ricos y profundos. - ✅ Snapdragon 695. Podrían haber incluido un chip un poco mejor porque Edge es la gama alta de Motorola pero es suficiente y mejor que el 680, que tanto abunda. - ✅ Carga muy rápida con el cargador incluido de 68W: en 45 min está cargado al 100%, si bien tengo la duda de si usar ese cargador tan potente puede acortar la vida de la batería. - ✅ Carga inalámbrica de 5W. Puede ser un plus si tienes estación de carga inalámbrica y lo quieres dejar cargando cómodamente, aunque la carga será mucho más lenta (2 horas) que con el cable de 68W. - ✅ 4020 mAh. Una batería de 5000 mAh (como el g82) hubiera sido la guinda pero eso hubiera aumentado el peso del teléfono y con 4000 aguanta bastante bien la jornada. Cada 6 minutos suele bajar un 1%, por lo que aguanta unas 9 - 10 horas de uso continuo (depende también de cuántas apps usemos a la vez, si es vídeo o solo navegación, del brillo, etc). En cualquier caso, das una carga rápida con el cargador de 68W y en tres cuartos de hora vuelve a estar llena. - ✅ 120 Hz, si bien yo lo tengo a 60 para ahorrar batería. - ✅ Actualizará a Android 13 y 14. Motorola es lenta actualizando pero anunció que lo haría. El g82, en principio, se quedará en Android 13. - ✅ Altavoces dan muy buen sonido. - ✅ Con volumen alto apenas vibra por detrás. En el g82 se nota mucho más la vibración. - ✅ Ready For: app de Motorola para conectar el móvil a la tele o al ordenador. Un poco redundante pero también puede tener utilidad, como usar la cámara del Neo en videollamadas con el ordenador o visualizar cualquier app del móvil en el pc. - ✅ 8 GB RAM (por 6GB del g82). - ✅ 128 GB (igual que el g82). - ✅ Con un doble toque en la parte de atrás se puede hacer captura de pantalla, abrir una app concreta... Personalizas el doble toque a tu gusto eligiendo entre varias opciones. Hay que darle con la huella completa y a una cierta velocidad porque si no, falla. Funciona incluso con funda. Creo que es una característica exclusiva de la gama Edge. - ✅ USB C 3.1 (pasa archivos un pelín más rápido que USB C 3.0). - ❓La cámara, regular. No es mala pero tampoco hace maravillas. Prácticamente igual que la del g82. - ❌ No se puede meter una tarjeta SD para ampliar almacenamiento. En el g82 sí se puede. - ❌ Sin jack 3.5 para auriculares con cable, que sí trae el g82. Deberemos estar recargando auriculares inalámbricos o usar un adaptador usbc-jack.  - ❌ Sin radio FM, que sí trae el g82.  - ❌ La huella de desbloqueo (que está en la pantalla) va bastante bien pero, como no deja de ser un flash a tu dedo, emite mucha luz si no se coloca el dedo centrado. Esto pasa en todos los móviles con este tipo de huella y de noche, a oscuras, molesta. De día, no tanto porque se puede usar el desbloqueo por reconocimiento facial. El g82 coloca su huella en el botón lateral, no escandila y no falla, a diferencia de esta huella del Edge, que a veces (pocas) sí lo hace. - ❌ Las teclas de volumen tienen buen recorrido pero hay que hacer fuerza para pulsarlas y podrían ser más silenciosas.

A cada rato, una parte de la pantalla se queda congelada, mientras que la otra sigue funcionando con normalidad. ¿Solución rápida? Pulsas en ella y vuelve a verse bien instantáneamente. No es grave pero sí molesta un poco porque a lo mejor estás escribiendo un wasap y de repente la fila superior del móvil (donde aparecen los iconos de la hora, la batería...) te aparece de golpe en el medio de la pantalla o abajo, y te rompe la fluidez de tu escritura. La buena noticia: según he leído en foros, se soluciona cambiando la pantalla de forma gratuita con el servicio técnico de Motorola (usando la garantía de 2 años). Es, por tanto, un problema de hardware. No creo que ninguna actualización de software logre solucionarlo por arte de magia. La mala noticia: para enviarlo al servicio técnico, hay que borrar todo y te quedas un par de semanas sin él. Mal control de calidad de Motorola en este Edge 30 Neo.

Either I didn\'t do enough deep-dive research on this phone, or the hype that\'s been building with the Pixel brand of phones over the years has been fabricated. Either way... lesson learned.My issues with this phone have thus far been:1) No matter how much adjusting of the screen & display setting, the screen randomly-to-always responds to finger and/or other pressure sensing to cause the screen to light up. Even in my shirt pocket it will randomly ""activate"", and by the time I have pulled it out, the phone has various apps opened. For transparency, I\'m one who prefers to not have a screen lock, therefore I shouldn\'t have to have one set just to prevent what I just mentioned from happening. Screen lock is supposed to be for security reason... not because the device is glitchy and whatnot.2) More times than not, when I plug the phone up to a proper charging cable & adapter, or better, it will ding and screen light up every few seconds indicating it\'s charging like when it is first connected to the charger. Seems like it isn\'t charging correctly or there\'s a malfunction in the phone\'s circuitry. I have tried numerous chargers & cables... same thing. But it isn\'t every single time... just most of the time.3) Many times when I am ready to close an app, I have to tap on the bottom screen controls numerous times until it finally responds and does what it\'s supposed to do. And I do not use a screen protecting cover... just a case enclosure to protect the body and to keep the phone feeling like a wet bar of soap slipping from my hand when holding it.4) Installing the monthly security updates takes freaking forever! A 40MB - 500MB update should not take very long to install on a current model flagship spec\'d phone. It takes so long that the screen timeout feature set to longest possible of 30-minutes (which is absurd that one can\'t have the option to choose longer like the good ole days). Once the screen times out, the update is paused until you turn the screen back on, which in turn causes the update process to assume you\'re using your phone and states that the update can\'t proceed while the phone is in use. You\'d think telling the update process to resume would just pick up where it left off and maybe hopefully finish, right?... Nope! It starts all over again! The only way I can get the monthly update to install is to stay in front of my phone to keep an eye on it and to press the Volume up or down button every so often to prevent the screen from timing out and to not accidentally ""use"" my phone by tapping on the screen or whatever else. It generally takes 1-2 hours to install the update, which is ridiculous! The download part happens smooth & quick, so it\'s not a Wi-Fi or using cellular connection scenario... it\'s the installation part.EDIT to #4... God forbid any app on your phone throws up just a simple notification at the top. For instance, today April 10th 2023 while trying to get the 40.97 MB monthly update to install, after an hour went by and it was (is) still installing, my Amazon app had a notification come through, without popping up over the update process mind you... just the icon in the upper left corner, the daggum install process ""paused"" claiming it can\'t process the update while the phone is in use. WHAT?!?! So tell me, Google... are your customers expected to have to turn off any & all app background operations, disable all possible notifications/reminders/alerts/etc., text everyone we know to not to attempt to contact you in any way prior to trying to install a month 40 MEGABYTE file that takes 1-2 hours to install?... and every month at that?5) Bluetooth connectivity... over the past month or so, the Bluetooth will be a 50/50 if it\'ll connect to any of my Bluetooth devices when it never had a problem before. Even removing & repairing the devices doesn\'t fix it. I have to try & try many times most of the time now for the phone to connect and stay connected to the devices. Even power cycling the phone (rebooting) doesn\'t help.6) Also, over the past couple of months I have noticed that when I video call with someone, it has been getting worse on the battery during those times. What I mean is, when plugging the phone in to recharge while still using the phone. It used to recharge, albeit slowly, while I would be videoing with another, but now it will either just remain at the battery level its at when plugging it in, or even still drop a % or two. Even my older phones still re-charge while in video call use. Understandable that the re-charge would be slower due to device usage of video calling, but now being stagnate or even still discharging?7) And now, the phone has begun to overheat rapidly when using the phone since the March 2023 security Update. More so when video calling to the point where the phone cuts off... even with the case removed. It\'ll be so hot I can\'t even hold the phone until it cools off. I have ruled out the Messenger & Skype apps being the issue since I have other Android phones with the latest app version updates of those, and no battery re-charge drain or overheating issues with those. But it\'ll also overheat when using other non-video or intense processing apps too in a short amount of time when it never did before. And I always clear out background running apps when I\'m done using them every time... so that\'s not the issue either.What makes this even more astonishingly absurd to me is, Android is a Google OS software and the Pixel line of phones are a Google hardware product... but yet the Android driven Pixel phones are the ones who seem to be arguably suffering the worst in many critical areas. It\'s almost as if they want to punish customers who chose to pay them money instead of going to a competitor. I\'m beginning to think Google is now being ran & operated by BARD.The rest of my complaints are more or less personal nit-picks like... can\'t remove the date & weather nor the Google search at the bottom from the home screen, can\'t increase the screen timeout time longer than 30-minutes, no LED indicator when the screen is off if there are new notifications or if the battery is done charging, random out of the blue phone restarts for no rhyme or reason even when there is no updates... to name a few.Sadly, I can\'t return this purchase given that it\'s been over 30-days, and Google support is of no help either. So much for having a warranty when they won\'t honor it. I highly recommend staying away from Pixel phones.', ""Disclaimer: This review is still very fresh as I have only had the phone for a day.  I am also coming from a Samsung device.  A Z Fold 4 to be exact.  Why did I go from a one year old future of phone tech to a standard black rectangle?  Well because not even a year into ownership the phone died, and Samsung's support is not great.  So here is my slightly biased, maybe rose colored glasses review.I am really loving this phone.  Setup was your typical Android affair.  I am glad that I did not need Samsung's proprietary data transfer software that every other Samsung device needs.  All accounts synced as they are supposed to thanks to Google.  App locations and menu items are slightly different from OneUI but did not take long to adjust.  What surprised me is just how much better my apps seem to run on this device.  For some, unspecific apps I use for security they would mostly work, but pulling up video or network intensive portions would either be a slog or just not work at all.  This happened on three generations of Samsung devices so I thought it was just poor programming.  Now I just think it was bloat.  On performance alone this is a full on winner and it will take Samsung some actual innovation to get me to come back.I did like aspects of the folding screen on my previous phone and I still see it as the future of phone tech.  I think what I really wanted is a phone with this screen size and aspect ration that then folds to a bigger screen.  Not something that is super skinny that folds out to a ratio that no one knows what to do with yet.It's hard to judge the battery life after just one day, but so far it's nice.Overall, if you are not sold on foldables, and you are tired to dealing with Samsung bloat, poor batteries, and customer waitus, this is a great option."", 'UQ モバイル契約には、この高級機種は\u3000UQ\u3000店舗では取り扱ってくれません、のでアマゾンで買いました。SIM\u3000差し替えだけで正常にキョーセラ\u3000BASIO4から乗り換え出来ました。', 'Previously used an iPhone. Could not justify the EXTREME price of a new iPhone. If you love your Samsung phone, well good for you. I hate them. Maybe a true believer will always pay too much for a phone, but the Pixel is a better value right now. I bought the Pixel also for the Camera, which I believe is currently the best available. (YMMV) Battery life is great so far. Display is very nice, and fast, but not something I can go, ""Ooh Wow"" about. Display just works. I have heard I can actually increase the resolution in settings, but it is OK as it is. This is the biggest, and possibly the heaviest, phone I ever owned. I wanted a big phone to make typing easier, and it works. If you check out the video reviews, you can see that real time voice recognition works flawlessly. I could probably do everything by voice command, almost exclusively, but so far, I am not really into that. Voice mails transcribe to text perfectly. Taking videos, works better than anything I have used before. I guess I only have one complaint: Compared to iOS, Android is a crude joke. With very rare exceptions iOS just works, intuitively. iOS is a polished piece of work. Android is getting better, but you would think by the time it got to version 13, it would also be a work of art. Perhaps there are too many fingers in the Android pie. Apps are generally adequate in selection, and function. As for Gmail App, I hated it years ago, and it has not gotten any better that I can see. Still will not search (has it, never works), still will not quickly and easily do bulk erasures. still has few sorting functions. As for all of the swipe gestures; they are abused. Put some convenient buttons on the screen as well, or instead. My favorite Android fault (that has never been totally addressed) is the craziest of all. Answering an incoming phone call. It is a PHONE people. Yes there may be 15 different ways to answer an incoming call, and that is the problem. The answer button can pop up several different places on the screen, or not pop up at all. I thought I was nuts, because sometimes it seemed like a call would come in, with NO WAY to answer it. I figured, ""Well idiot, you just need to take a 400 level course at some prestigious University to learn how to use your phone correctly."" So I asked both friends, and a few strangers, ""Do you ever get an incoming call on your Android phone, and have no way to answer the call?"" Strangely, THEY ALL SAID YES.This is however, a phone review, so yes, great phone. This is probably the the best value in top end Flagship phones. Consider the price, the features, the reliability, the durability, and customer support. You can pay more, but probably won\'t get much more. Exception may be if you want a folding phone, but really, what is that actually worth?  If you can stomach paying what they want for the Flagship iOS phone from Apple, those are really nice too. As for smartphone privacy, I can\'t stop laughing. The best thing about our smartphones collecting every detail possible about our location, movements, associations, heart rate, hours of sleep, automobile acceleration, searches, and conversations by and around us, is this: Because they can do it, I was not subjected to the humiliation of having a chip implanted into my body against my will. You know, just like they did with the SARS-CoV-2 (2019) mRNA vaccine. The fingerprint reader works for about one or two days, then you have to erase, and re-save, your finger print. I think that is because I actually use my hands for manual tasks, so the lines and cracks move about. Had exactly the same problem with my iPhone, but it was 6 years old. I was hoping for better on a new premium phone.', ""Bought this phone about 9 months ago, and it has so far been satisfactory. Here are some of the Pros and Cons:PROs:- The cameras take very good photos, excellent for scanning documents and taking selfies, the camera's software is also great for editing.- The screen is fairly bright, so it works well outdoors.- Good performance on applications, can quickly switch between them, it's rare for them to crash or to have glitches.- Fingerprint recognition and face recognition both work very fast., rarely a problem with that.- I love the phone's UI, feels much cleaner than any other Android phone I've seen or used.CONs:- The battery life is just acceptable, but it can drain quickly when under load. Expect 6-7 hours of active screen time, but it should last up to 36 hours for a moderate or light user.- Charging is kinda slow, up to 1 hour 50 minutes if you're close to 0%. Definitely way slower than my old OnePlus 6T.- You should definitely buy a screen protector and case. It never had a particularly bad drop, but the screen already has a small scuff mark from just being in my pocket (admittedly often with keys).- If you live in a country like mine (Bolivia), depending on your service provider, the first time you use it you might have to manually enter the APN settings. My provider's settings were automatically detected but the 4G service had horrible signal everywhere in the city, but then I googled the provider's APN settings, entered them manually, and I've had great LTE connectivity ever since."", ""One of the best smartphone camera systems on the market. Phone is fast and responsive. Has a bunch of features exclusive to Pixel phones. But there are a couple downfalls that prevent it from being perfect.Not much to say about the cameras except that they are awesome. Everyone already knows Pixels have some of the best cameras. I do like the automatic edits once you take a picture (it'll try to make the colors look natural). I've had several instances where it improved the look of the sky that was behind me. It's really great for landscape shots and has several modes for picture taking and video recording. Cameras are nice in low light. Nightscape mode will enhance the picture taken so that you get a clear picture.User experience has been really nice due to the clean android experience. I switched from the OnePlus 6T and everything still felt very intuitive. I did miss the notification bar but it was really easy to get used to Android 12. There are a lot of built in features with the Pixel that make it unique. Call filtering allows it to automatically screen calls. Direct my call converts speech to text and provides options when calling vendors/support. Hold for me detects hold music and waits on hold for you until someone is ready to speak. Phone also includes free access to Google VPN. There are a plethora of other features, but those are some that I found really handy.Battery life is not as terrible as some people have said. However, it's not great either. It feels standard to me. I will still need to charge at the end of each day. It's certainly not a 24 hour battery if you use your phone regularly. Charging speed is slow. There's no hiding it. You can turn off the adaptive charging, but it still takes too long to charge. OnePlus has some of the best charging speeds, but other phones have also been able to up their charging speeds as well. As a 2022 phone, I would've expected this to charge much faster.I've noticed some occasional strange performance issues that seem to stem from this phone. There have been multiple instances where the phone wouldn't connect to my car via usb. I would need to restart the phone to get it to work. Video recording will stop and not let you record if the temperature outside is too high. I've never had warning on any other phone. I've had an issue where I hear no audio on a phone call, but other party can hear my voice. This was fixed by restarting the phone. Some customers reported that the camera bump can easily get scratched. I have a pretty thick case so I haven't had any scratches. You can also get a skin to cover it.Price is higher than what you pay for. Sure it's cheaper than Samsung Galaxy. However, it also lacks a lot of the raw power Samsung has. You're mainly paying for the camera and the features you can only find on a Pixel device. Other than that, the specs aren't anything that you don't see in a phone nowadays. If I had not purchased this, I would've gone for the OnePlus 11 as it's at a much cheaper price point and has most of the things I want.Overall, happy with the phone. It's a nice upgrade from my old phone. I'm not looking for the cutting edge in terms of hardware because I don't primarily use this for gaming. I appreciate the Pixel exclusive features that actually add to the experience of using this phone. I just wish that some of those bugs get resolved."", ""I'm giving it 4 stars because the camera has an automatic filter that cannot be disabled, which forces you to install a different camera app. Additionally, I was considering returning the phone due to its poor battery life, but I found an option that reduces battery consumption, and I haven't noticed any difference since then. Lastly, the heat protector could be a good feature, but I don't understand why the sun triggers airplane mode because of it when I'm driving; it seems a bit excessive. I'll keep the phone despite these issues. Other than that, the phone is good, but I expected better from a Google Pixel."", 'El mobil esta muy bien, creo el diseño es agrarable y cumple con todas las espectativas.Una muy buena opcion si quieres un telefono con buenas especificaciones y que tome buenas fotos.Puntos a considerar:-La camara es muy buena, pero el video no es el mejor, sin embargo no esta mal.-La bateria es parecida a la del iphone en cuanto a duracion y carga, si quieres un mobil que cargue rapido y dure mucho tiempo su bateria busca otro. En promedio me dura 14+ horas dependiendo de como lo uses, y se carga en 1 hora30 min a 2 hrs (si no usas el telefono o lo apagas mientras carga)-Solo trae el cable, no cargador, comprar un cargador de 30 w, recomendado el UGREEN.-La memoria no se expanded pero te regalan al menos 1 mes de google one que te ofrece 100 gb de almacenamiento en la nube, y otras cosas. Y el costo si quieres continuar tu suscripcion es muy barato.Muy importante: La bateria se calienta cuando usas por primera vez el mobil, es importante descargues la ultima actualizacion para evitar esto. Habia escuchado sobre este tema y pense que seria algo constante pero despues de la actualizacion funciona bien, puedr ser que forzando el telefono pase de nuevo (p.e. jugando juegos muy demandantes), pero al menos a mi no me pasa. Si el mobil se Sigue calentando mucho es recomendad no tener muchas aplicaciones abiertas, quitar la funda cuando lo cargues evitar el uso prolongado de aplicaciones duales, hay una losta de estas recomendaciones en internet, sugiero buscarla.Por ultimo, hay una funcionalidad que solo esta activa para estados unidos y Europa, pero esto es normal ya que El telefono aun no se vende oficialmente en otras partes.En general, muy feliz con el producto, ampliamemte recomendado. Si lo encuentras en oferta recomiendo comprarlo, aunque en octubre se lanza la nueva version.']"

Its ease of use, great camera quality and 4K video recording on BOTH front and rear cameras, as well as the Live Action Wallpaper and 120 Hz screen, is just the beginning of what these phones can do.I went with this model because, like I said before, I do have the latest Apple iPhone and paying for a higher-end Galaxy phone is out of my reach now. (This Galaxy Model is about $450.)Bottom line, I am KEEPING both my iPhone AND this Galaxy A53 5G, at least until I can get the one I’d really want, and that’s the Samsung Galaxy s23 Plus in Phantom Black.

The no bloatware is great. The battery life is great. The camera is good. It has a 3.5mm jack. The screen isn't an OLED, but that really doesn't matter at this price point.The issue with this phone is the memory and storage are now insufficient for Android. Android uses half the memory of the phone, and with other resource intensive applications this quickly uses up the available memory. It's not so much Nokia's fault but Google's for their poor and inefficient coding. Most of that is to intrude on the user's privacy. I am tempted to install a Linux distro to get around this glaring issue, but its disruptive to switch OS."", 'I decided to go with an unlocked Nokia G400 5G because of a great experience I had with my previous Nokia smartphone (which was a Nokia 7.1, and was getting a bit outdated), but unfortunately, I have been disappointed with the G400 5G. Just to note, I have been using the phone for a little over a month now and run it on the Verizon network.First the good. The battery life is great and the 20W fast charging gets the phone juiced up quickly. The camera is decent for the device\'s price. I love that it includes a headphone jack (as I listen to a lot of music for long hours at my work desk and prefer to use wired headphones in that situation vs wireless ones; but the Bluetooth works well too when I use wireless headphones during exercise). I also love the built-in FM radio, as I can switch over to local music stations when I don\'t want to be using data to stream music.Now for the bad. It runs Android 12, a version with lots of complaints from many users. My number one complaint is that Google removed the ""vibrate mode icon"" from the status bar of this Android version. This means it is very easy to turn vibrate mode on and forget the setting is active. Google added a setting to restore the icon in the status bar in Android 13, so I am hoping Nokia eventually provides an Android 13 OS update for the G400 5G.Besides that issue, the software is just plain buggy. It is very slow to open simple apps, like Google Messages sometimes. My music streaming app often kills over (even with battery optimization turned off for said app) and that same app\'s audio stutters when locking and unlocking the phone. But, by far the most frustrating software issue for me is related to adaptive brightness. When I first started using the phone, it was extremely frustrating to watch the screen brightness go up and down constantly, even without any change in the surrounding light conditions. I literally could sit in a dark room and watch the screen increase in brightness, then drop down, then go back up, and drop back down again (all without any change to what the screen was displaying or the room’s darkness). I reset the adaptive brightness settings, but the same issue continued. After about two weeks the problem calmed down some, but it is still happening to a degree, especially in low light situations. It also happens more often in certain apps, which is why I am sure it is a software issue. I am hopeful that if Nokia updates this phone to Android 13, some of these software issues may be resolved and will update my review if that happens.UPDATE (Summer 2023): Nokia released a software update in March that caused the camera app to stop working and their next update in July didn\'t fix it. Just bought a new phone from a different brand. So disappointed in Nokia.', 'Got this phone to replace a Motorola One Action.  THE key feature I needed was solid connectivity.  My old phone tended to drop the data connection in some areas - these issues have been completely resolved with Nokia.  Battery life is great, also much better than the motorola - even after a day of heavy use there\'s still plenty of charge left.  I don\'t recall having less than 30%Also, since it is an unlocked phone, there\'s virtually no bloatware pre-installed.Camera is decent - I\'d say up to par with the Motorola Action One if not better.  I use it for videos of my classes as well as snapshots and it handles all lighting conditions well.The only reason I\'m giving it only 4 out of 5 stars is that Nokia elected to put the google assistant permanently on the main screen - I believe a change of launcher will be in order in the foreseeable future.One additional note;  I\'m using the phone on the T-mobile network.  No issues here.  Interesting fact T-mobile sells their branded/locked phone about cheaper than this one.  However, they will charge you an ""Upgrade Fee"" that is roughly the same amount as their lower price.  When I asked them what the service was that this fee supposedly covered, they could not provide a concise answer.Bottom line:  This unlocked version comes to the same price as the T-mobile branded/locked phone and you have less pre-installed ""Stuff"" on it - definitely recommend this one!Update:  lost the software connection to the front facing camera about nine months into using this phone. Thankfully still covered under warranty, but I got to remove all sensitive data and ship it to Nokia to fix.  Currently struggling to find a temporary replacement.  As good as the phone is otherwise, this is a major flaw and apparently a common problem with Nokia', ""The phone is nice for calling and web browsing but haven't been able to get any texts from anyone no matter what I have tried. They worked for first couple days than nothing. I'm not really a text message person but many of my family who live farther off won't communicate other ways so they're kind of important for contact with them.Nokia wasn't any help when contacted about the issue even though it honestly seems like a manufacturer issue instead of phone carrier issue as I had been told because I never had this trouble with other phone before Nokia. I really wish they still cared about making quality products like they used to about 30 years ago. I don't think I will ever give Nokia another try after this even if they offered me a phone free.As another reviewer mentioned as well I have noticed that the screen brightness doesn't stay either up or down it's constantly dropping or increasing."", 'One of the better phones you can find under $300, and is probably all many people need.  Good battery life, nice screen, reasonably fast, and good camera for the price.  No issues using social media, web browsing, and light game playing.  The phone also works well as an actual phone with decent sound quality.  I compared this Nokia G400 5G camera in multiple lighting conditions to a Motorola G Stylus 5G (2021),  and the Nokia had a better picture in every case.  For a phone at this price it has a good camera.  I also compared the camera to a Pixel 7a (which cost more than double) and the Pixel 7a had a better picture in every case (as expected).  So is it the best phone on the market - no, but it is a good phone for under $300.  An excellent value when on sale for under $200.', 'I\'ve used this phone for just about 3 months now, and have made a few tweaks...The google camera app started acting stupid, and not working, but when I replaced it with a 3rd party camera app, it works great again.I also didn\'t like the google assistant stuff, always in the way, so I use Nova Launcher, to completely change the ""desktop"" to my liking. I don\'t use google assistant, and it no longer is displayed anywhere.I\'ve had problems with step counter apps, either not starting, or stopping randomly, but I believe this is a google/android ""feature"" that kills background apps... I did find a very small and ""simple step counter"" app that seems to work most of the time now.It\'s probably not as fast as phones that cost 5 times more, but for the price, it packs a lot of value.', 'This replaced an old G3 network phone that finally died [just used for wi-fi streaming at home].

It is large, heavy, well protected, and gives the feeling of durability.The H5 Pro's unique and outstanding features are, being ruggedized, loudspeaker, 7000 mah batter, and night vision camera.The phone comes with a USB C to USB A cable plus wall charger.  This phone also has the ability to charge via charging dock accessory (sold separately).  Just keep in mind, it is an alternative to having wireless charging but is not the same as wireless charging because it relies on the proprietary charging dock (very similar to old cordless phones).The things I don't like about this phone are the weight, the volume and power button being too close, and the lack of 5G.I can forgive the lack of 5G because of the price point and all the other added features.The heaviness or weight of the phone - that's really a personal preference.  The power and volume button being too close...that I think deserves a small ding in the rating, although I am not taking a star away from it because I think it is a minor nitpick.As advertised this is a rugged phone and recommended if you have a use case for it.If you're out and about a lot or outdoors then yes definitely consider this phone.  It is durable, and waterproof up to 1.5 meters of water for 30 minutes according to marketing claims (I did not test this, nor did I do a drop test).Currently the AGM H5 Pro is selling for $319.99 with a $20 coupon.  I think this is a reasonable price being that it is a nich e phone with some unique features.  The battery life is incredible, but the tradeoff is that it is big and heavy.  The night vision is a novelty.  The speaker I think is a plus because you don't need to carry around a separate bluetooth speaker if you like to blast your music.  I do think this phone with its lack of 4G fits more around the $250-$280 price range, but $300 isn't bad.Overall, the H5 Pro is a solid phone, literally, for specific people and recommended.  For me and my daily use, I don't think I would carry or want to hold this phone. I ordered this phone through the Vine program (did not pay for it). If I had to pay for this, I probably would not have bought it.

This phone is one of the best phones I've ever had, I just wish I hadn't waited so long to buy it. 8-Gigabyte of ram, And 256-gigabyte internal memory, Is awesome but having ASD card slot with the internal memory would be the best thing that means you could back up everything otherwise you can't back up anything, Unless you actually had to plug in to hook it up to your laptop or an external SD card/ Flash drive."", 'Pros:1. Good battery life.  Can\'t call it great because it does not have the monster battery that some other phones do these days.  But this one gives me two full days of light use on a charge, more than enough for my purposes.  I actually switched to this from a much heavier phone that has better battery life and is more rugged.  For my current lifestyle, this lighter phone is the better choice.2. Fast processor.  If you compare this phone to flagships that cost 5 times as much, you will definitely find the flagships faster.  But compare it to the mid-range Androids from the ""big name"" brand and you will see it is more than competitive.3. Fast 5G and LTE.  No issues with connectivity.  Fast download speeds, as good as the latest fruit-branded flagship.Shortcomings:1. Can be hard to find cases and screen protectors.  The big brands have much better selections of aftermarket accessories available for purchase.2. No NFC.  Mixed feelings about this one.  I really do not use, or even want to use, NFC at this time, but if that changes, I will need to move on to a different phone model.3. Hotspot a little flaky.  Unlike some other phones I have used, the hotspot feature likes to disconnect devices too often.4. On-screen fingerprint reader works well most of the time.  That sounds like a negative but for whatever reason, I have trouble with fingerprint readers on all of the phones that have had them.None of the shortcomings are all that serious to me.  I have been using this phone as one of my daily drivers for the past three months and have no intention to replace it with something else.', ""To the point: Yes, screen is amazing, bright colors, 90 hz refresh rate, 5G capabilities, very fast processor, big storage etc. even though the battery is not that big, it does charge pretty fast.BIG annoyances: On screen finger print sensor is terrible, has a hard time reading even when first setting up, constantly displaying a PARTIAL FINGER PRINT DETECTED message, and once it's done it will have a hard time unlocking, but when it works, it unlocks with ANY unregistered f print. That's some annoying security.Also the proximity sensor doesn't work when on a call, constantly my ears press on screen buttons because the screen lights back up in the middle of a call.Volume has only 7 steps so you better like your media volume to be loud or soft.Even for the sale price I got it for these are issues no budget phone should have. I'm undecided between returning it or keeping it to flash other ROMS, either way I would not recommend this phone honestly. I really wanted to like this phone.UPDATE: On 01/18/23 Blu pushed an update. Finger print reader feels a bit more secure, although it took many many more tries I was still able to unlock with a non registered finger print. Keep it up BLU, you're getting there."", ""I recently got my hands on the Bold N2, and I must say, it's an absolute game-changer! This smartphone is packed with cutting-edge features that make it a true standout in the market.First and foremost, the 5G capability ensures lightning-fast download and browsing speeds, providing a seamless and lag-free experience. No more waiting around for pages to load or videos to buffer; the Bold N2 keeps me connected at all times, no matter where I am.The battery life is truly impressive. With its all-day battery, I can confidently use my phone for work, play, and everything in between without worrying about running out of juice. This is a massive plus for someone like me who's always on the go.The 6.6” Full HD+ AMOLED display is simply stunning! The colors are vibrant, and the clarity is top-notch, making every image and video a pleasure to behold. Whether I'm browsing through social media or watching my favorite shows, the display quality never disappoints.The internal storage capacity of 256GB combined with 8GB of RAM is more than sufficient to handle all my files, apps, and multitasking needs. I never have to worry about running out of space or experiencing performance issues.When it comes to photography, the Bold N2 truly shines. The quad 64MP main camera delivers sharp and detailed shots, even in challenging lighting conditions. Whether it's capturing breathtaking landscapes or close-up portraits, this camera never fails to impress. The dual 16MP selfie camera is equally impressive, giving me stunning selfies that are social media-ready.Lastly, the Cyprus Teal color of the Bold N2 is a delightful touch. It adds a touch of elegance and uniqueness to the phone, making it stand out in a sea of monotonous designs.The best part is that the phone is unlocked, so I can use it with any carrier of my choice, which offers the freedom and flexibility to switch between providers hassle-free.In conclusion, the Bold N2 is a true flagship smartphone that checks all the boxes - 5G capability, exceptional battery life, stunning display, ample storage and RAM, outstanding cameras, and a beautiful design. If you're looking for a smartphone that will elevate your mobile experience in 2022, I wholeheartedly recommend the Bold N2."", 'The camera takes great pictures and sound quality is good however the lack of memory card space a huge disappointment', 'Es una marca de smartphone que uso hace años..

Minor annoyance, but now I found the right way to hold it (never used a curved device before).The speaker is surprisingly loud given that it only has ONE speaker. I have heard worse, and I have heard better. This is one of the better ones.The battery lasts me almost an entire day, maybe one and a half, depending on usage. Keep in mind, I’m not a gamer. I have played some games on it to test performance, and it seemed to handle it just fine.Call quality is great. Others can hear me well, and I hear others very loudly.Fingerprint reader is pretty decent. I have only ever run into issues once or twice, but I re-added my fingerprints and the sensor is relatively quick. Face ID works flawlessly.There’s nothing I have to complain about with this device, so far. Worth every dollar and then some. Superb device. I am a beyond-happy customer and hope it continues to work this well. Will update if anything.', 'I wanted to love this product and I do in some of it\'s features. I\'ve been a BLU fan since 2016 and I have owned many of their flagship models.The bad. The curved screen looks good but makes it glitchy. I have to be very careful when handling it or it will do things I don\'t want it to do. It will sometimes glitch out for no apparent reason. It\'s easy to recover by shutting down the apps and restarting, but it is somewhat annoying. No stereo speakers. No NFC, no wireless charging, no Android 12 or 13 for that matter, no memory card slot, no headphone jack, volume control stepping still suks like on previous models, and only a 6.6"" screen...why??? I would have paid a bit more to have these things. This is supposed to be a Flagship.The good. Beautiful colors and graphics. Plenty of storage, fingerprint sensor works better than any previous BLU phones, 5G is amazing. It is fast and responsive most of the time. Build quality is excellent. The cameras work very well.']"

My previous phone was 5x faster than this and it used THE SAME INTERNALS other than the battery.Speaking of, the battery is probably the only good thing about this apart from the fingerprint reader.The speaker quality is crap and only sounds like a larger and louder version of a speaker on an $80 phone, so music just can't be enjoyed the way it was meant to be.The cameras are crap too. No matter what app I try, and no matter how clean the lenses are, I cannot get a properly clear image out of any of them regardless of what settings I use. I think I'm gonna go back to Oukitel. At least I can play my rhythm games on that because there's virtually NO DELAY. I've even had to adjust my typing speed to compensate for this things terrible touch response.AGM, you better fix this or you're losing customers to competition. They have better and faster devices at the price this thing sells at, even using the same chipsets, so you're just pushing yourselves out of the market. Not smart."", 'Beautiful Phone!  skipping the bull here is what you need to know!you break phones often?BUY THIS PHONE!FEATURES:- waterproof ( so long as rubber covers are properly popped into place and no physical damage has befallen the device to therefore change that. ) Also note, it DOES come with a replacement set of rubber port covers.- beautiful camera! I\'m no camera nut so I won\'t say much other than it is a very hyper focused image!-night vision mode.  Yes, the camera has night vision and, contrary to my expectations, IT WORKS! Really well.- Fingerprint Sensor, and not those cheap "" please clean the sensor, and try again! "" kind. This baby works smooth , has a awkward location but, runs beautiful and doesn\'t fight me on how sloppy my finger slaps the sensor.- Well-thought-out-design!  What I mean is it has rubber corner shoulder shocks in case of \'gravity tests\' , beautiful carbon fiber like finish that promotes non-slip and makes it less likely to fumble your device, a nice aesthetically pleasing speaker slapped on the back with a nice customizable LED ring surrounding it, and the overall design is complimented by strategically placed ridged and bright orange lines that outline the cameras, lead to the finger print, indicate the magnetic charger location as well as outline the front speaker above the display , I feel the need to highlight upon these as they make fumbling for your phone in the darkness a lot more friendly ! You\'ll see what I mean!-Magnetic charging supported !  To my knowledge it\'s a brand - specific charging station , however it IS an option.-Type C !! like everything should be by now!- Amazing display!  Nice backlight , not to dim, if felt it is to  bright has many different adjustments that can be made such as blue light filters, night mode sepia, etc...-Gaming phone APPROVED!!!  With 6gb of RAM there isn\'t too many things you won\'t be able to play, personally, COD mobile, MTG Arena, all of my emulators spanning from atari to ps1, and other games of mine all ran at god tier.  THOSE OF YOU WHO DON\'T GAME MUCH.  This phone is ridiculously more than you need for your everyday use and takes quite a bit to make lag.-BATTERY LIFE! just wow. did you read how much MAH that was?! that\'s a ""wow"" number! in perspective.  I got this phone at about 85%.  I unboxed it, set it up, listened to music all day ( with the LED ring doing it\'s light dance the whole time), tested my games out few about 10 minutes a piece, and still had me a good 45% left. This thing will rarely have to be charged if you don\'t override the CPU with heavy graphic games and other junk as I do !  this phone easily makes it through 24 hours with a full charge.DEFAULT APPS!  no one ever really mentions these, I don\'t know why, I find it important.This one loads up with your google everything! photos, music, email, file explorer, you name it, it\'s google!you can change this of course but I like to mention it because personally, google is great, but things like my music and tv providers I prefer to go to other apps, so note, if you are a tech nut who likes cleaner cut file explorers or simply have other app preferences, they will need to be installed after device setup! If I have your attention this far into this random ramble also note, I was very impressed with their home screen icons and layout!  Very user friendly.', 'I purchased this phone for a friend in another country. By the time she got the phone 30 days had past. The phone cannot charge. I even sent her a wireless charger and she still was unable to charge the phone. Neither Amazon nor the seller was able to resolve the problem. I will never buy electronics from Amazon again', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0This is a pretty decent smartphone for the price. First off, it is an overall beast of a phone when it comes to build quality. It is a very rugged smart phone and is thick and does have some weight to it. This is all to be expected considering what the device truly is. Despite all this, it is still pretty portable. I used this phone with a T-Mobile sim and it works just fine.The setup is very easy and yes, it does have the usual Android setup. Some of these cheaper cell phones don\'t have the initial setup, but this one does - which is something I really like. Looking through the files on the phone I didn\'t see anything that looked off or weird, either. I felt comfortable signing in to my Google Account. The Android software is pretty stock for the most part and is an experience us Android users should be pretty used to - making it easy to use and operate. There is a built in finger print reader on the back and it works well and quite quickly as well.The battery life on this is actually quite good and I averaged a few days with ""normal"" use (phone calls, texts, watching videos, etc.). The battery life will differ depending on how much or how little you use it. It does use USB-C to charge and they include a charger in the box.The touch screen is very responsive and is of a nice quality. It\'s not the best panel out there but I have seen worse and it\'s quite usable considering the price point.This phone is not a powerhouse by any means, but it doesn\'t claim to be. It did play some lighter games with no issues, but I wouldn\'t recommend doing any heavy gaming. It did play cloud games with no problems and it\'s able to allow you to multi-task relatively easy with very minimal lag.The cameras on this phone are pretty decent and take nice photos and videos. I really like the infrared camera that is built in and takes some nice photos even in total darkness - keep in mind they are not color photos, but that\'s what infrared does. I have attached a few photos and a video straight off the phone to this review.All things considered, this phone is great if you are in need of a very rugged, well built smart phone. It does work as you would expect and should hold up to most conditions with no problems. It really is a nice value for what you get.', ""Forget the tactical phone covers promising to keep them safe from drops, this phone has that built in! My husband loves this phone.It works off of T-Mobile towers, so if you don't have a provider with an agreement with AT&T or T-Mobile to use their towers, this one isn't for you. Luckily, we use Mint Mobile, paying a year at a time, so definitely a win-win situation for us!All in all, it was simple to switch everything over to it & it works great!

The phone works beautifully, it has a big screen, sharp colors, awesome speakers, and everything else you could want. 12 GB Ram + an additional 7 GB if you use the Ram extension option in settings for a grand total of 19 GB! Gaming is smooth and just amazing, you'll be able to play any game on any emulator you want. This is the equivalent of a $1,000-$1,100 Samsung or iPhone phone quality for half that amount.The only kicker of this phone is the carrier service. It MUST BE T-MOBILE, MINT, METRO PCS, OR SOMETHING THAT RUNS ON THAT NETWORK!! It only runs bands 2 and 41 in my area so you will need to check and see what bands for whatever carrier you choose you will have for the phone. In most cases, you'll have a decent amount of cell service on the 4G LTE network. Hands down, best phone I've ever owned and best price for a phone of this quality I ever owned and it isn't even close! Definitely recommended."", 'En mi caso, llevo aproximadamente 2 semanas con el producto y la verdad es que me ha encantado, en un principio me asuste un poco porque como muchos mencionan en los comentarios el nombre del producto es FOCO F4 y pense ""oh me estafaron"" nada mas lejos de la realidad, la unica cuestion es que el K050 gaming tengo entendido que es la version china y el FOCO la global, basicamente son lo mismo, por esa parte no tienen porque preocuparse.En un inicio tuve problemas al tratar de actualizar el SO pero luego de un par de intentos pude actualizarlo a MIUI 14 sin problemas.En cuanto al uso para juegos la verdad es que yo lo he probado con juegos como Genshin impact, Honkai impact, COD mobile, free fire, Fate grand order y con todos me corre muy bien (talves con genshin lo mas recomendable es tenerlo con graficos medios a 30 fps porque la verdad es un juego muy exigente, pero en mi caso no tengo problemas ya que unicamente lo juego para las Dailys y normalmente lo juego en Pc en mis tiempos libres cuando quiero darle a  full, asi que ahi depende de cada persona) en la parte del calentamiento la verdad es que se llega a calentar un poco pero en mi caso no ha habido ningun problema, creo que casi cualquier telefono tendra ese detalle si lo juegas a full y en cuanto la bateria si juego por ejemplo algo muy exigente como genshin me duraria aproximadamente de 3 a 3 horas y media a full, lo cual me parece un buen tiempo ya que me pongo a pensar en sistemas totalmente enfocados al gaming como Switch que si me pongo a jugar el zelda la misma cantidad de tiempo igual me drenaria toda la energia en practicamente el mismo tiempo... por esa parte tampoco me preocupo ya que el celular se carga de 0 a 100 en practicamente 15 a 20 minutos sin ningun problema... en conclusion si quieres darle a full gaming talves haya mejores opciones pero por el precio y calidad definitivamente este producto es una muy buena opcion a elegir', ""Not a gamer, so I can only speak from a normal smartphone user. The moment I turned it on, it began updating and Android 12 was upgraded to 13 along with Miui 13 to 14 . My first impression is quality built with metal frame and glass. Speakers plenty loud, but my Moto edge 2020 has more bass.  Tweak with eq and its great. Stereo imaging much better then my moto edge. So when watching a movie you will here sounds moving around. Especially with Dolby Atmos on. I'm on Google Fi and its fine. 5G symbol not up, but LTE+ . 180mb/sec downloads on average, which is on par with my moto edge at 5g. Battery Life is great so far. It all depends on user. I surf the net, watch some short videos, and listen to music and pod casts. With battery saver on, screen at 75% Brightness, and auto refresh rate, I still have 65 to 70% battery left after 10 hours with basic use. There is no battery that will outlast someone that is on it 24/7.  So for the average user battery life is great. Now the bad. With the phone being global and not U.S. specific model, some apps will not load and work, such as Netflix and Hulu. Play store says not compatible on this device. Probably because it is completely unlocked. Most unlocked phones are referring to not locked to any one carrier. Bootloader is still locked. On this it is completely unlocked including bootloader. Not a big deal, you can download APK file for Netflix and Hulu and load on phone and it works fine. Contactless payments will not work. Banks think phone has  been rooted and does not meet their securityrequirements. I'm Sure there is a fix for this, such as locking bootloader which is more secure or another ROM. But that's for another day. Otherwise, if you like the idea of a fast phone, great build, great screen and loud speakers, and oh yeah, charges  0 to 100% in less time than it takes to get a shower. Then this is a great phone for you."", 'Me gusto el tiempo de carga, la pantalla la camara la memoria,el procesador es rapido, y es internacional lo que no me gusto que no puedo poner una micro sd en el telefono ni audifonos', 'El teléfono llegó destapado pero al parecer nuevo, llegó sin carga de batería y tardo 10 min en encender después de conectarlo, llegó 1 día antes de la fecha estimada.Referente al equipo...

Screen is amazing. YouTube, Netflix etc are great on it.Gaming from any game on the play store to any emulator work perfect .Gamecube, Wii, PS2 , PSP and even some Switch emulation works perfect. The phone does get a bit hot but manages to work without any issues.But nothing is perfect and the main issue it’s battery life.On a good gaming session it last 2.5-4 hrs on a demanding game or emulator. You have to fully charge it twice a day. Charger is extremely fast.But my main concern is the battery lifetime.As the phone gets older so will the battery and I don’t think it will last more than a year or two. You can install a custom ROM that can slightly improve the battery but that’s optional.Overall if you can deal with those issues, the phone is an amazing and powerful machine.I use it as a second phone just for gaming .I bought the Gamesir X2 Pro and the combo it’s perfect.Also the seller I got it from is Cell Universal. Second phone I get from them. Great service, great attention to detail and instructions included when you receive the phone.They also include a car fast charger which is very useful.', 'Ya es mi cuarto relefono de la marca y es un gran equipo en todos los aspectos, con una excelente relación calidad precio, lo único que considero haría falta seria compatibilidad con red altan', 'llego un dia antes de lo previsto, llego sin pila pero en sus 25 minutos termino de cargar al 100%lo eh probado y funciona super bien los juegos muy fluidos y cumple con todo lo que se piensa', ""Love this phone upgraded to this after I broke my note 9, and I chose this model specifically: as I travel a lot and I feel in love with the astetics.Triggers are awesome for COD and I remapped them to work in AoV, they have a cool lights and sound when you engage them.Screen is very beautiful lots of features super resolution HDR and ai; I set my screen to 120hz and it is noticable any gamer that started at 60hz monitor will know what I mean.Now she does have a snapdragon 8 gen 1 so she gets warm not gaming laptop burn your lap hot but noticable warm (With out the K50 original case, will update when I receive as it was special order from China )Camera is great not the Picasso masterpiece but noticable better than iphone 14 (sister has one compared and honestly the quality especially at night looked so much better on the K50.The charging it's fast 20 minutes and your battery is full from 0% although I never get below 50% as we all know the battery life will be shorter due to the fast charge but by not letting completely drain before the next charge helps prolong it's life. Overall for 500 bucks this thing is amazing compared to the competition, this is not a flagship phone remember and in  mid tier it feels like it l. Very important this model here works with T-Mobile not Verizon not ATT.  I eneded up swapping to T mobile for this phone (I knew before buying this would be the case )""]"

Easily beats iphone 14 and hold its own ground against even S22 ultra! This is as good as it gets. Although if I have to nit-pick, the auto brightness does screw up sometimes and you will have to manually adjust the brightness for best viewing experience. Also make sure you go into setting and select 2k & 144 hz resolution. The system default out of the box is FHD+ only. I am pretty sure it’s made to save battery. onscreen fingerprint reader is reliable & works well.3. Camera: 8/10. Camera is great for most part. I have observed it works best in 4:3 aspect ratio. I like my photos to fill the screen. In 16:9 or higher aspect ratio, many a times there is fish eye effect as well some blur on the edges. If you want to compare it to the true flagships, it definitely cannot compete. But it is still one of the best cameras out there.4. Battery Life: 6/10. Battery life is average at best. 5 hours screen on time with about 13 hours runtime is the best you can expect.5. SOC: 5/10. This phone has heating issues if you are a gamer or heavy user. Normal usage, heating is not an issue. Snapdragon 8 gen 1 definitely is a big hit & miss. Do not buy this phone if you are looking for heavy usage and gaming.6. Software: 6/10. For most part the software is great. But with long term usage you will start noticing:a. Bloatware! Too many unnecessary apps, some you cannot even uninstall. The ‘Get app’ app store which is a system app and cannot be uninstalled keeps pushing you to install more bloatware!!b. Most widgets cannot be resized. Resizing widget is almost common sense now a days in android phones, cannot believe they have botched this up in this phone!c. Some high-end features like converting youtube videos into 2k in real time doesn’t work and many such features are just gimmicks at best.7. Keyboard: 5/10. There is some good haptic feedback while typing, but that is where the goodness ends. The autocorrect is downright horrible and I found typing is not that fast!8. Network: 5/10. If you are city dweller, you wouldn’t find this aspect as lacking. But if you are in hard-to-reach network places, I found this device quite lacking.

(Looses 8-15% at night, when always on display is off, vibration is off, mobile data/WiFi is off)[Update September 2022: With latest software updates, battery drain when idle seems to have resolved to some extent. Also, there is no performance sacrifices for this. So, now I wouldn't consider battery drain a huge negative point, as the charging is really fast]Also, even for for just casual usages there is slight heating issue, when outside temperature is 30-33°C (an average temperature in India; For those in cold places, there are issues too... keep reading!)On gaming, it throttles a lot along with overheating at times, maybe given performance equivalent to Snapdragon 855 or 845, when heated up! Maybe going with Mi 11 Ultra would be a better choice, or go for 8Gen1 devices from other companies or wait for 8Gen1+! I really regret the decision to buy this phone, been using it for 1 week now!!!I have been using Xiaomi products for many years, and decided to believe and buy a flagship from this company. But so far the experience is disappointing, and gives a midrange feel in many areas... Over heating when used outside, for just regular usages, like Gmail, browsing the internet, Amazon etc... Also, though the charging is fast, the battery drain is fast too...And the camera needs a lot of optimization. Daylight photos, many times it's over exposed and over saturated and cases can be reddish. And HDR doesn't always work well. Its sometimes a disappointing performance, considering its supposed to be a flagship camera! Even that can be fixed by a software update...And maybe a good Gcam port is all I can hope for, if someone makes it, as i don't have much hope from Xiaomi... But surely there are hardware issues too...Overheating is surely somewhat an hardware issue, given the negative feedback of 8Gen1...But the implementation in Mi 12 pro, seems so poor, and it makes things worse. It's advertising industry leading cooling systems, but performance isn't reflecting it!Also, i recently went to a hill station(temperature was 13-20°C) and on trying the camera there, the phone heats up even there on using camera for few minutes, and fog got formed in the internal camera lens of the main camera unit, which is quite disappointing!  (Note: it's not outside the camera, that it can be wiped, but inside the camera.And saw in online forums and YouTube that it's a general issue with this model, especially the Chinese and Indian ones! Search and you can find the issue)Hope the device doesn't get under-clocked, because I and most people who opt for a flagship care about high end performance.So Xiaomi, if you are reading this, we all hope, an alternative fix for overheating can be implemented with software that doesn't involve sacrificing the performance of 8Gen1! I will wait and see how Xiaomi takes feedback and fixes these issues(I have filled feedback using the feature provided within the phone)...I am not even sure if customer feedback is even considered and I am doubting the trust and decision of buying a premium phone from Xiaomi...On a positive note, the screen is excellent, main camera module is great in low light (though there are hiccups at times), also zoom camera isn't great, given its a 2x telephoto!The IR blaster, is a nice to have. Also it checks most of the features that is expected in a flagship. But it doesn't have an official IP rating, though they say its built to be IP 53 compliant. But flagships should be having IP 68.Performance is smooth, which is expected, but there are software glitches at times, and the issue of overheating and battery drain! As the battery keeps draining fast, and if we keep charging with 120W, battery life is a question... Don't think it will last much long!The charger is insane, but heavy and not very travel friendly....  And claimed charging speed of 18 mins isn't achievable unless phone doesn't heat up, which isn't possible unless you give it active cooling while charging!Realistically you get from 0-100% in 25-30 mins!"", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Jul 17th:-Xiaomi has released a new update today on MIUI Downloader app - V.14.0.3.0.TLBINXM.. It contains June 2023 security patch.. Owners can download this update & install it as per procedures provided by me below.. Good Luck..Apr 14th:-The phone has April 2023 security patch ready.. For users who have not got it yet.. You can install an app called ""MiUI Downloader"" & then download the latest package.. After that Go to settings >> About Phone >> continuously tap the big portion of ""14 MiUI version MiUI Global 14.0.2.. It will enable an option called ""Choose Update Package"".. Then you can choose the downloaded package and install it manually!..Also for users to be able to get updates at the earliest comparatively for MiUI you should follow this instructions:-Go to settings >> About Phone >>  Now enter ""14 MiUI version MiUI Global 14.0.2"" >> go to top right 3 dots >> Settings >> Enable - Receive Updates Early..Mar 6th:-The phone is performing very well after the last update. I started using the phone in the full performance mode under battery settings to see the experience.. I would say this is the best way to get the complete experience of the full potential of the Snapdragon 8Gen1.. I know the ultimate battery life will be less than the balance mode however the difference is not big!.. Also with its full potential the phone is just absolutely stutter free n just flows no matter what you do!.. So suggest the readers to try it out to see how it feels for yourself..The big update is I have ordered the new Xiaomi 13 Pro in mi.com and I am happy/ sad to say this is my last post here as I am exchanging my Xiaomi 12 Pro for the new phone.. I\'m so excited to experience the new monster while I\'m sad to let go off this beauty the Xiaomi 12 Pro ❤.. Easily the best phone I have owned ever in my life so far!.. Just love the Xiaomi flagships and I hope the experience remains so in the future..I wish all the best to new Xiaomi 12 Pro buyers and my ownership review should help you give confidence to own this beauty at now revised 2023 price of just 50K!.. Over & Out 👍Feb 14th:-The phone\'s UI feels so much smoother now!.. The memory management has improved vastly & battery life has improved significantly too!!.. Thanks to MiUi 14 (Android 13) improvements.. There are minor bugs nevertheless with Screen recording option disappearing all of sudden from yesterday!.. Certain settings under developer options changing by itself etc.. But these are very minor issues to worry about..Feb 11th:-Got Android 13 based MiUi14 on my phone finally!!.. Comes with Jan 2023 Android security patch.. The phone instantly feels butter smooth!!.. wooh!.. Attached screenshot of the Android version..Jan 6th:-Yet to get any security patch after Sep 2022!.. It has been 4 months since now.. I\'m disappointed frankly in terms of updates.. I understand that the phone is due & should be amongst 1st to get Android 13 based MiUI 14 to arrive anytime now.. But that is not an excuse to not provide this long!.. I expected a Dec 2022 update atleast by now..In terms of battery there has been a decline in backup esp when on mobile data.. Thanks to 5G network now.. For whatever reason the auto brightness of the phone is continuously very high than what is required (adding to average battery performance).. There has been a few stutters in the UI I\'m noticing which could be again related to lack of updates!.. Also I notice very aggressive RAM management performance where certain apps get killed immediately as soon as I get out of it!.. Possibly it\'s got to do with MiUI\'s irritating battery saving attempt..Anyways hoping for some improvements in my next update.. Fingers crossed..Nov 27th:-Got my vodafone primary sim ported to Airtel & have Jio as my secondary sim.. Both are giving me 5g internet with Jio giving consistently more 5g connectivity than Airtel. The Phone is blazing fast now in terms of browsing & YouTube etc.. Attaching some screen for 5g performance of the phone!..Oct 19th:-Got an update to enable 5g services for the phone. Under settings though I don\'t see any changes.Had been to Kashmir vacation where the phone was used fully.. The battery loss was quiet significant outdoors on mobile data with 2 sim cards.. The main reason for it is it\'s display that\'s almost at full brightness in auto mode.. Also due to poor signals in Kashmir, the phone is continously working to look for a stable mobile network.. The photos came out fantastic for it\'s segment & I was comparing it against iPhone 13 Mini/ iPhone 12 Pro/ iPhone 12/ S20 FE 5G of my cousins.. A lot of times my cousins preferred me to take the main cam shots from Xiaomi 12 Pro over others!.. The selfie performance was average at best though.. The telephoto/ zoom performance was toe to toe with iPhone 12 Pro in both photos & videos!!.. Coming to the most controversial video shooting performance, most of the videos ranging from 30 secs to nearly 10 mins in the most unique HDR10+ quality came out fabulous!!.. The video quality was not comparable to iPhone 12 Pro/ 13 as soon as the natural lights came down though.. The iPhones showed their superiority clearly in low light/ sunset videos..Will keep updating my experience further as days go..Oct 9th:-Have got September security patch. The routine is one security patch every 2-3 months typical of Xiaomi.. The update had nothing else other than security patch in it..The phone is otherwise performing same n is top notch & Im extremely happy with the device..Sep 17th:-Performance of the phone has improved now!.. Xiaomi has done some magic.. Even the phones highest cpu temperature against any load is only 60 degrees as against 75 degrees before!Attaching new benchmark app results..Aug 29th:-Attaching some screenshots from my phone for all the battery life cribbers & potential customers & interested fellows..I got a Screen On Time (SOT) of over 7:30 hours today!!!.. See for yourself before judging the battery life of Xiaomi 12 Pro.. I have also attached a set of screenshots from my phone settings that affect battery life..Always give time to your phone & the advanced AI in it to start reading what kind of user it is working with!.. My phone is 20+ days old now & it has learnt how I use my phone & how to optimise it.. So dont jump to conclusions by looking at your phone in hours!!..My phone today was used indoors mainly with mostly on Wifi but has 2 SIMs in it.. Bluetooth on for occasional smartphone connectivity & other settings in the screenshot.. Also reiterating that the phone has very good standby battery time too even with Always On Display..Aug 25th:-Attaching 4K@60fps video of 2 mins length.. I tried attaching 5 mins video I shot but Amazon says the file is too big to be attached!.. So I can\'t upload the 5 mins video.. What I can confirm though is no camera fogging visible anymore in the rear sensor.. Nor is the video shootage (both videos) had any fogging visible at all!!.. Remember we are talking about a phone that had it originally..After 5+2 mins of 4K@60fps, the phone was warm.. The battery temperature showed 45 degrees max.. Just FYI..Aug 24th:-I see a lot of customers are unhappy with the phone after purchasing as there is fog in the rear camera. They rate the phone 1 star & want to return it.. It\'s their wish as it\'s their product/ money..But I had a suggestion to kind off resolve this issue as I have done for my phone.. I made 2 videos today to test the situation.. 5 mins 4K@60fps videos each from the main rear sensor.. I had no fogging issues to note!!.. Just to remind the readers, my phone also had camera fogging issue while shooting videos from the main cam in the past (have made a note of it in my review below for reference)..So what did I do to resolve the issue.. Just shoot 5 mins length 4K@60fps videos from the main camera.. Shoot 10 videos back to back of 5 mins length in the same resolution.. The phone will heat up badly.. Let it heat up.. Once done shooting 10 videos.. Come out of the camera app & leave the phone to cool down.. Don\'t bother shooting a video to test anymore.. Give it 1 days time & meanwhile use your phone normally for any other function.. Test the video the next day & check whether the issue persists.. If it still does, you can return the product.. Otherwise all well & good.. I lost both 5 mins videos I shot this evening.. I will update a 5 mins video in a day or 2 for you to see the video quality yourself n whether there\'s any foggy tone in the video..Aug 20th:-Bought Xiaomi 12 Pro for 50K on Aug 7th in sale after card & coupon discounts.. Below is my experience so far in these 12 days;-Like to start with the display which is the best part about the phone.. This is one of the best ever screens on any smartphone ever!!.. A curved display that is 6.73"" E5 Amoled that is 120hz, LTPO 2, 10 Bit, QHD+, Dolby Vision, with 1050 nits max brightness (gsmarena tested) screen.. That has wonderful viewing angles, absolutely stunning hardware with no screen leak or dirty screen effects like it\'s competitors\' inconsistent/ poor QCd units!.. Absolute ❤.. A few cons that I noticed though is the phone has more accidental touch issue due to curved screen than say my previous phones iQOO 9Pro & Samsung Note20Ultra.. Also the phone doesn\'t come with a pre applied screen protector.. Had to get a good quality screen protector for 1000 rupees..Nextly the speakers & audio quality.. It\'s got Harmon Kardon tuned quad speakers (2 woofers + 2 tweeters), with 2 dedicated outlets, that is excellent.. Yes, it\'s not the loudest esp when compared to iphones & Samsung flagships & Oneplus flagships.. But the quad speakers show their speciality with a full range of sound & with it\'s richness during any kind of audio output.. Compared the audio with my wife\'s iPhone 12 (as good as any iphone 13 series) & that\'s where I make these observations.. Also I\'ve owned Samsung flagships in the past to add on to the experience..Design & Build wise.. the phone is of the highest order possible with excellent design & color options along with a solid/ very stylish metal frame that syncs with Gorilla Glass Victus display on the front & Gorilla Glass 5 glass on the hind.. The bezels in the top & bottom isn\'t the snallest of all though n the curve at the edges could be more boxy for my liking than the current design that\'s more roundish.. All in all the phone syncs overall with the Purple hue beautifully to make it a piece of art!.. The only sore miss is an IP68 rating sadly..MiUi 13 on the phone is running July 2022 security update & the UI is polished & has excellent animations n look n feel!.. I have used phones with One UI, Color OS, Realme UI, Funtouch OS, iOS, Stock Androids (never used Oxygen OS though).. My most favorite UI for style n look n animations & feel has to be MiUI amongst all!.. The sheer array of Wallpapers (incl free Live Wallpapers), Themes, Fonts that\'s available for free is unbelievably good n incomparable!!.. The way the haptics have been integrated into the UI is best of all to add on.. The haptic motor is amongst the best too!.. All is not roses for MiUI though with slightly lower stability in terms of smoothness & consistency when compared to Color OS & One UI which are butter smooth.. The battery & general optimization is very well done though.. There were about 5-6 unwanted apps out of the box but most were straight uninstall while a few others I could remove using the adb function.. Overall very happy with the software experience so far.. Also adding on is a promise of 3 Major Android  updates until Android 15 & security patches for 4 years!.. What is to be noted is Xiaomi doesn\'t provide prompt monthly updates.. It is only periodic like say once in 2 to 4 months which is not great..Call quality over ear piece & mic & speaker is excellent.. The signal reception for sim card of various vendors - Vodafone/ Airtel/ Jio is all fine with very rare issues (I blame it to poor service than phone).. Wifi performance is fabulous with the best mobile modem attached to Snapdragon 8Gen1.. Bluetooth connectivity, NFC n all other modes of connectivity are top notch.. So very happy with these most primary functions on any phone..Cameras wise the highlight is the primary rear custom made 50MP sensor Sony IMX707 which is fantastic in literally every condition for photography!.. It has 1 big issue that has to be addressed though.. The rear primary camera fogging while shooting video for anything more than 1.5 mins.. But this rear camera fogging isn\'t consistent & sometimes it doesnt do it n fine too inbetween!.. But it\'s inconsistent for it\'s unpredictable performance.. The Ultrawide & Telephoto/ Portrait cameras consist of 2 50MP Samsung JN1 sensors respectively.. This is an excellent setup & they work very well for most functions.. The Telephoto/ Portrait cam has only 2X Optical zoom but that\'s a good enough feature with sharp & pleasing zoom pics.. The Telephoto cam lacks OIS which is a miss according to me & wouldve helped in low light zoom.. Similarly the Ultrawide cam lacks Autofocus & that doesn\'t make it a Macro cam which is sad.. All 3 rear cams can shoot good quality 4K@60fps videos with excellent stability!.. The night time photo/ video shooting is also top notch thanks to excellent implementation of bright flash with good flash timing & length to assist.. Overall very capable rear cameras.. Selfie cam wise it\'s a 32MP Omnivision sensor which isn\'t great hardware wise.. I would\'ve wished a top Sony sensor instead.. The dynamic range of the selfie is very limited.. The phone takes a full 32MP snap & isn\'t pixel binned yet the sharpness isn\'t great n the photos come out slightly soft.. Yet Xiaomi\'s excellent post processing capabilities make the selfie cam Above Average overall for stills.. Night mode in selfie helps brighten the screen for additional light while autofocus assistance by the AI system for selfie helps a great deal overall.. Selfie video shooting is capped at 1080p@60fps resolution at max but has very good stability due to EIS.. Overall a very good camera experience considering I\'m not too much of a video shooter..Battery backup has been good.. Yes I\'m saying good unlike many in this forum.. The users should understand that the phone has an SOC thats amongst the fastest & more powerful on the planet n a sportscar can never give you a commuter car\'s fuel efficiency!.. Well apart from this logic have attached a couple of screenshots where I have easily recorded over 6hrs of Screen On Time!.. This is with always only at 120hz + QHD+ + Other visual enhancement settings + Always on display all the time + Live Wallpaper + high haptics but with only dark mode & Auto brightness enabled (Auto brightness is generally on high brightness most of the times).. The phone has excellent idle time battery optimization thanks to MiUI.. The 120 watts charger tops up the phone in quick time but has a USB Type A to Type C connectors.. It isn\'t say as fast charging as iQOO 9 Pro\'s more mordern Type C to Type C port that charges more faster.. Finally the heating aspect of the phone.. Please note that amongst the Snapdragon 8Gen1 phones like - Samsung S22 series, OnePlus 10Pro, iQOO 9Pro, Realme GT2 etc.. Only Xiaomi 12 Pro has unrestricted 8Gen1 speed (ie not downclocking the chipset in the fear of overheating).. The phone consistently scores above 9 lacs in Antutu with CPU score of over 2 lacs no matter any condition unlike all of it\'s competitors!.. The others have downclocked their chipsets to control overheating.. What this means is Yes the chipset is notorious for overheating when stressed.. I have seen a max of 75 degrees celcius of CPU & 50 degrees of battery Temperature when pushed to it\'s extreme in Antutu test.. Also when I shot multiple 4K videos of 5 mins length for more than 30 mins at a stretch, got a message saying the phone has overheated & give it a break.. So yes the phone has overheating issue but again only when pushed to heavy duty.. Otherwise for regular operation it is fine.. Runs at a CPU temperature ranging from 40 to 50 degrees & battery from 32 to 42 degrees which is normal..The fingerprint sensor is a regular optical unit.. It is nowhere near as fascinating/ secure/ fast as iQOO 9 Pro\'s 3D Ultrasonic unit that\'s just the best ever!..On the whole at 50K there cannot be a better smartphone than this ever!.. Really happy with the phone also considering it\'s cons..I whole heartedly recommend this phone to all until you are a frequent video shooter & a gamer (overheating issue)..', ""U should definitely know the product befour u have one it's nearly 53000 past months ........and it look nice but when I used 3months I got some issues............mainly battery drains fast when compared to 27000+ mobile phone but u got 120wt fast changer....but  u carry at all time?2.

Not good in terms of battery , need to change 2 or three times in a day, but good point is that fast charging, camera is nice 👍', ""Guys you would not need to read any other review after this one. I will sum it up very clearly.This phone is a BEAST! I have only rated it 3 stars because of xaiomi not taking care of their best phone in the market, even i had to return it as well due to reasons I will mention below. I ordered this phone via an exchange of an old phone with broken screen in the sale which made this phone cost me around 35k which was a decent price since I always buy phones from 20k to 35k. The moment I received the mobile i was gone crazy. The way it looked was awesome, the way it felt in the hand was great, very premium! Massive 120 watt charging in just 20 mins was so lovely. I have used Lenovo,Vivo,poco, samsung,one plus but this one is the most wonderful looking phone I have ever held. Screen so responsive that even iPhone seems it's child. Camera so fantastic that i fell in love with the first video i recorded with it. potrait shot is whole new level. Great stabilization in the camera and speakers in the phone is just a cherry on top of the cake. Apart from this AI features to add a crisp on your video experience. Back camera is the just amazing but the front is just ok in comparison with the back one but does good enough. Now why did i only give it 3 stars and returned it. Well reason was that it had a minor issue of heating too much and battery draining quickly which was a little wears because I wasn't using the device heavily. I am very use to using mobiles and I know how fastly does a phone battery drain based on the usage but the the unit I got was draining unnecessarily but apart from battery everything else was a charm mind it guys so I ordered a replacement later, the next unit i received was a nightmare because this time I was having issues with the camera but not with the battery. The battery this time was draining according to my usage. Since it has tones of features supporting the next level amoled display so battery consumption was similar to that and I was pretty much ok with this device because it has a massive 120 wt charging which in 20 mins charged the phone from 20 to 100. So who cares if you get to charge your phone twice a day.But this unit has serious issues with the back camera. Fogs accumulated everytime I used the phone to make videos. This was irritating so I had to return it again. Remember friends the first unit i received had a battery issue and the second i received had a camera issue which means xaiomi is not taking care of the phone manufacturing up to the mark. The phone is excellent only if anyone gets the right unit.Now who should buy it?The one who has a good amount of savings with himself who can just buy a phone with a flaw or two, doesn't care if the unit had a battery issue or like that. I would have kept the phone avoiding the battery issue in the first unit since it can be charged in 15 minutes if i had good savings which I don't 😂 so I had to return it.If someone wants to know more about this phone he can mail me his queries at shashankkshekharr1990@gmail.com. i will happily clear any doubts."", ""Lets review of this mobile by using 30days1.

Juli 2022Gekauft für: EUR 549,90Ich versuche es kurz und knapp auf die wichtigsten Punkte zu reduzieren!Inhaltsverzeichnis-Beweggrund des Kaufes (unnützes blabla :P )-Ankunft des Artikels (unnützes blabla :P )-Design und Verarbeitung-Leistung-Kamera-Akku-Fazit-Beweggrund des Kaufes:Ich habe mir schon geraume Zeit Poco Handys angesehen. Die Preis/Leistung ist TOP! Es steht Xiaomi hinter der Marke und hat somit schon massiv Erfahrung. Xiaomi ist inzwischen selbst auch schon teurer, da etabliert auf dem Markt. UND ich fand die Farbe Gelb besonders. Wer hat schon ein gelbes Handy auf der Straße?Die Überlegung ein Poco in Gelb als Zweithandy zu kaufen war geboren:)Gemacht habe ich es jedoch erst einmal nicht, klar für was ein zweites Telefon. Man benutzt eh nur eins und da ich immer vorsichtig damit umgehe dachte ich mir brauche ich kein Backup.Tja und dann kam der Juli..... und mein Fold 3 verabschiedete sich ohne zutun ... Der innere Bildschirm brach... Aktuell noch offen ob ich auf den Kosten sitzen bleibe...Nun musste schnell ein Ersatz her, da ich nun unbedingt das Fold in die Reparatur geben wollte. Also wieder an Poco gedacht und geschaut was es denn so gibt. Schnell war ich beim F4 GT angekommen. Preis/Leistung fand ich sehr gut und die Specs sprachen für sich. Und dann auch noch der Rabatt den es zu dem Zeitpunkt gab. Andere Hersteller kosten hier einige 100€ mehr.  Also BESTELLT :) ( Spoiler: das Fold3 wird verkauft nachdem es repariert ist, ich liebe das F4 GT zu sehr )-Ankunft des Artikels:Es war der 15.07.22 ich bin Mittags in der Pause schnell zur Packstation da ich es kaum erwarten konnte:) In der Arbeit angekommen noch in den letzten Minuten ausgepackt und den Kollegen gezeigt(Alles IT-ler). Die waren ebenfalls ganz gespannt darauf. Jeder pflichtete mir bei, die Verarbeitungsqualität ist super. Das Handy ist sehr wertig! Schutzfolie ist schon auf dem Handy angebracht, klar nur eine dünne Plastikfolie und keine aus Glas, jedoch besser als nichts! Und die Farbe erst :) Es ist einfach etwas neues! nicht immer nur Schwarz/Weis/Grau-Design und VerarbeitungDer Metallrahmen ist absolut perfekt verarbeitet und die Rückseite aus mattem Glas unterstreicht dieses ersten überragenden Eindruck.Die Farbe Gelb ist eher Richtung Gold angelehnt und lässt es super schön wirken.Alles an diesem Gerät ist perfekt verarbeitet.Jedes Handy sollte dieses haptische Feedback bei den Tasten haben.Gamingtasten sind ausfahrbar und können konfiguriert werden (anbei Screenshots)Fingerabdrucksensor im An/Auschalter -> empfinde ich als Bereicherung. Ein Sensor unter dem Display reagiert mit trockenen Fingern nicht immer so gut. Aber dieser Sensor im Bruchteil einer Sekunde.Der Sound gehört mit dem spürbaren Bass zu den besten im Handysegment.Einzig schade ist das dieses Handy nicht Wasserdicht ist.-Leistung und SystemBester Prozessor auf dem Markt im Jahr 2022.Ja der Prozessor kann warm werden, jedoch muss hier ein extrem anspruchsvolles Spiel oder eher sogar noch ein Benchmark laufen gelassen werden das dieser im Thermal Throtteling viel eingreift. Im Endefekkt geht das Handy nach meiner Meinung bei keinem aktuelln Spiel in die Knie. Endgegner ist hier aber die Sonne -> einfach mal eine Stunde in der prallen Sonne mit Display nach oben liegen lassen XD Dann ist es eine Herdplatte und du kannst dir n Ei machen und dein Handy schaltet sich sicherheitshalber aus :P-KameraHier habe ich die Erwartungen von Anfang an heruntergeschraubt. Auch das Fold 3 war nicht der Hammer.Kurzum die Hauptkamera lieferte dann doch richtig ab, hätte ich nicht erwartet. Egal ob Tag oder Nacht. Auch 4k 60 FPS sind top.Die anderen Kameras sind ok aber das war es auch schon.Klar es kommt nicht an die Kameraflaggschiffe jenseits der 1000€ ran, dies muss es auch nicht bei dem Preis.-AkkuIch schaffe locker den Tag. Oft sogar bis zu 2 Tage ohne es zu laden.Wenn jedoch gespielt wird geht der Akku schon etwas schneller leer, das schafft aber jedes Handy.Wer ein Samsung hat wird sich hier wundern. Werder mein S20 noch mein Fold 3 haben annähernd bei gleicher Nutzung diese Laufzeit erreicht.Und das Thema Akku laden -> Das 120W Netzteil pumpt das Handy in ca. 15 in Rand voll.Induktives Laden gibt es jedoch nicht! Gut kann man verschmerzen bei 2 Tagen Laufzeit und in 15 min voll. Jedoch war ich daran schon arg gewöhnt.-Fazit++Preis++top Leistung++Design und Haptik at its best++Fingerprint 100% Erkennungsrate in 0 komma nichts++Akku+Sound im Handysekment in der Top Kathegorie+Hauptkamera liefert ab-nicht Wasserdicht-keine InduktionIch bin mit diesem Handy glücklicher wie davor mit dem Fold3 und dem S20klare Kaufempfehlung', 'Das Poco F4 GT ist ein bemerkenswertes Smartphone, das sich durch eine beeindruckende Kombination aus leistungsstarken Spezifikationen, fortschrittlicher Technologie und benutzerfreundlichen Funktionen auszeichnet.

En cuanto lo encendí por primera vez, automáticamente me saltó el mensaje de actualizar el teléfono a la versión 14 de MIUI, que es el sistema operativo que usa este terminal, y como digo, de momento todo perfecto. Si la cosa cambia ya editaré esta reseña.PROS:- Sin duda alguna, el hecho de que tenga un cargador de 120W y que el teléfono se cargue totalmente en poco más de 15 minutos, es todo un acierto.- La cámara trasera hace muy buenas fotos y la delantera tampoco está nada mal para selfies y demás. La pantalla FHD+ es bastante buena y se ve todo con colores muy vívidos y realistas.- Su procesador y su memoria RAM, así como su capacidad de almacenamiento interno de 256 GB, ampliables hasta 1TB con una tarjeta MicroSD, no están nada mal y abre las aplicaciones rápidamente y con bastante fluidez.CONTRAS:- A pesar de que tiene un cargador excelente, este teléfono tiene un serio problema con la batería, que es de 4500 mAh cuando para un terminal como este, debería ser mínimo de 5000, ya que la batería se consume muy deprisa (sobretodo si pones la frecuencia de la pantalla a 120 Hz, que entonces ya no te dura ni 12 horas), y con un uso medio hay que estar cargando el teléfono cada día.- En el apartado sonido lleva integrado un altavoz a cada lado del teléfono, no obstante, y a pesar que el sonido es JBL y que se oye bastante bien, en ocasiones se notan las carencias de sonido y es bastante mejorable.', 'Pagato oltre 70€ in meno rispetto alle offerte trovate nei vari negozi!Preso come ""muletto"" avendo come telefono principale un iPhone 14 pro max, ero interessata in particolare alla fotocamera che è ""ni"".. ottima nella risoluzione ma colori troppo freddi e, nonostante io abbia disattivato il ""filtro bellezza"" sembra sempre attivo con una patina che non mi piace!Direi 7/10 le foto, per il resto tutto fenomenale!

A livello di ""motore"" (inteso come RAM e processore) si tratta di un telefono da circa 300, ma alcune sue caratteristiche (memoria da 256 GB, ricarica super veloce, display OLED e 5G) fanno lievitare il prezzo fino a 400 euro. Ad oggi, Gennaio 2023, è un prezzo in linea con la concorrenza pur se più alto rispetto al periodo pre-covid (in cui sarebbe potuto costare indicativamente 330-360 euro) ma niente che faccia gridare alla truffa.Peccato davvero per la fotocamera, che non fa gridare al miracolo se non in poche sparute occasioni (soprattutto con buona luminosità e, talvolta, in modalità notte). In generale comunque è una fotocamera più che dignitosa per i ""fotografatori occasionali"" come me e alcune foto sono comunque buone a tal punto da poter essere stampate.

Seguem minhas primeiras impressões: Ele é bem rápido para navegar, abrir e fechar páginas, fazer downloads. Esse modelo permite que se tenha 2 espaços ou partições (para uso privativo ou trabalho), mas achei a velocidade lenta de  entrada/saída nesses compartimentos ( ele tem um delay para vc acessar os apps de um ou outro espaço, parece que ele ""pensando"" sobre o que tem que fazer entre um e outro compartimento).  Estou usando o 5G, realmente o acesso a internet ficou mais acelerado, mas consome também mais bateria, e é importante ainda avaliar se esse uso vale a pena pois o 5G também custa mais na operadora.  Ao meu ver, a câmera é de boa qualidade, tanto a frontal quanto a traseira. O som também é muito bom( limpo e de bom volume). O reconhecimento digital é adequado e rápido. Optei por  não usar o reconhecimento facial pelas implicações de segurança que pode acarretar e isto já está alertado pela própria Xiaomi. Suporta até 1 TB de memória extra (SD Card) mas infelizmente não pode ter 2 cartões SIM( a bandeja é a  mesma) ao mesmo tempo, se você utilizar um SD Card. Acho um ponto negativo pois há celulares de outras marcas, que contemplam as 3 possibilidades( 2 SIM + 1 SD Card). Diria também que ele tem uma bateria boa mas não surpreendente.  Exemplo:  Utilizando ele de 3:00 a.m até 14:00 p.m ( em torno de 11 horas de uso, não intenso, não contínuo, sem jogar, sem fazer downloads,etc)  a bateria tem ficado com 40% da carga, em média. Se ele for utilizado mesmo nessa  forma mediana,  durante todo dia/ noite, não há indícios que se tenha bateria até ao final de 24 horas ou até antes mesmo. O fato dele ter uma ultra rapidez no carregamento e isso é muito divulgado como um trunfo da Xiaomi ( sem dúvida, ele vai de 10% a 100% em 20 minutos de carregamento). Mas isso poderá acarretar também um desgaste mais rápido na bateria, pois você será tentado a fazer um novo carregamento durante o dia ainda, por isso, não vi vantagens de longo prazo nessa característica. O cabo de carregamento é curto e isso parece ser uma prática atual dos fabricantes, independente da marca . Como já se sabe, ele não com auriculares. A capa que o acompanha é desconfortável , principalmente na parte inferior, onde você tem que apoiar e segurar o celular, pois coincide com os ranhuras para carregamento e saída de som, nada ergonômica,  embora  seja feita de um material de qualidade.', 'Tenía un Xiaomi redmi note 9 pro, decidí comprar este por la descripción de la cámara, pero he decir que no es lo que esperaba.

Sobre as propagandas, ele vem habilitado pra reproduzir uma centena de propagandas de app chineses a cada instante que vc inicia algum app, o que é um saco. Foi necessário pesquisar videos para descobrir como desabilitar. Consegui desabilitar 90% das propagandas mas ainda tem um video maledeto que insiste em aparecer quando faço a limpeza do aparelho.

My main con is battery life. Out of the box it doesn't last as long as a 4800mah battery should but it charges fast. This is a cheaper phone and a smart buy if you simply need a smart phone."", 'I\'ve bought Motorolas for a long time now. I\'ve ventured out to Samsung and LG on occasion, but I\'ve always come back. Motorola makes great solid, reliable midrange phones with about as authentic of an Android experience you can get. I was reluctant after the company was acquired by Lenovo, but I can attest they\'re still good phones.I bought this to replace my Moto X4 not because the Moto X4 was broken or didn\'t work, but because I wanted to take advantage of wireless android auto in my Jeep and the newest OS for the X4 was incompatible. I had gotten my money\'s worth out of that phone already anyways.One of my favorite changes is that the fingerprint reader is built into the power button.. this is MILES better than any in-screen fingerprint reader I\'ve used. It\'s almost instantaneous. Press the power button like normal and it likely already processed your fingerprint and unlocked the phone.Battery life, as with all of my Motorolas, seems to be a step above the other brands.Other than a Pixel, Motorola offers as close to an authentic Android experience as you\'ll find. They\'re not trying to force you into some stupid ecosystem you don\'t want. Bloatware is minimal. Again, this is why I keep coming back to Motorola.Screen quality is very good. I used to think anything greater than 1080p on a little phone is overkill, but I admit the text does look noticeably more crisp.I have two disappointments, which are fairly minor:1) The phone has stereo speakers built-in, but as others have noted, the second speaker is just the earpiece, and therefore it\'s much quieter than the main speaker, giving it a lopsided soundstage. I guess it\'s better than nothing, but not by much. Speaker quality is still decent, but nowhere near iPhone quality. I\'ve yet to hear an Android that competes, though.2) Camera software seems laggy/low FPS. I\'m guessing it has to do with the multiple cameras and the phone processing them together to create one image, but it feels like the camera ""viewfinder"" runs at <30fps. The images that come out are still good. Again, not iPhone quality, but perfectly good for a midrange-priced Android phone. I was just disappointed compared to my Moto X4 because that thing was always smooth as butter and image quality was 90% of what this fancy three-camera setup achieves. I still think these multi-camera setups are a bit of a gimmick. Or maybe Android/Motorola just aren\'t utilizing them optimally.All of my other complaints are with Android itself, so they\'d be present on any brand. Having owned both iPhones and Androids, I like Android for their flexibility, but with each new version of Android I feel drawn back to the \'everything just works like it should\' quality that iOS has. Apple feels like it was designed by a small group of people who understood the mission well; Android sometimes feels like it was designed by a thousand of different people who never talked to each other. As these mobile OSs get more complex and feature packed, I\'m starting to think I\'d rather have stability than flexibility/customisation. For my next phone, I may go back to iPhone... Again, though, this is not specific to this phone--just Android itself. So I guess this rant wasn\'t really necessary..Good phone if you\'re looking for an Android! Not the best-of-the-best, but a great balance of capability and price. Probably the sweet-spot of the market.', 'Esto va a parecer comercial pero es la verdad.Me lo pensé mucho para regresar a Android después de casi 10 años con Apple, pero los precios de iPhone ya son ridículos y las mejoras entre una versión y otra (de hardware y software) son prácticamente nulas . No me equivoqué. Este teléfono me costó poco menos de MXN$7,000 y estoy totalmente satisfecho.Funciona bien con telcel, viene desbloqueado y solo tuve que ponerle la sim card, e inmediatamente tuve servicio.La cámara del teléfono no es terrible, aunque no se compara con la calidad y respuesta de la cámara de iPhone. En lo personal Android siempre me ha parecido que procesa las fotos de un modo raro, y siempre se ven de poca calidad, o demasiado digitalizadas. Sin embargo, para lo que cuesta un iPhone 13 o 14, mejor compro por separado una cámara semiprofesional. Para los recuerditos y compartir fotos en el momento con la familia esta cámara funciona bien.Fuera de la cámara, todo lo demás es una maravilla. La batería carga rapidísimo y la carga dura mucho tiempo. Aún después de ponerle batería nueva original al iPhone 7 tenía que cargarlo siempre diario, a veces hasta dos veces al día por la lentitud de la carga y era necesario llevar un banco de energía o podía quedarme sin teléfono en la tarde noche.Casi todos mis servicios (Calendario, Contactos, servicios en la nube, Música, noticias, podcasts, etc) están con google y la integración de estos con Android es impecable. El asistente de voz es superior a Alexa y a Siri por muchísimo, y el control de los dispositivos inteligentes de la casa es mucho más facil e intuitivo, además nunca tengo problemas de compatibilidad.El Motorola Edge 2021 tiene un buen diseño, el lector de huella está en un costado y no tiene botones físicos sobre la pantalla. El tamaño y la calidad de la pantalla y la interfaz de Android 12 están a la par, e incluso superan a iOS.

So I will say this phone, the 2021 edge is a good deal at 230.00 dollars.  Ni way is it worth the 700.00 dollars it cost when it came out. My stylus 2022 4g had more customizing features....Update:✔️After a few days I am definitely noticing the difference in speed. Screen might be a little better than the stylus 2022 4g. Screen specs are the same. Camera much better on the edge. I thought not having Dolby Atmos on the edge was going to be a let down but actually sounds better with same setup as I had on my stylus. This phone does get LDAC as long as your headphones are capable of LDAC. A letdown is that No type of Stylus pen will work on the edge. You have to move up to the Edge+  that's the only knock I have on it. I bought the Quick Charge 3.0 Fast wall charger power adapter for android which was suggested for this phone. 18W.

Coming from a Galaxy S10 Plus to this phone to put my review into context. I figured a brand new mid range phone like this would be on par with my 3 year old flagship S10+ phone. This phone has some better points but one serious downside. The pros: better battery, 120hz refresh rate (I didn't notice any difference but the S10+ doesn't have this) and that's about it. The serious downsides are as follows: No wireless charging, bit sluggish performance in general, No headphone jack (I have a pair of wireless overear headphones and also wireless earphones and actually these also came bundled with wireless Buds on a promotional deal but the lack of a headphone jack is still unwelcome), lastly and most importantly the cameras on this phone are dreadful. Not the picture quality, which is fine, but the time it takes to open the camera app and then to actually take a picture. I'm not sure what the issue is, maybe the processor or the ram just isn't up to the job but it always leads to frustration with me missing moments I wanted to capture because the camera was just too slow and the moment passed or it caused people to say take the picture already and I couldn't because either the app hadn't opened or the phone just wouldn't let me snap a photo. It seriously takes 2-3 seconds between each photo. It was impossible to take photos any faster than this. In the end I've sold the phone after 10 weeks bought another flagship phone which can snap easily 20-30 photos in the time it took this phone to take 2. I'm not exaggerating either.If photogaphy is a big deal for you in a phone give this one a miss. If you couldn't care less for photography then I would recommend this as a decent phone for the price. - November 2022 update - >> The flagship I bought was the iPhone 13 pro max but I decided I wanted android so I’ve sold that too and got my hands on a galaxy s20fe 4g. Brilliant phone, does everything and reasonably fast camera shutter speed. I got it refurbished, it arrived the day after purchase and looking brand new, even with all the plastic protective stickers, just in a generic box. Got it from backmarket. I’d recommend the s20fe over the a53 5g. Also 5g is not really any better than 4g so don’t be persuaded by that. Check out mrwhosetheboss YouTube video on ‘why 5g sucks’.""]"

in una scatola di cartone stampato di cui la foto frontale cambia in base al colore scelto (vi evita errori di colore😏), all\'interno troviamo:-il cellulare-il cavetto type C a type C, dati e ricarica-la chiavetta per aprire lo sportello SIM-documentazione minimaleMade in India.Non è presente l\'alimentatore o cuffiette (meglio evitare ciarpame).Ne ho comprati due, uno bianco e uno nero per sostituire un a31 (diventato instabile, andava in crash spesso ed è dovuto andare in assistenza una volta in passato, per anomalie nella memoria intasata da dati inesistenti) e un m31 (ancora in buono stato, mai problemi rilevanti👍).Pro-compatibile con microSD, FONDAMENTALE 👍-smart switch permette il cambio agevolmente per il trasferimento di dati e preferenze... in passato era piacevole come un trapianto di cuore 😆-audio: più potente in volume e più avvolgente, drastico upgrade-5G ma dalle mie parti è fantasia, è già instabile la rete normale.-rilevatore impronte, molto più veloce e reattivo, per velocizzarlo ulteriormente ho tolto l\'animazione di sblocco inutile.La sua nuova posizione sullo schermo è comodissima, molto meglio di averlo laterale o dietro, in più si illumina.Non ho provato il riconoscimento del viso.-buona calibrazione del colore delle foto, non troppo anemica (m31)o pesante (a73 dalle video recensioni).Sul mio vecchio m31 i colori venivano sempre spenti, a me piacciono vivi e vibranti, mediamente saturi senza perdere troppo realismo, direi bene sul nuovo A33, voto 8/10, si potrebbe rendere i colori ancora un pò più vivaci di poco, del 15%.Fa foto e video discreti, voto 7.5/10.Forse il flash è leggermente più potente ma di poco.-discreta durata della batteria, si arriva facilmente ad un giorno e mezzo con uso medio.-i bordi piatti e la finitura satinata lo rendono meno scivoloso in mano, presa migliore, non serve ridurre lo spessore.-i bordi della presa type C non sono fastidiosi sfregandoli, sui vecchi modelli lo erano-veloce e fluido nel funzionamento (gaming non testato).-resistente all\'acqua-compatibile con piastre magnetiche XL, in foto-si sporca di meno della scocca nero lucido dell\'m31, ed è molto più bello nero opaco.-marca molto venduta e presente in laboratori privati di assistenza non ufficiale, buona diffusione di massa e non elittaria / chiusa.Neutro-entrata jack audio abbandonata, penso sia inevitabile e il futuro comunque basta usare cuffiette type C / wireless o un adattatore.-rispetto ad a31 la scocca plastica ha un aspetto buono ma meno premium comunque belli i colori opachi, specie sul nero, soggettivamente mi piace parecchio.-Mi auguro una durata hardware e stabilità software migliore di A31 (insufficiente👎)-non ha l\'always on display, inizialmente la trovavo una grave mancanza ma basta tappare 2 volte lo schermo e si vedono ora, data e notifiche, poi lo sblocco biometrico è veloce e reattivo.Inoltre spero che questa assenza migliori la resistenza all\'usura per l\'hardware.Contro-per l\'assenza dell\'adattatore il listino iniziale era troppo alto, si poteva stare sotto i 300 euro abbondantemente anche i miglioramenti non epocali non giustificano un listino alto.Ora il prezzo è medio, accettabile per le prestazioni ma non ""particolarmente stimolante"".Comunque condivido la scelta di non includere l\'alimentatore tanto le case ne sono piene o cuffiette, spesso spazzatura.-il vassoio ora non permette l\'installazione contemporanea di 2 sim e una micro SD.I vecchi erano full optional.Si dovrebbe tornare al vassoio vecchio, grande e full capability.Vulnerabilità all\'usura ed obsolescenza programmata:-il type c sarebbe bello sostituirlo con un connettore magnetico, immune all\'usura ma servirebbe uno standard unico europeo... magari un concorso tra le varie marche.-batteria interna, sostituibile solo in laboratorio, operazione non semplice.-aspetto positivo Samsung offre un discreto piano di aggiornamenti, superiore in durata ad altre marche.Osservazioni extra per Samsung:In famiglia abbiamo quasi tutto con Samsung (cellulari: da 4 generazioni, una decina circa, frigo, TV, forno...) ci siamo trovati abbastanza bene ma si può migliorare:-un tablet era difettoso, si spegneva da solo.-il tv ogni tanto non risponde ai comandi e bisogna spegnerlo a cavo, lo fa 2/3 volte all\'anno.-l\'a31 dopo circa 2 anni è completamente fritto, va in crash inspiegabilmente spesso ed è dovuto andare in laboratorio in passato perché la memoria si intasava di dati non esistenti (forse il colpevole era telegram ma non era sicuro, risolto in laboratorio).-sul forno di casa nuovo, le scritte di funzionamento delle manopole sono venute via dalla semplice pulizia, andavano messe sotto una copertura di vetro trasparente come sui cellulari-sul frigo nuovo (funziona molto bene e non crea ghiaccio 👍) si è rotto il balconcino trasparente, di plastica abbastanza fragile....problemi che variano tra il leggero e il grave comunque in generale prodotti buoni con prezzi medi che però lasciano ampi margini di miglioramento per il controllo qualità, la progettazione e l\'aumento della costanza produttiva.Consiglierei a Samsung di acquisire i vecchi modelli usurati e studiarli per capire come migliorarli, in robustezza e affidabilità.Immagino che un colosso produttivo del genere fatichi a stare dietro a tutti i prodotti ma bisogna progettarli per durare nel tempo e considerando tutte le situazioni avverse possibili.Comunque Samsung resta la marca preferita in famiglia e con una discreta assistenza, in tutti i settori, migliorabile con un aumento di organico e risorse in Italia.Conclusione per A33:Su due A33 ne siamo rimasti soddisfatti, è uno smartphone prestazionale che copre ottimamente tutte le nostre necessità.Miglioramenti tangibili in vari aspetti anche se sconsiglio di cambiare cellulare se si hanno vecchi modelli ancora in buono stato, tra a31 / m31 e a33 il salto evolutivo è contenuto, hanno prestazioni similari nella vita normale / non professionale.Spero che durino nel tempo, almeno tre anni minimo, senza problemi hardware/software come il mio m31 vecchio.', ""Its actually a very nice

The time within Australia to my home in Queensland was slightly slower, however I received the phone in about a week or so! Credit to Cell Universal, Amazon and UPS!Phone was new and all was in order, good packaging. The fast charger came with circular prongs and a separately supplied US adapter, so I needed to supply my own converter plug for the US adapter. The car cigarette lighter plug was included (as described). Works perfectly fine in Australian (stated provider incompatibility with some US networks (Verizon) not applicable here). Happy to see that this Global version has NFC (for contactless payments), otherwise it would have been a problem. I saw that the \'ask Question\' section to other users has said Yes to NFC, so I took a punt. I had previously ordered a plain ""Redmi 12"" from a domestic EBay seller (not the Note model) which is a much cheaper model (which I was happy with), but had to return it because it didn\'t have NFC (even though the description said \'yes\' for NFC (not related to this seller). If you are not fussed with NFC, then I recommend the ""Redmi 12"" as it\'s much the same otherwise and is around US$150 cheaper. I previously had a Redmi Note 8T phone, but needed to replace it with a bigger memory phone, as I reached the max 64GB memory space.

The phone I was looking at had a price tag up over a thousand bucks and who the hell can afford that these days?

A great display at 6.67 in, 8 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of storage, a great processor and a 120 MHz refresh rate. All this for under $320. There's an old saying that if something sounds too good to be true it usually is! Not in this case!! After setting the phone up and using it a while it is a fantastic device. One of the things I really like about it is the fingerprint reader which is part of the on/off button and is flawless in operation and extremely easy to activate. Much handier than an on-screen button. I understand originally there was some security issues that have been corrected with this phone and many would be a bit wary of the phone's origin.

I was able to easily add my SIM card to it and transfer my Google Fi number to this phone in just a few minutes. (Note, this phone does not support eSIM, so you will need a physical SIM card to set it up.) The setup was also very easy and simple to do and has the same data and app transfer option as on other android devices.Once set up, it was still on Android 12 by default, but I did have a large series of updates that took about an hour to fully get it up to the latest release of Android 13. The phone had approximately 7 updates in this time frame.Software:Once fully updated, OxygenOS was a breath of fresh air. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I was using a version of Android that was more customizable than ever as well as giving the default Android-like experience a whole new form. OxygenOS was cleaner and more modern than any other Android skin I\'ve seen, with a translucent app and notification drawer, subtle icon animations when expanding the quick settings, and so much more. Even the built-in clock has a red color for the ""1"" digits as a subtle nod to OnePlus itself. While the entire skin feels smoother than any Android experience I have ever had, it is also the most customizable. You can change the icons to a number of different shapes, sizes, styles, and colors and the same goes for the software color themes, home page screen transitions, the always on display, and even the battery icon style itself. It\'s an endlessly adjustable software to reflect the style you like the most and I really, really like that. When it comes to ringtones it even has a much higher amount of ringtones I\'ve ever seen preloaded on a phone, and the haptics are out of this world as each ringtone has haptics that respond identically to the tune that is playing. It\'s just that great and I haven\'t even mentioned the side quick app drawer or the shelf features. Also, despite being a physical switch, the phone also has a three-way slider above the power button that can instantly switch your phone between Ring, Haptic, and Silent modes as well as muting your audio automatically. It\'s similar to the silent mode switch on an iPhone but better, in my opinion.Performance:When it comes to performance I was very impressed. Despite the fact that I got the 8GB of RAM model, the phone was snappy and blazing fast. Apps launched in no time and apps scrolled with perfect butter-y action with that 120Hz display. My games were lag free in all that I tried and I am just overall very pleased with the performance.Display:In this phone is an LTPO gen 2 OLED panel that is one of the best I\'ve seen aside from a Samsung phone. Not only is it able to automatically adjust its frame rate to conserve battery life, but it does it in a way that you wouldn\'t otherwise notice. There is no hitching or stuttering or weird glitches from the display shifting its frame rate and it is just a flawless experience. Not only that, the display is incredibly vivid, detailed, and bright and I didn\'t notice any color shifting like on some lower quality OLED panels. The HDR looks great, and the screen is super immersive. You will not be disappointed when playing games or watching content as it is one of the best displays I have seen. However, I am not the biggest fan of the curved edges as I prefer a flat display but the edges of the display are not too troublesome or as curved as some others.Battery Life:At first I was slightly worried that the battery wasn\'t going to be good as despite its exceptionally fast charging speeds, my phone was depleting charge extremely fast the first few days that I had it. In the days since, the battery has held up much better with somedays giving me as much as triple the screen on time compared to when I first got it. I assume that this is from the adaptive battery functionality finally optimizing itself based on how I use my phone and what apps I run, but it is something to take note of as you must give the phone a few days to get this kind of battery life. Presently, I am able to use it all day with about 30% charge left around bedtime. Now, the most standout feature about this phone is its charging capabilities. From a near 0 charge, this phone can almost completely get back to 100% in just 30 minutes which is crazy to me as I am used to phones taking anywhere from 1 hour to 2 hours to fully charge. So, if you just need a quick charge, just plug this in for a few minutes and you\'ll get a couple hours of screen time. It\'s that fast. If you prefer to charge wirelessly, it will also support insanely fast wireless charge speeds, but you have to make sure your wireless charger is capable of putting out the necessary wattage.Speakers:The speakers on this phone are very good. While they don\'t get as loud as I would like, they do deliver fuller and more natural sounding audio compared to other phones I have used. Voices sound crisp and clear, and music sounds detailed and rich. The only disappointment I have with the speaker aside from the volume level is that the bass is not very noticeable, but this isn\'t that much of an issue to me. The speakers deliver what I would describe as a mostly ""flat"" or otherwise balanced sound EQ.Build Quality:This is also without a doubt one of the most comfortable phones I have ever used. Even though I usually put a case on all of my devices, this is probably the only one I would consider using without one. The back of the phone has this unusual but incredibly well done powdered granite-like feel as the frosted matte finish is soft and soothing against the hands. It doesn’t look or feel like glass at all as it feels more like a soft stone, and the best part is this finish doesn’t leave fingerprints of any kind which means you don’t need to constantly wipe it down. It also gives it a slight amount of grip to hold as it isn’t slippery. Despite not being a fan of curved edges, the design of the phone is not too narrow or too wide which allows it to fit almost perfectly in my hands as if it was naturally designed for them. The phone is also very light weight despite all that is packed inside of it, and I just really think the design, feel and weight of the phone is one of the best I have ever used.Camera:We are finally at the weakest part of the entire phone. Despite the Hasselblad partnership, the cameras on this phone just can\'t quite live up to the photos taken on other Android phones such as the Pixel series or Galaxy Ultra phones. It gets even worse when you compare the selfie cameras as the photos taken by this phone are extremely soft and lack detail. While the rear camera can still take some fairly good photos, it is more of a ""luck of the draw"" as sometimes it will capture a good photo and other times it will not. Videos are even worse. While most android phones have never really been that good when it comes to video, there is something noticeably wrong with the videos I record with this phone. It\'s like all the saturation got turned up to a 1000 as the colors are way over done compared to real life in addition to all the shadow details being crushed with nothing but pure black. It\'s still usable to make a quick post, but I would not recommend using it to record videos for content creation. Overall, it is not the worst camera by any means as it is still fairly good, but it just doesn\'t live up to my expectations.Overall, this is an excellent phone that when on sale, I would say is better than almost anything else aside from the camera. At the current sub-500 cost, the performance, battery life, display quality, and software experience is unrivaled. The only thing that hurts the value in my opinion is the camera, but it excels in almost every other category. I highly recommend it.', ""BEFORE I GET INTO THE PROS AND CONS OF THIS PHONE I'LL LAY OUT THE BASICS OF WHAT THIS PHONE PROVIDES RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX WHEN YOU FIRST START USING ITThe phone comes with a 65-w supervuuc charger. It also comes with a screen protector pre-installed but no phone case. It has the SIM card tray key included as well with some nomenclature about the phone as well. I bought the American US version and use AT&t service on it. Other reviews mentioned not being able to use AT&t or 5G but that is all in the past as I have 5G on my AT&t service with this phone and it is very fast and works perfectly. Also some people complain about not being able to use Netflix or some other streaming services but they might have not had the US version as I set up all of my streaming services such as netflix, HBO max, hulu, Amazon prime video etc.Also, the software they use for moving data from your old device to this one was the fastest I've ever moved my storage and data as well as phone settings to another phone ever. They did very well on that.PROS:*CAMERA:  The camera is not bad, pretty good in fact but compared to a Samsung or an iPhone it just barely comes up short. Again it is not bad just not as good as a iPhone or Samsung. No one could ever tell the difference when I send them pictures I've taken with this phone or show them. But they are always curious as to what phone I'm using because it is different.*DESIGN AND BUILD:  Phone has a great design, maybe just because it's different from many other phones? It is very slippery though unfortunately as I wish I didn't have to put a case on it. I do like how the material on the back has a mat granite type of look. And I learned to like the camera bump. The build feels very sturdy and does not feel cheap at all. It has a flagship quality build I would say.*PERFORMANCE:  The phone is very fast though, it operates fairly well with everything I threw at it including the most demanding games you can play on a smartphone. The 120 HZ refresh rate is incredibly smooth and can go from one to 120 HZ based on what you are doing and I have never noticed any hiccups. It always felt zippy and fast.Your RAM increase options with the software are also great. I believe I was able to up my ram just using the software to 19 gigs.*BATTERY:  The battery charges very fast and can hold on to that power pretty well throughout the day and halfway through the next. If you are a heavy user and are constantly playing power demanding phone games you will have to charge it at night most likely. I usually charge it in the morning around 20 to 35% while I brush my teeth and get ready and it's done by the time I'm out of the shower. Pretty much 15 minutes will get you to 80 or 90%, which should definitely last you all day unless you ended up using it very heavy, which also you just need to charge it for a little bit again and you'll have another full day. I was able to Outlast my girlfriend's iPhone 13 Max. She always ends up with a low battery unexpectedly as well as me so it is nice not to have to charge it for an hour and a half to two hours to get a full battery. It takes 25 minutes for a full battery 0% - 100% which is nuts. (Although to get it to charge this fast you do have to enable and disable some settings as far as battery health settings go. They do this for people who are worried about the health of their battery as fast charging could supposedly have a negative impact on the battery's long-term health but I find that is not the case and I've been fast charging phones for a couple years.) Let's face it though, at the end of the day our battery levels are almost always between 20 and 30%, so 15 minutes charge and you are pretty much good to go has been a great perk using this phone. Never worried about having a dead phone or not enough battery before going out. It was about 4:00 p.m. and I didn't charge my phone since the morning from the previous day and when my girlfriend told me we had to meet up some friends for a night out but had to leave pretty much right then, I threw my phone on the charger at 12% for a little over 5 minutes and I had 65%. I used it for GPS, video and photos that night and some tipsy phone calls when we got home and I didn't have to charge it until the next day in the afternoon.*SPEAKERS/ MEDIA CONSUMPTION:  The speakers work on both the top and bottom of the phone and sound great. They will definitely get loud enough and don't ever get raspy or have a tinny sound.*CALL QUALITY/ SERVICE/ HOTSPOT:  The call quality on this phone is extremely good. Both the earpiece when receiving calls as well as making calls worked perfectly as far as sound quality. Anyone who I called said it sounded great all the time. I even called my other phones as I have to numbers and it always sounds incredibly good. Hotspot is also easy to set up and I get service everywhere. This thing can get reception and data as best as your carrier can dish it out. 5G works just fine with my carrier AT&t. I saw some other reviews on here saying these phones will not work with at&t, or the 5G doesn't work but AT&t fixed that and OnePlus is fully operational with AT&t's service.*OS AND SOFTWARE:  Because I am not coming from another one plus phone I can't say it is as good, better or worse than the previous operating systems but I can say that they aren't bad at all. Compared to Samsung though, the customization isn't as great, just a little more limited but nothing nearly as restrained as iPhones iOS. Also Android 13 should be coming out in the next month to a few months on the American versions,  But Android 12 still works perfectly fine.  I haven't set up the face unlock on this as I never use it on any phones, except for the iPhone cuz it forces you to but even then I always end up using a code on the iPhone when face unlock doesn't want to work at night or whatever other lame instance. This has a quick and reliable fingerprint reader which I've always loved on phones and honestly wish they at least kept it as another option rather than taking it away.CONS:*BRIGHTNESS:  The brightness is the main issue I have with this phone. It's not terrible but I also use an iPhone 13, Samsung flip and fold 4 and those get very bright. Again it's not terrible but I always have my brightness up to 100 on all my phones. You can still see it just fine during the daylight so it's really not that big of a deal, brightness is just something I like personally when it comes to phones.To be honest, this phone was incredibly easy to set up, use and work with on a daily basis. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good Android phone and would like something different from what's mostly out there. The main takeaway I got from this phone was having a flagship device and never having to worry about the battery or having to charge the battery.I hope this review helped."", ""I really like this phone. It was perfectly within my budget and had everything I was looking for except for the missing headphone jack but I've noticed most phones don't have one nowadays. Using my phone is a beautiful experience except for one flaw I've noticed and have yet found a way to fix.I sometimes connect my phone to my cars by Bluetooth and I've noticed that the video and audio are always out of sync, there is a delay in the video and the audio is a 2-3 seconds ahead. This is obviously very annoying if you're trying to watch something on your phone with Bluetooth speakers. When I use this feature in my car I'm not paying attention to the video, I only care for the audio so it doesn't bother me too much but this shouldn't happen regardless.Going back to the missing headphone jack, it doesn't have one because you're expected to use Bluetooth headphones or earbuds. I haven't tried to see if I have the same delay I have using the Bluetooth in my car but I wouldn't be surprised if I have the same problem.Other than this everything else is perfect."", 'The Phone is a marvel of technology. Everything that was promised by One Plus’s website. However there were irregularities with the shipped device. It was not properly packed. It came inside an Amazon bubble bag and not in a shipping Box as I was expecting it to be, since it is such a wonderful device. Box was in poor condition. The phone box itself was not taped or sealed, which means that it was used, And I purchased it as a “New” device. The box had glue all over, from the tape removal before shipping. Maybe that is why the price for the device was much less than the advertised price on the manufacturer’s website.Device was on Android 12 and still no “OTA” to Android 13 from One Plus as promised. Also the phone is not “Play Protect Certified”. For the lack of good presentation (by the seller) and those other observations (by One Plus), I do not recommend this seller.As far as One Plus is concerned, I was sadly dissatisfied and disappointed, after so many promises. Amazon should make sure that sellers and Manufacturers comply seriously with what they sell using Amazon services.', ""The OnePlus 10 pro what an excellent phone I wasn't sure at first but now that I have used the phone for about a month I am for sure happy I purchased this excellent phone! My last phone was a OnePlus 7t pro McLaren edition that was an excellent phone. This phone is amazing it has the perfect amount of RAM and storage for me the display is gorgeous. Definitely a great phone and an all-around good buy! I have not had an issue so far! You won't be disappointed!"", ""Phone got delivered very fast and packaged nicely. My old phone was busted pretty bad so when I got this one I was super worried my SIM from Verizon wouldn't work, but I slapped it right in and it worked immediately! As for the phone, OnePlus is one of the BEST phones I've ever used. I used to have an 8 and traded it in. (Which I regret) so I had to go back and get one again, the 10 Pro is very user friendly, and has very good quality cameras. It charges insanely fast and rarely gets hot/overheats. If you're looking for a phone that will last awhile and tired of the Apple and Samsung prices, definitely get a OnePlus."", 'Good hardware for the price. Current version of Oxygen OS not as good as in the past. Fingerprint reader is slow and unreliable. There is no lockscreen message capability. Settings app is unnecessarily different from Android 13 without any corresponding benefit. Hope they get back to basics.', 'Al parecer la batería no estaba en óptimo estado, ya que en un uso regular, nada excesivo tal vez un vídeo, poco uso en redes sociales y el equipo ya había consumido el 50% de la batería.  Llame a servicio al cliente de Amazon y en efecto me comentaron que no era el rendimiento que el equipo ofrece, ya que llegaba a casa al rededor de las 5pm y apenas llegaba con el 20%. Por lo demás el equipo funciona perfecto, la velocidad, la imagen de la pantalla, las fotos y la estética, no hay mal comentario al respecto. Una vez que me hagan el reembolso volveré a adquirir el equipo y espero darle más uso, ya que este solo lo use 10 días aproximadamente.', ""About my use pattern:I use it as a phone, text, and internet device.

Which is amazing as good or better than iphone.The fast charging is really good. Better than Iphone.The camera is as good or better than IphoneThe size and weight is good.The build quality is good.Touch screen works well.Apps available is great. better than Apple.Overall this android is the best one I have used in 15 years.  Currently if I had to get a android phone I would get this.Bad:Not a lot. Most of the bad things are just related to android in general.Not about this phone:I said a lot of stuff is better than Iphone and its true.  I am a Apple person.  IMO in general android doesn't really come close.  Some things it does better sure but its presented in the UI as disjointed.  The UI and workflow need major polish.  Its getting better but a ways off.If you are an android person from a apple guys perspective this is the best you can get.""]"

Here\'s a few things to either reinforce or introduce.Looking at the camera feed in the Ultra Wide mode while in motion/walking around to get shots makes me feel uneasy. Not sick, but it looks so off.It is IP68 rated. Still be cautious though.Get a case and screen protector. As someone who went from a thick rugged phone to this lighter weight but rugged phone, you want extra protection. I still use and abuse the other rugged phone, but I have found out very quickly that it wasn\'t as waterproof as the company claimed it be. (Don\'t get the Ulefone Armor 7, water will get in through the SIM card port even though it has a rubber gasket on it.)Still very strong on the gaming aspect having weird results from game to game. Even with the device up to date on updates, it still plays weird with some or runs smoothly on others. Your mileage will vary.Speakers... Still meh and disappointed about. Invest in wired earbuds (YES, it has a 3.5mm jack) or bluetooth ones.Bluetooth connects flawlessly, for me. No issues with connecting to numerous bluetooth earbuds, speakers, and car audio systems I\'ve tested/daily use.Original:It\'s been since the Samsung Galaxy S5 that I\'ve had a phone with a removable back and battery. Wow!Although it\'s IP68 rated, I\'d still get a case and screen protector for this phone. As you should for most phones.I am very nit picky with phones. Over the past 3 years, I have gone through (either daily driven, tested and returned, or daily driven and broken) 7 Android phones and 1 Apple device (yuck BTW). I can say that I\'m glad to be back with Samsung Galaxy line up, but there could be better options out there for the features I care about - especially the IP68 or IP69K dust and water resistant ratings.For what it\'s worth and in my tests/everyday use, this isn\'t a beefy rugged phone. However, it is an average joe type of rugged phone. (I define ""average joe"" as someone who daily drives this phone, keeps it turned on for months at a time unless they *somehow* install updates in that ""once in a solar eclipse"" moments, plays casual games or even as far as Pokemon Go, charges their phone without a care in the world, and rarely drops their phone but still want that sense of security it\'s not going to shatter on them if they drop it)Pros:+IP68 Rating. I love me a water resistant phone that I can take to the pool with me or get a bit wet in the rain.+Removable battery. I miss it. I still love it. If it happens to get a bit wet, do a unsafe shutdown by removing the battery. Put the phone in some moisture absorbing material or apparatus and check on it in 12-24hrs. (Not rice because the broken rice grains can get into spots it shouldn\'t)+Dual SIM and still have the microSD card? Yes please! Look... most phones have the dual SIM trays with one of the SIMs being a microSD card/SIM slot. Once you put a microSD card in, you only have 1 SIM slot. I hated that. But with this, you can have both SIM slots taken and still have the ability to put in a microSD card! (Nano SIMs are accepted on both SIM slots)+Speaking of Dual SIMs... Verizon and AT&T only, but it\'s great. I hate T-Mobile anyways. Verizon, minus their customer service and online registration, has been great. So when a phone has full Verizon capability, I\'m in.+Cameras are decent. I like it, but I\'ve had better phone cameras. Main cameras (25MP main, f/1.7, 26mm (wide), PDAF and 8MP wide, f/2.2, 123˚ (ultrawide), 1/4.0"", 1.12µm) are ok. I wouldn\'t use the 8MP wide for anything other than Panoramic photos. Selfie camera (13MP, f/2.0, (wide), 1/3.1"", 1.12µm) is good. I still look ugly, so there\'s that.Cons:-Playing games can be challenging. Some games like Shop Titans lag while Pokemon Go can run smoothly. Not sure why. Could be the ARM Mali-G72 MP3 GPU - which is integrated into the Exynos 9611 CPU. I\'ve seen mixed reviews on the Exynos 9611 CPU. So your mileage can vary.-Single loudspeaker that isn\'t loud enough. I find myself having to put the phone closer to my ear, if I were to put my phone on speaker while I talk to someone. For music, it sounds more mono than a single speaker stereo output. Very disappointing.-Android 11... I am ok with it, but I hate it at the same time. It\'s got dark mode, which is nice. But Secure Folder isn\'t the best idea for locking apps. Android 9 had it better where you can lock apps with a code or password without having to sign into your profiles again. But it is easier to access your apps via the app drawer, unlike Android 10.-1 too many buttons for the same functions. There are 2 function keys, along with your fingerprint/lock button and 2 volume control buttons. The top key, which in default turned on your flashlight with 1 press. And the left side key, which turned on Bixby by default. I\'ve gotten used to a phone where their function key was customizable for screenshots, without having to press the traditional Volume Down + Lock Button. So, it\'s disappointing that such function isn\'t accessible on the function keys. You can change the function keys to other actions like turning on and off a Flashlight, or launching your Settings, or anything app based. So you\'re not stuck with the defaults of Bixby and flashlight only.-Speaking of Bixby... I\'m not a fan. I\'m not a fan of Google Assistant either. But I would rather use Google and Bixby. I\'m not sure if they\'ll upgrade to Samsung Sam at this point.', ""I hung on to my S5 Active for 9 years, because nothing else had a usable replaceable battery.  Then the price on the XCover Pro came down to something reasonable.  My only complaint.  Does not have voice answer like my old phone.  I had to get used to using the steering wheel button in the truck to answer calls.  If I'm in the older car with no phone interface, the call has to go to voice mail, I'm not going to mess around with a phone while driving."", 'I bought this phone for many of the reasons B. Rodgers cited in his thorough review. The phone is bigger and much heavier than what I expected [ UPDATE: but I got used to the bigger size and weight].Flagship phones are designed for obsolescence and cost twice as much. They have sealed-in batteries that typically fail after 2 years, and usually only promise 1-2 years of security updates. Since the Xcover Pro has Android 10 from the factory, it reportedly can support more thorough or lasting updates than Android 9 phones. The Xcover Pro guarantees 3-4 years of security updates, and has a 24-month warranty, whereas most phones offer only 12 month warranties and maybe 1 OS update.The battery can be swapped out before a new work shift, and swapped out at the end of its useful life, using only our bare hands. This phone is rugged, water resistant, and has good cameras; other phones with removable batteries have no water-resistance, low-end processors, and low-end cameras. I don\'t want to contribute to electronic waste, so I chose a phone that is designed to last. The ultra-wide-angle camera seems to cover about 135 degrees, so you can stand in a room corner and fit the whole room into the frame.It has a left-side button that can be assigned to any two apps via a long press or short press, and a top button that can be assigned to launch any two apps. The right-side power button can also be assigned, and I don\'t have to lift the phone off the desk to use the fingerprint reader that is built into the right-side power button.* Dictation without the cloudThis phone can convert speech to text internally, without sending your voice to the cloud. I confirmed this by dictating text into apps while holding the right-side button, even when I had the phone in airplane mode.* Wi-Fi callingI need Wi-Fi calling so I can place and receive calls without paying exorbitant roaming fees when I travel, while using my regular phone number. Although Samsung reassured me that all their phones including this one support WI-Fi calling, after purchase Samsung support told me that Wi-Fi calling requires cell-carrier bloatware baked into the phone\'s firmware. Consequently, if you want this phone to have Wi-Fi calling, the only option is to get a carrier version. In the US it is only Verizon, so you will have to put up with the worst customer service I have experienced in years, or purchase the phone from Verizon then use it on another network.* Point Of Sale (POS) transactions:Samsung claims that this is the only phone with EMV Level-1 compatibility: ""You can now accept payments without the need for additional hardware. The Galaxy XCover Pro has EMV Level-1 that makes it mPOS-ready."" However, the Xcover Pro does NOT have MST (Magnetic Secure Transfer) hardware, and therefore does not support Samsung Pay for paying at point of sale (POS) locations.Samsung claims I can use Google Pay, but I have not tried that, as I do not want Google to log every transaction I make with my phone. Unlike other payment systems, Samsung Pay uses MST hardware on their most popular phones to make credit card transactions compatible with all POS magnetic strip readers.The phone does have NFC payment, which works only on POS systems that support NFC. So Ironically, the XCover Pro has more capabilities for accepting payments from other credit cards, but fewer capabilities for making payments with your own credit card due to lack of MST hardware.This unlocked Xcover Pro has powered down for no apparent reason, and self-reset numerous times. I don\'t know if that\'s due to any of my installed apps, though they were working fine on my older & slower Samsung phone. I\'m returning this phone and trying my luck with the Verizon version because Wi-Fi calling is essential to me. The Verizon XCover Pro is not self-resetting, but I have not yet allowed it to install the latest OS update, so I don\'t know if that will cause the resets.*** UPDATE on 2020-07-25: ***I purchased the $500 Verizon XCover Pro with a $200 discount to be credited monthly over 24 months, and an additional $200 credit on my first Verizon bill for porting my phone number to a Verizon Enterprise account. Obtaining a new account from Verizon was so aggravating I\'m not sure it will be worth the savings.1) As far as I know my Verizon XCover Pro has not self-reset. I\'ve had it for almost two months. I suppose I should restart the phone.2) If anyone has conclusively been able to get this unlocked XCover Pro to work with Wi-Fi calling, please reply to this review and let us know. Samsung told me Wi-Fi calling is not possible on an unlocked phone.3) If you have been able to get this phone at a discount from Verizon on a personal account, let us know.4)  Unsurprisingly, Verizon\'s custom bloatware on the Verizon version of the XCover Pro disabled the built-in FM radio. Carriers do this to push us into their data plan. So no emergency radio reception for when the towers are down or out of reach, and no radio feed without a data plan on the Verizon version.5) The FM radio on this unlocked phone was not disabled. However, I could not get FM radio reception using  the NextRadio app (all I heard was noise) even though reception was great on my nearby Android tablet using the same wired earphones as an antenna. Does the FM radio work on your XCover Pro? You you can install the NextRadio app and use wired earphones as an antenna.', 'Yada yada yada, this phone, that phone, all kinds of phones everywhere you turn - you get so bombarded with cell phone ads and commercials it becomes obnoxious. What sold me on this phone is the incredibly easy to remove / replace battery which you just can\'t find much of anymore. All of these new phones do not particularly serviceable batteries, so what happens after a 1000 charge cycles? If you want to keep a phone for years to come, this is it. When they say BEAST, it truly is in everyway. While it is not a slim small phone that you could forget in your pants pocket and accidentally end up in the washing machine, it is not overbearingly large or heavy. This IS definitely a commercial heavy duty grade phone. I put what I considered to be an enormous 256gb micro SD card in it, so along with the 60GB it already has built into it, it now has more space available in it than my laptop PC does. Yes, there are no particular instructions that come with this phone, but it is truly rather intuitive to learn to use. Battery life has been amazing. Reception has been amazing, even in the metal building I work in that is usually dicey for reception at best under any carrier. There is such a dramatic leap in technology with this phone that I am actually stunned - Android 10 is very well done. It is not listed as 5G, but I wouldn\'t be one bit surprised if it gets a software update at some point and magically meets the new mark. As it is, it downloads things and plays HD videos so quickly and smoothly that I wouldn\'t likely even be able to tell the difference if it switched to 5G.So I receive the phone, a little anxious about whether I can just swap in my Verizon SIM card out of my old phone and go. Ooops... Apparently SIM cards got smaller when I wasn\'t looking - DOH! NANO SIM cards now? Ok, so I have apparently been living under a rock. My older SIM was too big to fit. I hopped online and researched it, and what do you know, you can actually see a ton of online tutorials as to how to simply trim your older / larger SIM card down to the new NANO size - interesting. I ordered a new replacement NANO SIM from Verizon at no charge, but it will take a few days to get here. Anxious to try this bad boy phone out, I nervously trimmed my SIM card down with scissors, sanded the plastic side down a bit, and popped it right in. Not sure if I had possibly wrecked the SIM card, and also not sure if Verizon would accept the phone without a fight, I powered it up, went through the initial on screen set up prompts, and BAM - up and running perfectly (standard personal Verizon account - not commercial or prepaid). I transferred all of my data from my old phone to the new phone using the Wondershare Mobile Trans software I have installed on my PC, and everything transferred over perfectly - hooray!Now what they aren\'t advertising much just yet is that this phone has a dual sim card capability - wow. I haven\'t tested it yet, but am going to yank the SIM card out of my wife\'s Verizon phone and pop it into the the slot labeled ""SIM 2"". There was some mention that this feature is coming soon via a software update, but who knows - maybe that day has already come? I am VERY curious to see what it does with two SIM cards in it, speculating that it will act like a ""Line 1 or Line 2"" phone. WAAAAAAAY back in the early days, I had a Sprint phone that ran two lines. I ran a business line and also a personal line on that phone - I sure have missed that capability since then. If this works and I have two lines, I may try one of those companies like Cricket to provide a low cost second line. Again, I haven\'t tested this yet, but I\'ll bet you it works, which will tickle me silly for my business and personal usages.It has only been a few days now, but I am beyond tickled with this phone. I took a bit of a gamble on it, seeing some reviews that ranged from soup to nuts. The outcome? Tickled silly :)  BIG SCREEN, ultra fast processor, more capabilities than I ever imagined (still finding more and more cool features as I continue to use it further), outstanding battery life, incredible HD audio clarity on the phone (bizarre how clear actually), phenomenal camera and video with all kinds of different possible settings, and on and on and on. Rated for being immersed in water up to five feet for thirty minutes??? Military grade drop tested with a Gorilla glass screen?Can you tell how tickled I am with this phone? And to think I was just sold on the fact that you could pop in a spare fresh battery in ten seconds flat - this is an AMAZING SUPER PHONE PEOPLE !!!  I occasionally get something that under promises and over delivers - rare, but it happens. This is most definitely one of the best purchases I have made in years - SERIOUSLY  :)  :)  :)', ""Overall, a very solid phone. I was trying to decide between this and the ($200 more expensive) Cat S62 Pro, so I'll discuss pros and cons compared between the two. Spoiler alert: I finally decided on the CAT S62 Pro.Pros:-- Screen -- The screen on this phone is nice and responsive. It's the nicer of the two, overall. Crisp display, nice colors for the price point, clear letters.-- Battery -- I only used it off and on for a little bit, but the battery life was nice. The battery is actually replacable. That's one of the few phones on the market that does that. I really wanted to like this phone for that very reason.-- Protection -- Overall, the case design was very nice (it's supposed to be a rugged phone after all). I didn't test waterproofness since I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep the phone. The camera was recessed beneath the case cover, the edges around the screen were bossed to provide extra protection. That was actually better than the S62 whose camera wasn't recessed, but was in fact excessed.Personal Preferences:-- UI -- With that being said, the UI on this is a Samsung UI and it's not one that I'm as fond of as the S62 UI due to having come from an S41. It's a personal preference, so no knock against the phone. Basically, the back button and the window carousel button are swapped.-- OS and Preloads -- Oh, the S62 is a stripped down Android with two or three of its own apps. The Samsung has quite a few extra apps. Most of them are quite nice, but I don't need any of them, so they're bloatware to me: Bixby, Samsung App Store, and some other baked in features (e.g. the UI is built by Samsung, not a stock Google one, and Samsung has its accounts baked into the setting pages. The preloads may be a con to you, but it wasn't for me. It runs Android 10, which doesn't have all the new permissions junk that 11 has.-- Call Quality -- In my particular setup, call quality was decent, but not stellar. The S62 beat out the Samsung slightly. It could have been the party I was calling, or a host of other issues, so I didn't factor this into my overall rating.-- Settings -- The settings page wasn't intuitive for me (since it's Samsung's arrangement of the settings page), but I'm also used to a different setup.Cons:-- Camera -- The camera on this has a higher megapixel count, but the S62 actually had better shots with its 12MP camera. So this camera has larger photos with a slightly lower quality.-- Phone Back -- To access the battery, SIM card, and SD card, a cover on the back of the phone must be popped off. This is just a plastic panel, so I'm worried about the durability of the panel over time.Ultimately, I returned the XCover Pro in favor of the CAT S62 Pro, but it was close. The S62 has slightly better IP ratings, and a slightly better camera, oh and the FLIR sensor. In all fairness, as mentioned earlier, the S62 is nearly $200 more, though (which is roughly the cost of the FLIR sensor in it)."", ""I bought this thinking it would be a nice upgrade as I'm a current verizon customer and none of their current offerings have a replaceable battery. This phone is advertised as compatible with verizon network but after 2 new sim cards, and 2 weeks with customer support of both Samsung and verizon, a supervisor from verizons customer support came back and said it's not compatible. So buyer beware, what is compatible is data streaming services. What is not compatible is calling and texting, as the only way to do that is through data streaming. So if you're setup with a phone number through volp and you're not planning to use 4g for calling or txting this is the phone for you.For details of my ordeal:I bought this without a sim card and went to a small wireless shop near me to get a new sim card. First person said, I can't register this sim card with your device, you'll need to contact customer support and have them mail you a new sim card. After calling customer support, they said you have to go to a verizon company store. Went to a verizon company store who did the check on the imei#, installed new sim card but when she tried to make a test phone call, it wouldn't connect. She goes, this phone isn't compatible, sorry, call the manufacturer. I left which was a big mistake because I should've rolled my service back to old phone since everything now authenticates through txt, including email and bank accounts. I wasn't connected to world and an Aunt reported me missing to police. Got resolved, but still stressed her out. Called Samsung and they said, it should work on verizon there's no additional settings needed, it's a network issue, call verizons customer support. So I did and customer support told me when they try to activate it it'll appear for a split second on their screen but doesn't connect. So she rolled back my service to old phone so I'm connected to world again and sent me a new sim card. Plan was to activate new sim card on old phone, and place in new phone. I get new sim card but old phone was too old and no longer compatible. So I called Verizon customer support again and went through 2 reps and a supervisor who finally told me this phone isn't compatible with verizons network.The phone itself is fast and responsive. Great look and still has a replaceable battery. But don't get this if you use cellular networks for calling and texting. Every single rep I talked too, both verizon and Samsung asked to verify compatibility with imei# and it always checked out. If this was to teach people to buy their phones directly from a carrier, f them."", ""I've been going through a lot of phones lately. I live a rugged lifestyle: construction, farming, hunting, camping... I need a phone that can take a tumble or two. The last phone I had like that was a Samsung J7, a strong phone that lasted a long time, but is out dated because it only has 16 gig ROM—towards the end I was switching between apps by uninstalling one and reinstalling the other. This phone has 64, which is plenty for me, since I found the SD slot—the two SIM bays threw me off for a minute, those little things can be tough to see: the SD slot is on top of SIM 1, which is the SIM slot you want to use for the States.Anyway, ever since they started putting the fingerprint scanner under the screen, it seems the screen has become super fragile, and now when you break it, it doesn't just crack and you can still use it, it completely craps out and your phone is now useless. Mind you, every phone I purchase is bought with tempered glass screen protectors at the same time, which is installed immediately upon removing the phone from its packaging, the moment the protective film is removed from the screen a tempered glass screen cover is the next thing to touch it. The last time I didn't have the screen protector when the phone arrived, I left the protective film on the phone and used it like that until the protectors arrived. My old J7 would look a total shattered mess, and I'd peel off the screen protector and it'd look like a bran new phone underneath, and a new protector would be put right back on. I swore by them, but they don't protect the new phones like they did my J7, and I really think it's the stuff they put behind the screen now.This is probably why this phone has the fingerprint scanner on a side button, which I love, because it's way more accurate (probably due to the glass shields), and because it's more accessible: I can reach it with my left middle finger if I'm holding it in my left hand, or with my right thumb if I'm holding it in my right. The on screen readers often took me two hands to operate, this one I can easily work with one, making this phone so much easier for me to get into.Also, I love the two added programmable buttons, a great feature to have for people who frequently wear gloves, you can program these buttons for easy access to things like your phone dialer or camera, even if your phone is still locked, if you choose that option.Android 10 is incredibly customizable and full of features, and this is a standard Samsung phone in that it gives you full access to these features and runs the operating system well. I told you I've broken a lot of phones lately, some phones I can compare this to are the Samsung A20 and A51, and moto z4. The A20 had a power port failure on like day two, the rest were all broken screens. Those phones I think are designed more for office type workers or those in medical field and such, I think. They have a nice sleek design and their screens go to the edge of the phone or even wrap around. This phone's screen doesn't go to the edge, and is slightly recessed, which makes me feel it's better protected from a fall on its face. This makes the screen protector fit flush in the recess, but I'm disappointed that it does not fit snug. That's a separate review for the screen protector, I don't fault the phone for that. This phone is a little bit bulkier (thicker) and I suppose heavier than those sleeker designs, but I'm more comfortable with it in my hands and it definitely feels sturdier.I loved removing the cover and seeing the battery! I've missed being able to change batteries when I go on a long trip into the woods for a campout, and want to take photos or use Google Earth, or track a hike... I hope to be able to purchase a backup soon.It would be nice to have a phone again that outlasts it's specs. If this phone holds up for me as well as the J7 did, I'll be happy. If not, I will update my review."", 'I love my LG G5 so much I bought more than 15 of it for my family and relatives, and 1 as a back up for myself, but unfortunately both died... one wouldn\'t turn on again one day and the other takes too much effort to repair. I have been eyeing this phone from Samsung since May 2020, but the only reason why I did not get it sooner was because the spare battery was nowhere to be found in the states. WTH Samsung? I was ready to upgrade the whole family to this phone, but you\'ve let us down - you\'ve let a lot of folks down.So why then the 5 stars? Read on....Going from the LG G5 to this phone was smooth. Only a few things that bothered me. So lets go over the cons first:- No spare battery available in th US. Enough said.- Volume is lower than any other phone I\'ve used. I\'ve disabled the volume limiter, but the volume on max settings for this phone including for its loudspeaker is still too low. For a phone marketed for industrial use, the audio quality should atleast be up to par with other phones. Microphone is clear and crisp, but what good is it if you can\'t really hear the other person on the line while being in an industrial environment? Regular users should be okay with the volume.- The fingerprint reader/power button is on the right near the volume buttons and is flushed with the side making hard to feel for  whereas the G5 has it slightly raised and it is the only button on the back...so it was easier to feel for. Would really rather have the ""XCover"" button as the power/fingerprint button.- Default button and screen page layout for this phone is messy and frustrating to navigate. It will require some fiddling to get a better end result. Can be much easier to use than the G5. My suggestion...download a button remapper app. It will make your life much easier. Let\'s just hope Samsung doesn\'t decide to disable the 3rd party button remapper as their button remapper is extremely limited, junk.- No IR blaster. Who uses it these days? I do, and quite often. Really miss this option...but then again...it\'s just me.Pros:- Long battery life. I use my phone heavily... to give you an idea...I go through at least 3 to 4 G5 batteries a day. With this phone from morning until night ...I still have about 20% left to go. This is the reason why I am not knocking off a star for the spare battery issue - there\'s  really no need to change battery. However, like all batteries, their charge cycles diminishes, and also because there will be time when I am out for days without a charger. Therefore, I still would like to see Samsung live up to its promises.- Feels good on the hand. Feels solid... not slipper...no fingerprints all over the phone. Looks clean - all the time.- Top button by default is a flashlight on/off. You can change the settings to even have it accessible even when the phone is locked. This is definitely one of my favorite feature for this phone. Ofcourse you can also remap it to other things too if you so choose. Same with the left ""Xcover"" button.- Removable battery and is waterproof? As long as you dont drop it deep into a lake...I was already sold on the removable battery.- Better cameras. The cameras setup is similar to what you get with the G5: Main camera, wide camera, and selfie...just better quality.- Charges quickly. For a battery this size...it completes its charge almost at the same time as the LG G5.Other things to consider:- May be on the heavier side. I don\'t mind this at all, but it is heavier than the G5. Just something you might want to note.Conclusion: it is an upgrade from the LG G5. And for the price, it definitely deserves a 4.5 five star rating. However, I can\'t give half a star, so I\'ll give it a 5 star and hope that Samsung will finally make available the spare battery plus charging cradle.', 'First off, this phone felt great in my hand, which only made the rest of my experience that much harder to accept. My whole family is on a T-Mobile plan. T-Mobile is also one of the most accessible providers in the US when it comes to BYOD (bring your own device) phones, and every ""unlocked"" phone I\'ve ever had worked with their network, except this one. Data works fine over the 4G network but it\'s when you go to make a call that things get crappy. As soon as you dial out or the phone starts to ring for an incoming call, it switches over to 3G and you get all the quality of a 20 year old technology. T-Mobile was super helpful and bumped me to higher tier tech support immediately, but soon tracked the problem down to this model not being compliant with their VoLTE system, which is because Samsung didn\'t make the phone compatible with the T-Mobile network. No option of getting a network update exists from T-Mobile, because they\'re not the ones writing that code, Samsung is.Samsung\'s tech support was an embarrassing testimony to a behemoth in the cell phone world. Their business tech agent (this phone is part of their business line of devices) had almost no information in her system about this issue. In fact, the IMEI number showed up as being locked to Verizon while the phone\'s own  model number, software, and box all indicated it was an unlocked version. All the poor lady could do was recommend I go back to T-Mobile and ask them to make it work. T-Mobile also has a page where you can check to see if your device is compatible with BYOD, and entering the IMEI on that page immediately returns the message that the Xcover Pro is NOT compatible. All-in-all, the experience left me with a nasty taste for Samsung in my mouth. I sold my old phone the day before the new one arrived, but because of the incompatibility I ended up without a phone for three days, which in this day and age is horrible when you run a business and need to make and take calls, navigate to customers, and deal with emails on the run. The phone seemed great, but the experience was awful.The moral of the story is that Samsung is presenting this phone both here on Amazon as well as on their own website as an unlocked phone, which it is not - at least in the generally accepted meaning of that word. It may be unlocked from Verizon, but it\'s not compatible with a lot of other carriers. A customer shouldn\'t have to actually buy the phone to test it out or check it for compatibility (you need an IMEI number in most cases to do this). This information should be clearly presented by Samsung, and it\'s their failure that it\'s not. Shame on them!Edit to add: A lot of other reviews here mention problems with Wi-Fi calling, but I wonder whether some of the posters are confusing that with VoLTE which is like Wi-Fi calling but over the provider\'s data network. I personally did not have issues with Wi-Fi calling. It connected to my home network just fine and when connected, it used that connection for inbound and outbound calls (the LTE signal bars disappear when you\'re on a Wi-Fi network). It\'s the VoLTE part of the equation that\'s the issue with this phone on some carriers. It simply isn\'t capable of using many of the data networks for voice calls, which almost any other modern phone can do.', ""A quick summary to start: The phone itself is 4 stars. The lying about shipping and being available is a 1 star, thus the 3 star average (rounded up).I have this phone and have had it for years. The phone overall was great.Pros:- Durable (gets dropped a lot, even from height). It is in a case, but even so it has been dropped out of the case a couple times. I would say some of the falls it has had would've shattered any other phone.- The replacement battery is nice for when out-and-about and don't have an additional power bank on me. The extra battery is smaller than a power bank and easier to have on me.- The fingerprint reader is quick and responsive.- The speed and responsiveness overall is good. It even handles running multiple apps at a time well (either split screen or window in window).- Works good in the rain and with gloves.Cons:- Screen is barely visible in the daylight. Sometimes even in shady areas it is faint.- It is considered a business phone, so trying to get one through Verizon (or AT&T) is difficult to say the least.I had purchased this one as I finally dropped my current xCover Pro one time too many. It still works, but there is a loose connection now on the inside for the display and requires a clamp to keep the screen on. If the clamp is not in the exact place, it will not properly respond to any input. It cannot be fixed by the typical iFixIt shops because it is the 'active' version of the phone and there is no access (at least that is what the people at the iFixIt shops told me). I figured the price was right for a replacement and It stated I could get it the next day with Prime, so even better.So I order this one 2 days ago and it said it would be here yesterday. Then yesterday it said it would be today. Now it is saying Friday?!?!? Don't state that I can get something tomorrow or the next day if it is going to take 5+ days to get here (if not delayed even more). That is a cheap bait-and-switch tactic. Unfortunately I cannot cancel this order for some reason until after Friday, which means I am also out the money to get another replacement phone.Again, I would still recommend this phone to be used in rugged environments. As with any phone though, you should still use a case and screen protector. Rugged is only so rugged after all. I would not buy the phone from here unless your phone isn't currently broken and you don't need a quick replacement. If you can wait a week (or more) then sure, go ahead and order from here. This listing should not say that it can arrive next day as it does currently.""]"

I get 5g speeds almost everywhere and I have it provides a very smooth experience. I also love the AMOLED screen. The contrast I get when watching HDR content is amazing. This is the second device I own that has an OLED screen and I'm never buying another device without one again. It's something you have to experience to understand. No other display technology I've seen is able to provide such inky blacks. I've had no issues with camera quality either. And the price is really worth it. I got it when it was around $280 and it was worth every penny"", ""I came to this when my pixel 5A broke. I hadn't even paid it off! I wasn't ready to drop another $450 on a phone and I found this on offer at $300.For that price it's a decent phone. Way better than any of the real budget stuff like motoG. It beats my old pixel 5A in every way apart from the camera. It doesn't overheat like the pixel either. This alone is why I won't buy another pixel.The camera on this, particularly in low light is poor. At a concert it was massively overexposed by the lights.Otherwise the speed is good, the screen nice and the battery life good.I was worried by the Samsung bloat Ware software on it but it was very easy to make it look plain vanilla Android just using the settings on the phone.The only thing that really sucked was the Samsung keyboard. Just download Gboard to fix that."", ""* Special Edit * Many if not all recent Samsung phones no longer come with the usb wall  charger. You will not get it in the box.Coming from an A7 2017 model, this phone is incrementally great. Its not a huge difference but the main issue today is really OS and security updates end thus forcing a new phone. Because of using Samsung SmartTags, I likely cannot use a custom rom. If it wasn't for that, the A7 2017 really isn't that far from this. That's something I can now test.The A53 has a surprisingly better speaker. Really loud and sounds like it's coming from the front instead of the bottom where it is. Actually, seems they also use the call speaker as well to output sound which is on the top.The camera is a bit better of course. It's good enough. I'm no camera snob or you better be buying the most expensive phones if you ask me. Has macro function. Also does a good job focusing.The fingerprint reader is about the same once enabling it to always show on the always on display (AOD) and I set AOD to always show as well.The screen is good. There's no wild difference other than marketing.Battery seems about the same in limited testing (my A7 still gets about 48 hours with AOD enabled and some use). The battery saving special modes can add up to days of battery life mostly on standby. So in theory up to 7 days. The A7 has this feature and its great for no power emergencies. Looks like a bit differently implemented on the A53 but still have to properly test it. I know for a fact that Android devices can last up to 12 days on standard batteries as I have one that does. A much bigger screen, etc at 7 days standby is wonderful. My numbers for sleep drainage show it might even make it without the battery saver.But, the A53 battery will take some weeks or months to properly see how the battery does. Interesting, point AOD here has no auto off (and on) while down or in a pocket which is crazy. That instantly saves battery and is crazy they no longer have it. Instead they have schedule so you can at least get a partial worse effect of it at night when sleeping or tap to show, etc. The A7 thus gets me only total 3-4% drain at night even with AOD enabled. So far, the A53 with AOD always enabled sees 3% for 7 hours overnight. Looks like 4% per 8 hours. This is for my setup. Your's may differ.Actually,  one of the best improvements appears to be the cellular connection. It appears to be 2-3 bars stronger than the A7. Since the A7 was typically at 1 bar for me, it would often not receive calls, delayed messages, etc. So far,  I'm receiving everything. This was a main issue I always had with the A7. Easily exceeding everything else the phone offers.By the way, I'm using the A7 wall charger here.  It's 15 watts. That's fine. The A53 just charges 10 watts slower than the maximum. I see no need for now to spend more for that. It just charges a bit slower. As I edited in earlier, don't expect Samsung include them now with their phones. The A53 does not come with one for anyone who thinks it does. Neither does their more expensive models this year.So far not seeing any issues. I'm happy with it.  But, there's far too many features anymore. Takes a lot of time. I'd still be almost as happy though with the A7 if it wasn't trashed by the phone manufacturers like they are. But, if you need a phone, this one is a great choice. I highly doubt that will change here. You also get up to 4 years OS upgrades and 5 years security which increases the value of this phone over many manufacturers.Bug: AOD stuck at full brightness in the dark thus consuming more battery. SOLVED: The eye comfort shield (what they call the software blue screen filter for night time that makes the screen yellowish) causes AOD to have problems dimming when both are running."", ""For my needs and just wanting something solid for videos and pictures but nothing overly crazy, plus great performance on the hardware, I think this does well enough and will be utilized just enough for how I use a smartphone. Remember, it's always about what and how you plan to use it more than what it offers, no reason to go overboard without your own solid reasoning on longevity, or a particularly extremely desired feature."", ""Update- I have now had this phone for over a month.  A little distressed to see it has already dropped $100, but that is my fault for jumping the gun.My previous phones were a Nord 10 and a Moto G 5G phone (which I still have).  Also a Samsung A52s, which I had for just a few days before sending it back to Amazon.Here's the deal.  The Samsung A52s 5g had a Geekbench 5 score of 721, vs. this new Samsung A53.  The qualcomm processor on the A52s 5g is noticeably faster than this Exynos chip and I can tell that as well in operation.  There's always a little pause, before something happens after touch the screen with this A53.Compared to the Nord 10 and Moto G 5g, though, this phone this phone has faster test numbers.Screen Brightness and battery life is what I wanted in my newest phone!  Didn't get it!  The 5000ma battery does not last any longer than that of the Nord 10, the Moto G 5g or the A52s that I had.Size in this case, does not make a difference.  By the end of the day, I'm still down to 20% or less.  My previous Moto G Power 4g phones would run easily three days, with their 5000ma batteries.  What gives?  Screen brightness is still a problem.  In bright outside light, I still can't see the screen on this phone either, without shading it with my hand.Lastly, the lack of a headphone jack, although I knew it upfront, did turn out to be a problem.  I usually carry around some Panasonic earbuds.  When at an airshow recently, I popped them into my ears, to reduce the noise.  Then remembered, that I couldn't connect them to the phone.Now the good things- 1) I did speed test, near a collection of 5g towers.  My previous Moto G 5g and my Nord 10, while running on T-mobiles network, never achieved more than 58 megabits of download speed.  Which means their tuners could only handle the lower and possible the middle 5g spectrum.  fyi-there are basically 3 group of frequencies (think-low, middle, high).This Samsung A53 achieved more than 300 megabits of speed next to the same set of towers.  That's almost 6 times the download speed of my other 5g phones.  Which means it can tune into the higher spectrum frequencies.2) The microSD expansion slot is a little weird.  The sim goes on one side, then you flip it over to insert the microSD card.  But it handles my 400 mb microSD card and transfer rate s to it are quick.3) It seems sturdy, I've dropped it a time on two within the house.  However, I had it encased in a Spigen, my favorite brand, of cellphone case.My basic opinion, is to give it 4 out of 5.  Mainly because of the lukewarm battery life, sluggish initial touch screen response, underperforming exynos processor and screen not being bright enough against the sun.But the speed of the cellular download, the expansion slot, the screen clarity, the toughness of the phone, make me give it 4 out of 5.  It's dropped $100 in less than 45 days.  That's a bummer."", ""The camera is brilliant if you know how to use it properlyProcessor is more than enough for day to day activities. Occasional slowdowns can usually be fixed by a quick performance refresh built into Samsung's settingsSoftware is wonderful as always! Samsung's promise of 5 years of support is very generous. I'm able to run the latest version of one UI with no slowdowns and plenty of widgets and customizations.Multitasking is a breeze, too.Sound quality from the speakers is surprisingly loud and clear.The only thingAnd the ONLY thing that I don't like about this is the Exynos chip. Yes, it's great for a lot, but I really wish Samsung didn't try to push it on this model. I really wish they went with an upgraded Snapdragon chip like the A52s.Overall, the phone is perfect for almost everything."", ""This phone does not work wirelessly with my 2018 Subaru Forester. I can hear the callers but they can't hear me. This is a Samsung problem that can only be fixed with a different phone. I guess that is 23rdcheaper than a new car. This sucks as otherwise this phone is great.Update 8-2023 The last software update fixed the problem with the Bluetooth connection to my phone and car. This fixed the only issue I had with the phone."", 'This is my first Samsung phone since the S4, my last phone being a Pixel 4a.  The reason for moving from the 4a was lack of 5G, which for T-Mobile customers who camp or live in remote locations is very important due to the incredible range of T-Mobile 5G.  Both this phone and the Pixel 4a are running Android 12, but this phone has Samsung\'s version.  Surprisingly I don\'t find that as annoying as their S4 version back in the day, and it does have some nice features such as being able to lock the home screen layout to prevent items moving, and the ability to preserve battery life both by turning off fast charging and limit charging to 85%.  The main downside is there are apps I would rather not have, mainly Samsung apps, but that\'s a minor point given the storage available.  The size of the A53 is larger than the Pixel 4a, which is not something I was looking for or wanted, and what results in my ""almost perfect"" title above.This is a dual sim model or single sim, single memory card model.  That corrects one of the deficiencies that kept me from buying Samsung again years ago--the lack of expanded memory.The fingerprint scanner is under the front glass.  It seems to work well, but I\'m still getting the hang of learning where to press--that isn\'t obvious until you try to press in the wrong location, at which time the display will show you.  Being under glass has the advantage of the FP scanner not getting dirty--a problem I had with the Pixel 4a.  I\'m not finding being on the front rather than rear to be a big deal.This is may be my first ever non-Snapdragon Android phone, or at least the first in a long time.  I find it very responsive, but the efficiency is yet to be determined due to a lot of daily use just setting up the phone and signing into apps, etc.  But three days in it appears I\'ll only need to be charging the phone every 2 or 3 days, depending on whether I have the phone limit charging to 85%.There are a few things missing.  No headphone jack, something I never used once on the Pixel 4a and something missing from a lot of phones.  Also it ships with a USB-C cable but no charging brick--not a big deal, and also something becoming more common.Finally, like the 4a, this A53 is made in Vietnam.  I consider that an advantage over made in China for [pick one of many reasons].  Also, Samsung\'s security update policy is very good, reportedly going 5 years from the March release, which was the reason I didn\'t look for other 5G midrange phones more the size of the Pixel 4a.', ""Overall, this is a great Samsung phone that offers a smooth user experience.Pros:- It's fast.- The screen resolution and refresh rate are excellent.- Smooth experience streaming videos. Great sound quality.- Fingerprint sensor works very well.- Battery life is great - easily lasts more than a day (I usually charge it every 2-3 days).- Excellent storage capacity.- Takes clear and sharp photos and videos.- Great phone call quality.- Love the fact that it will receive 5 years of security updates, which is very important these days.Cons:- As with ALL Samsung smartphones, there is A LOT of proprietary bloatware (I previously owned a Pixel and iPhone, both of which contained very little bloatware). I was able to uninstall a few bloatware apps and disable others. For the apps I couldn't disable, I denied them the ability to run in the background and restricted battery access, which helps to extend the daily battery life for up to 2-3 days. They can also be hidden from sight.- I found it annoying that Samsung has its own redundant app store to Google Play and has proprietary apps that ask the user to create a Samsung account. Seems unnecessary when the phone runs on Google's Android system.- No travel adapter included. Seller got the description wrong about what's included in the box. - No wireless charging, but not a big deal for me.Overall, this is a great phone for the value despite the bloatware. For users unaccustomed to Samsung, if you spend some time customizing the permissions and notifications for the bloatware apps, you'll likely enjoy using the phone, too.10/11/2022 Update:- Phone continues to work well for my average user needs, e.g, talk, text, web surfing, streaming, reading ebooks/newspapers/magazines, using Google Pay/Maps/Drive/Docs/Sheets/Notes and other productivity apps, taking pictures, etc.- Battery life continues to be excellent, as I've ensured that most apps (other than the communication apps) do not use background data and have restricted battery access. If you don't make those adjustments, they would drain any big battery quickly.- I like the default Device Care app that helps to further optimize the battery life and puts to sleep apps that haven't been used in a while.- Taking screen-prints is not straightforward, as I had to research online on how to do so. There's no app/icon for it. I have to push the Down button and Power button (located on the same side) simultaneously to print the screen. Not the most convenient.- I can't opine on the dual sim or SD memory card features, as I don't use them."", ""The two most appealing features of the phone are the specifications and the Samsung software update policy. This mid-ranger has many features that match flagship phones. The screen is top-notch, the cameras are excellent, and Samsung's software update policy is the best of any Android phone company. The biggest disappointment is the bloatware that is installed on Samsung phones. The Samsung apps either duplicate Google apps or are useless. I have tried to delete or disable as many as I can, but most are still installed and may be running in the background taking space and possibly reducing battery life. The huge number of Samsung phone models for sale all over the world makes it difficult to issue timely software updates. Android 13 updates have been rolling out for over 2 months, yet my phone has not received it. I should receive a security update every month, but my latest was the December update installed on 12/13. It is now 2/7.Updated on 4/8. I received the Android 13 update together with the January security update. I have not yet received the February or March updates. The Samsung software skin should have been updated from version 5.0 to 5.1 together with the February security update. Has anyone else had this problem? Samsung has a very mixed record with software updates. The bloatware has become increasingly irritating for me.april 29 update. I finally received the April 2023 security update today together with the Samsung skin update to 5.1. No security updates for February or March 2023 were ever received. Please take Samsung's policy of monthly security updates for 5 years with a grain of salt.""]"

Zuverlässig....preiswert...und es muss ja nicht immer Samsung sein dachte ich mir....Was immer kaum zum Tragen kommt aber Xiaomi hat bei seinem Betriebssystems ..was fast identisch ist zu Android ....immer die Möglichkeit ein Zweitprofil zu installieren...was nicht zu erkennen ist von seinem Partner/Kind etc.  Mann kann also sein Handy offen rumliegen lassen....und nur mit einer speziellen Freigabe seine ""anderen"" Tools, Accounts diskret benutzen.... sehr praktisch... übrigens ebenfalls bei den Xiaomi Tabletts', 'La premessa é che questo é un ottimo telefono sotto ogni punto di vista (usabilità e peso, schermo, batteria, connettività, prestazioni nell\'uso quotidiano e in gaming non scalda praticamente mai).Scade un po\' nelle foto e video nonostante la fotocamera sia spacciata per ""professionale"", ma OK non fa dire ""wow mammamia che foto!"" ma per uno smartphone tra i 200 e i 300 euro direi che siamo ai vertici della categoria. Comunque con una buona luce si ottengono buonissimi risultati.Non ha il 5GNon fatevi ingannare dal marketing perché a Roma, tanto per dire, il 5G ha prestazioni mediamente inferiori al 4G+ a meno che non sei in alcuni quartieri privilegiati e rimani assolutamente immobile mentre usi lo smartphone. Attenzione perché in realtà stiamo parlando solo di Speed Test perché nell\'uso quotidiano davvero non c\'è nessun servizio che funzioni meglio in 5G che in 4G, al massimo un video partirà -forse?- un mezzo secondo prima in 5G, ma stiamo parlando solo di questo e non é neanche detto che ve ne accorgiate. Nel 2022 ancora non c\'è nessuna differenza apprezzabile tra uno smartphone in 5G e uno in 4G e/o in 4G+.Qualità/prezzoProprio perché non partono 80-100€ per l\'installazione del modem 5G il costo di questo telefono é spalmato sullo schermo OLED (che si fa apprezzare tantissimo soprattutto all\'aperto in estate), sulla batteria che dura fino al giorno successivo, sulla connettività e il comparto audio. Manca la ricarica a 65W del PRO ma vi assicuro che anche a 33W é velocissimo, e comunque con una batteria da 5000mA non vi servirà ricaricare così spesso come forse pensate.InterfacciaMolto matura MIUI 13 anche se rimane qualche piccolo bug, come ad esempio il fatto che se posi il telefono sulla scrivania l\'interfaccia si mette in orizzontale. Non lo fa proprio sempre ma perché deve farlo non si sa. I difetti riscontrati sono solo poche e piccole cose che notiamo noi maniaci, ma per il resto l\'interfaccia é completo, chiaro e gradevole e non manca nulla. MIUI copia molto da iOS a dire il vero ma va bene così, avete già tutto quello che serve, installare le vostre app preferite e via!.ConclusioniScontato durante il Prime Day é un telefono che va acquistato senza pensarci su due volte, durerà almeno  2-3 anni se non di più e comincerà a farsi vecchio solo quando, un giorno, in Italia passeremo tutti al 5G (ma molto probabilmente per quel giorno avrete già un altro telefono perché siamo ancora a caro amico).Consigliato? Certamente sìMi sento di consigliarlo a chiunque non debba leggere la scritta 5G per sentirsi realizzato, per il resto é un buon telefono in generale e, nel 2022, a questo prezzo ha molto senso davvero. Se poi avete già uno smartphone di fascia alta e semplicemente state cercando un telefono secondario allora smettete di leggere e compratelo subito. Se poi volete proprio il 5G con 100 euro in più c\'è note 11 s 5G (amen).Se arriva in una lingua diversa dall\'italiano?Fate attenzione perché a me é arrivato in spagnolo e di un colore diverso rispetto alla descrizione, anche se il modello era quello acquistato e con i suoi 6/128 come da ordine. In tal caso decidete voi se restituirlo o completare un setup minimale in spagnolo o in inglese e poi cambiare lingua dopo la prima installazione. Alla fine il risultato non cambia perché dopo lo sbattimento iniziale il telefono sarà tutto perfettamente in italiano.Spero di essere stato utile, buoni acquisti', 'Ottimo prodotto perfettamente funzionante, confezione integra , ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo , spedizione veloce.', 'Comprei faz um tempo e o celular é perfeito, veio bem embalado e chegou no prazo certo, recomendo a loja e o produto. 🥰❤️', 'Eu sou apaixonado pelo xiaomi ele é top é tudo de bom melhor ainda chega antes do prazo o preço ótimo tudo de bom super recomendo', 'Good job and good smartphone.', 'Câmera excelente', 'Chegou super rápido, comprei pra da de presente, a pessoa que ganhou amou o aparelho, já possuo um Aparelho da xiaomi e realmete a qualidade e custo benefício são excelentes.', 'Smartphone Intermediário Bom para uso diário.

This phone is good too!, but if I\'d paid  the launch price of over £300 then I would have been disappointed as functionally it is no better than cheaper models and there is certainly no wow factor to the phone. I paid a lot less than launch price so it\'s fine, and the build appears good as expected from Motorola.Four points:- The speaker is loudish but not the best.- The brightness at max isn\'t that bright.- The phone charges quickly with the supplied cable. And battery keeps its power once you have updated and run for a few days, it does eat battery when use it, but if it\'s just on its good.- Even on full screen it only displays to 151mm in length, so although the screen is bigger (166mm) it doesn\'t use it all and the 6.5"" is the diagonal measurement of display (roughly). It doesn\'t display upto the edges like some screens do, it\'s like a smaller screen surrounded by a big frame.If you don\'t need a great phone, because like me I want it rugged as I\'m working and walking outside  then it\'s a good buy.I\'m still putting a screen protector and silicon case on it for even better protection.Last thing, it looks like an ordinary phone (not a rugged phone and handles like an ordinary phone.

Foi-me indicado esse aparelho. Então comprei ele em abril desse ano. Esperei até hj (09/07) para fazer uma avaliação correta.Sou apaixonada por fotografia e, no entanto, não posso afirmar que estou ""deslumbrada"".Coloquei algumas fotos para avaliarem a qualidade da foto, não da câmera. Digo isso porque todas essas fotos tiveram que passar pelo Snapseed (com exceção da última - vou falar sobre ela depois). Na antepenúltima e penúltima foto utilizei o modo PRO, onde configurei de maneira a captar o movimento da água. Essa modalidade só funciona com muita luminosidade e, principalmente, paciência. Em resumo, se você procura um celular que tira fotos legais, mas que vão precisar de retoque, então é esse.A câmera frontal possui um defeito na programação, você não consegue dar zoom. Mas tira uma boa foto.A câmera macro não serve pra nada. Mais fácil você dar zoom e tirar a foto de algo que quer de perto.A câmera principal, quando é um dia muito ensolarado e azul, tem uma tendência de saturar demais a foto depois de pronta. Fica exagerada, então voce acaba utilizando o Snapseed para diminuir a intensidade, senão fica parecendo forçado. Além disso, ela não consegue captar a foto no exato momento que você clica no botão, o que faz borrar a imagem quando há qualquer movimento, a exemplo disso, a última foto. Coisa estranha.Os vídeos diurnos são muito bons quando você utiliza a escolha certa. Contudo, se você quer gravar algo de noite, o flash simplesmente estraga tudo. Fica embaçado (coloquei um vídeo para verem).O que eu achei bom é que o celular não trava. Configurei para ligar a câmera com dois clicks no botão de bloqueio de tela. É super rápido para abrir. Não me deixou na mão.Existe um aplicativo leitor de PDF já instalado que não é compatível com o celular. Quando abre algo, aparecem linhas horizontais em toda tela. Me assustei no início, mas daí troquei de leitor e a imagem vem nítida.Acho que é isso. Se eu lembrar de algo volto aqui 🤣', 'Antes de comprar o celular eu assisti vários reviews dele para ter certeza que era isso mesmo.Infelizmente quando comprei, não tinha mais a cor preta. O vendedor entrou em contato e perguntou se poderia enviar outra cor, e como eu não ligo muito, pois uso capinha, aceitei a troca.Veio tudo conforme no anuncio e o celular foi entregue super rápido, bem antes do prazo!Estou avaliando só agora pois estou há quase um mês já com ele e pude testar bastante coisas.Ele carrega em 15 minutos, as vezes até menos! Bateria para o meu tipo de uso (mais redes sociais etc) dura cerca de um dia e meio.A câmera e o som são perfeitos, ótima qualidade!Quem ainda está em dúvida, eu super recomendo este celular.', 'Después de mucho buscar y evaluar modelos finalmente me decidí por el 11T Pro de Xiomi, ya que no estaba dispuesto a pagar el doble por otro modelo que hace exactamente lo mismo con el Whatsapp. Es decir, si eres un usuario práctico que utiliza las aplicaciones comunes (que no demandan tanto procesador), esperas que tome buenas fotos y la pantalla se vea bien, entonces no tienes que gastar tanto. Qué me decidió a comprar éste modelo y cómo lo evalúo después de unos días de uso:- Procesador: inmejorable (por el precio), es un Snapdragon 888 que temía se calentara de acuerdo a pruebas que había leído; no estaba dispuesto a comprar un equipo con otro tipo de procesador pues en realidad no se equiparan en el rendimiento por un poco más de dinero. Le he instalado un analizador de CPU y sus 8 núcleos no han tenido que hacer un real esfuerzo con la carga de trabajo promedio- Memoria: Cuenta con 8 GB y puede expandirlos a 12 tomando 3 del almacén interno y es de alta velocidad. Puedo decir que la velocidad de respuesta contra mi anterior teléfono es muy notable. El que sea expandible me garantiza que aplicaciones futuras que demanden mucha memoria no representarán un problema- Pantalla: Simplemente hermosa, súper nítida y libre de ""flickering""; después de todo es de AMOLED de 120Hz. Aunque en tamaño es más grande de lo que hubiera querido, hoy en día casi todas son del mismo tamaño- Cuerpo del teléfono: Hay otras opciones de similar precio pero son cuerpo y tapa de plástico, y no estaba dispuesto a pagarlo cuando existe éste modelo con cuerpo de aluminio. El color a contralúz es muy bonito- Batería: De gran capacidad y con recarga ultra-rápida, bastan unos cuántos minutos para obtener la mitad y el 100% en menos de media hora. La batería demora tranquilamente 2 díasLO NEGATIVO (y por eso no le doy 5 estrellas):- Fue enviado en una caja de Amazon sin protección, por lo que la caja del teléfono se maltrató un poco por venir chocando con las paredes internas. Siempre he visto que Amazon exagera en poner relleno pero ésta vez me sorprendieron por su ausencia total- El cargador. Es inmenso, y además requiere adaptador para contacto tipo americano que NO viene incluido; afortunadamente tenía uno de mi anterior teléfono. Es un poco problemático que el cargador se quede pegado al contacto en la pared pues con el adaptador más el peso y tamaño del cargador, inevitablemente queda colgado.- No trae conector para plug de audio. Aunque es lo esperado hoy en día en todos los equipos modernos, Xiomi antes incluía el adaptador que se conectaba al puerto USB-C. Algo más que tomaré de mi teléfono anterior- Lector de huella. Es un gran inconveniente que lo traiga en el botón de encendido pues eso lo hace muy delgado; registrar la huella completa requiere de poner el dedo varias veces y obliga a sólo utilizar dedos de la mano derecha. Los zurdos encontrarán que el único dedo conveniente para registrar es el índice El equipo incluye una funda de silicón que para mí es más que suficiente y estoy seguro que no buscaré comprar otra. El volumen del equipo es bastante bueno para utilizar con altavoz y se actualiza a Android 12 e interfaz MIUI 13. Lo único que me queda desear es que en alguna nueva versión incluyan los gestos para controlar el audio (avance, retroceso, pausa) con la pantalla apagada. El teléfono se siente de calidad, tiene buen peso a pesar de su gran batería, bien distribuido. No se arrepentirán.', 'Não tenho reclamações, já estou com ele em mãos a 10 meses, ótima câmera traseira, gravando 4k, excelente velocidade de processamento, clicou, abriu, carrega super rápido, 0 a 100% em menos de 20 minutos talvez até menos', 'O celular é muito robusto em qualidade. Só uma obs, tive a impressão que ele descarrega um pouco rápido.', 'Muito satisfeita com o produto.', 'Muy buen producto', 'Chegou na data certa. Muito fácil de mexer, não tive problema algum com o vendedor, a única ressalva é o carregador, que é internacional, mas não atrapalhou muito, é só usar o adaptador.', 'Ótimo celular!

Ich kann die negativen Kritiken zu diesem Sensor absolut nicht nachvollziehen.

Die Haptik ist angenehm, das Display superklar und auch bei starker Sonneneinstrahlung sehr gut ablesbar. Die Kamera macht gute Schnappschüsse bei entsprechendem Licht, was im Allgemeinen für alle Kameras gilt. Die Makrokamera ist gut, die Videos sind für ein Smartphone der Preisklasse entsprechend okay. Die Telefonie-Sprachqualität, für mich das entscheidende Kaufkriterium, ist sehr gut! Sehr gute und klare Verständigung fast ohne Rauschen! Das Display ist knackscharf, die Farben nach Geschmack einstellbar. Lobenswert ist auch: kaum überflüssige Bloatware wie bei vielen anderen Marken. Die wenigen installierten Moto-Apps sind entweder lösch- oder deaktivierbar, ein klares Plus. In der Preisklasse nicht selbstverständlich und für mich wichtig ist die NFC-Funktion, die z.B. mit der Ausweis-App tadellos und schnell funktioniert. Der große Akku reicht bei mir für drei Tage. Alles in allem von mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung für alle, die ein preiswertes und gutes Smartphone suchen.']"

I got this phone on prime day with 128gb storage and 8gb ram for only $850 bucks!!! I've upgraded to this phone from a A52 4g ($400 dollar 2021 Samsung midrange phone) so thats the reference phone. Here is a list of pros and cons, im going to start with the pros:-This camera is soo good, video is good (not as good as on the iPhone 13 series but definitely more than usable). I really do like the 3x, and 10x optical zoom and although the 100x space zoom is kind of a gimmick its still very cool and pictures are usable in 30x zoom! Macro mode is cool and front camera is also really good.-The screen is nice and bright, it's big and sharp and although some people don't really like curved screens I don't really mind it that much. Also the Adaptable 1hz-120hz is a game changer and depending on your usage it can actually help you save battery life!-The S-Pen functionality is great, it sits on the bottom left of the phone. It now has a nice matte finish which makes it move less in your hands and allows you to be more precise. But its not as colorful as before. The way the S-Pen feels and functions makes me want to use it more for things like photos, videos, screenshots, and writing since the latency is 2.8 milliseconds which is barley noticeable and if you don't want to use it just put it away since it's part of the phone.-The charging is pretty fast (goes up to 45w) I use the 25w fast charger and can get this phone to 100% in around an hour. For wireless charging it charges at 15w max and for reverse wireless charging or powershare (surprised Apple hasn't introduced this feature yet) it charges other devices at 5w which may seem little but the way I think it's intended to be used or the way I use it is to charge accessories like my watch and buds to last me the day.-The speakers are good and loud. It's a dual speaker set-up with the top one being the earpiece and other one being on the bottom left of the phone. The only thing I dont like about them is the placement of the bottom speaker because when you turn your phone over to the left (most people do and it's so the camera is on the top left of the phone in landscape rather than the bottom right) your right hand either cups or covers the bottom facing speaker. Another pro is that both speakers have those little white foam ball's in them which makes them sound louder without losing detail which is good.-The build quality on this phone is A+ it feels so nice in the hands and the curves make it pretty good to hold. The corners are sharp but a case should do just fine. And the back glass is so nice and it feels great, it also doesn't leave fingerprints!-The Design is subjective so this is all my opinion and I would say that I like it. Although the no camera bump is wierd since I'm used to the camera bumps and I really liked the one on the S21 Ultra this is better because it's just one thing less sticking out the back of the phone. It also makes the slim cases for this phone even slimmer since they don't have to compensate for the camera bump. One think to note is that since now it's just separate cameras sticking out there is less protection because there is no more metal housing around them and the camera gets pretty dusty around the lenses so you just have to pay a bit more attention but still imo a better design.-The color is again Subjective and I got it in green and im going to tell you guys, this is the color to get if you don't want Burgundy. I think this color is better but the top 2 most popular colors is this one and that one. Another thing is that while you can see the pictures of this phone which I've taken on the A52 4g the picture doesn't do it justice, this green is epic! It's like the green that the iPhone 13 series has but to me it looks like a aquamarine color (blue green) with a little more green into it so in some lightning it can look a bit blue but it would mostly look more green. Great color though!Now here we go to the downsides which is only one: The battery life (Sorry for the rant in advance)-The only downside in my opinion to this phone is the battery life, this phone with a 5,000mlh battery allows me to only get about 4 to 5 hrs of SOT out of the box??? Come on Samsung, for $1,199 this battery is unacceptable. The iPhone 13 pro max gets up to 9 hours of SOT for $100 less and with a faster processor. I really hope that a future update comes that drastically fixes the battery because this is not it. I did watch a few dozen videos that give tips on what settings to turn on/off to give me the best battery life without  losing things like a QHD+ 120hz screen or turning on battery saver because I paid for it so I should be able to experience this phone at its fullest potential and I've been able to get this phone up to a solid 7 hours of SOT which is definitely an improvement but Samsung we shouldn't need to be doing this for $1,199. I gave it 4 stars instead of 3 because otherwise this phone is Awesome and I was able to increase the battery life about 2 to 3 hours more without sacrificing things like screen resolution and refresh rate or processor speed.I do plan of keeping this phone because other than the battery, it's great in every other category. I also got it for a steal and with how good Samsungs trade in credit is I'm going to take good care of it until the S23 ultra comes out (Hopefully with a battery improvement) and ill trade in this phone to get that one for about $200 bucks. I love Samsung and am in the Samsung ecosystem pretty deep (galaxy watch 4 44mm in green and galaxy buds2 pro in black) but there are just some things that I can't tolerate but hopefully they see what the problem is (most likely is some software problem) and they fix it by giving this phone a software update or make a hardware change on the next phone that comes out. I do appreciate the 4 years of OS updates I really do but there is no way I can use a phone for 4 years that has a mediocre battery experience. But so far this phone is great in every other way and I'll update when things change and if the battery life gets better. But so far it's a easy 8/10 for me, good work Samsung!Tldr: Phone rating: (Compared to iPhone and other Andrioid flagship phones + my subjective opinion)-Camera: A+ Tier-Screen: S Tier-S-Pen: A+ Tier (compared to the ones before on the Note series)-Charging: A Tier-Speakers: A+ Tier-Build Quality: S Tier-Design: A+ (Subjective)-Color: A+ (Subjective)-Battery: B- (Goes to B+ if you optimize the phone enough)"", 'SAMSUNG Galaxy A13 5G Cell Phone, Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 64GB, Triple Lens Camera, Infinity Display Screen, Long Battery Life, Expandable Storage, US Version, Black...and my thoughts.I love this phone a lot. It replaces my Moto G Play 2021 which was a great phone until it stopped working at precisely a year after purchase. I am with Cricket Wireless at present and the last 3 phones I have purchase through them did teh same thing. Stop at one year. The only reason I purchased from them was because, for example, I could get this very Samsung Galaxy A13 5G phone with my service discount for only $169.99. Not bad! Not good, either, because I figured it was crap having been made just for Cricket and has their logo designed on the back. Nopesies! Not again. (Also, I did not have the money for a good phone) And, obviously, it works with Cricket. Immediately.Now, about this phone I bought from Amazon. I love it! But already said that, so, here\'s why!It seamlessly transferred absolutely everything from my old Moto on the sim using its own tech and the Switch app, or whatever it is called, all but about 7 apps that I just had to download and then recognized me for the distinct human I am, a man with skills and abilities you have never even heard of. I got most of those through osmosis by allowing Xrpcok the alien who lives in my walls, continue to do so. You\'d love him! Nevertheless, it was all ready in under 5 minutes with no help from me, although I did tap teh screen when needed, so, that is power!What I do not like about this phone is that it is not scratch-n-sniff technology, like Xrpcok\'s communication device and that it does not recognize my face well. I believe that ""someone"" changed the settings while I was in the Koi pond bathing, but I have no proof. But it won\'t recognize my face and that\'s a shame because it is a pretty dandy face. The other phones I have had did not seem to recognize my face, either, but that was during my peanut butter and honey phase and that delightful and selective concoction was everywhere. The phone, my hair, my BBQ apron, my artist\'s bib, the noise machines...I have 13, the cooler, well, everywhere...and I mean everywhere! So, No face recognition here, but that is likely just on me.It has Android 12 now, still has 39 GB left after the tons f things I put on it, I use a lot of business and art as, and runs as fast as you would hope! And being able to load up to 1TB on this bad boy (I only use that expression this time to tell you to stop using it because it is not fair to small boys at all and its usage has to stop!) is great!I won\'t mention all the features that are already listed in the product page because I am pretty sure you know how to read and if you read reviews, it is after reading about the product on its page and this is just your research. I did extensive research before buying this phone, more so than ever. Because I don\'t have the money for a new phone like this...and yes, everyone knows this is a budget phone, but an awful lot for me.It has all the bells and whistles you need...except for real ones...I love bells, don\'t you? The can be tiny or gigantic beasts high in a tower. I have not been in any towers lately because I have a fear of heights. But I could be coaxed up into one by cotton candy. So, start planning. Oh, and you would probably love bringing this phone up there, too, to take phenomenal shots on...no, not the landscape and views, but my petrified face and glee combined, thanks to the cotton candy. And this phone would probably capture every crystal in it! Great camera and one of the reasons I wanted this. I need a good one for my art. This does that beautifully! No great art editing included but you can download that for free. But it does have great additions in teh phone in the camera and photos similar to my Galaxy Tab S7, which was a great surprise.Mine has no rocker button for volume but two separate up and down buttons. That concerned me because NONE of teh photos I saw anywhere at all had three buttons on teh side, only two. I contacted Samsung directly, gave them all the info they needed and then downloaded an app called Samsung Tutor (I think) and they got into my phone and checked everything. Everything. They told me I had the latest version that had two separate volume buttons that made the selections much easier...and confirmed my phone was perfectly valid in every way! Fantastic! I could hear some clanking in the background on the call and got exceptionally hungry and invited my tutor to luncheon. He sadly declined and I went to Walmart to find someone who would. Barbra was there, as always, so we had Honey Buns in the parking lot. I would have preferred Marcus the stocker, but Babs in cosmetics said I am pretty.Oh, I forgot where I was. Reviewing this phone. Well, it is extremely fast, holds the charge well even under heavy use, the colors are fantastic, the images perfect, the sound in only one bottom speaker is very loud and sounds absolutely wonderful, even more so using the headphone jack, and everything else about this phone, and I am extremely picky, is great! I feel like I bought a more expensive phone and it, in a small way, reminds me of my tablet!I could care less about its plastic or somewhat bland shell build, I have a great case and protector and were it any heavier, I\'d think it was a device that Xrpcok slipped in to control me when he\'s back inside the walls. But, maybe it is because my case is quite techy-looking, to me. I think you need one for protection. Not personal protection, although, I suppose it could  be used. It is, remember, a really good, powerful phone!There\'s nothing wrong with this phone. It is pretty loaded and wonderful! I know people with the more overpriced Galaxy phones and this one is pretty much just as good and I recommend it! An expensive phone doesn\'t make one any better, just uses up more money they could have used for  things like a cotton candy machine, and they are pricey for the industrial kinds. And that\'s the only kind to have. This phone is priced perfectly and as a pure Galaxy from Samsung, should last for years. I just hope it doesn\'t slide into the Koi pond if I take it outside...Giftable? Absolutely!', 'Edit (7/30/2023): This will be the last update I write about the S20 FE, as I plan on getting a new phone in the near future.After 3 years with this phone, I can\'t say my feelings have changed very much. The only reason I\'m writing this is to warn anyone thinking about getting this as a budget phone at some point in the future. The glue holding the back panel has loosened to the point where it is lifting off the phone. There is no bulging battery, as far as I can tell. The cheap glue that they used to put the S20 FE together is just not holding together anymore. They tout having software/security updates for however many years, but what good is that if the phone falls apart before you get to that point?To anyone reading this in the future: no, this phone isn\'t worth $499 (the price amazon has it as I\'m writing this) new in 2023. The chip is still okay and it has that precious SD slot that phone manufacturers don\'t want to include nowadays so people buy the expensive, higher storage models. If you really, really want one to use as a budget phone, look for a refurbished one. I\'ve found ones being sold for under $150. Who knows? Maybe the phone refurbishers used better glue to put the phone back together.I haven\'t decided which phone to get next. All I know is that it won\'t be a Samsung.Edit (8/18/2021): I\'ve dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.It\'s been a little less than a year, and the issues mentioned above have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time. Okay, maybe not daily use, per se. But enough that it\'s starting to effect my initial thoughts on it.The amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane. Every time I take it out of my pocket, it\'s opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard. And this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things. I turned off double tap to turn on (despite wanting that feature) and turned on accidental touch protection (which did absolutely nothing). I even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time I close it. But it just keeps happening. No software update really fixed the screen, as suspected. This is a pure hardware messup.Here\'s the cold, honest truth: the screen on the S20 FE is terrible. Worse than my old S7. Worse than even a budget android phone\'s screen. It\'s beyond comprehension. The virtual proximity sensor is also worthless. I almost want to give it the classic ""angry Amazon customer 1-star"" review, but I\'ll refrain. There\'s still good here with the chip, customizability, and great battery life, but that stuff can only get you so far.Here\'s my advice: don\'t bother with this phone. You can get a midrange smartphone for the same (or even a lower) price, with better specs. It\'s still not the worst thing out there and I\'m not tossing it in the trash just yet, but it\'s definitely the last Samsung product I\'ll be buying. So disappointing, but I couldn\'t keep this review a 4-star in good conscience.I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons. One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I\'ve done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You\'ll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can\'t beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But, if you\'ve been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I\'d say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn\'t, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it\'s not flagship levels by any stretch. You\'ll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you\'re looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I\'d look elsewhere.From what I\'ve seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There\'s undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I\'m sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven\'t noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that\'s about all I\'ve seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don\'t blame you.It really is a shame that I can\'t give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there\'s always the worry that time will make them worse. It\'s a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I\'m more than happy with it.', ""My last phone was a Samsung A10e, and anyone coming from a cheap A series phone can for sure tell you that this is a MAJOR upgrade. I got the 128gb S21 FE model and I only paid $590 USD for the black version, despite really really wanting the white version, yet that one was priced at $699 USD. Would I pay $699 for it? Probably not, but everyone has a different budget for everything!When I received the phone, it came in its regular factory box which is very thin, like I was concerned for a second that they just sent me a case, but nope! They've cut down on everything that they send you. It came with the phone, a manual in a tiny box, a sim card tool behind that box, and I believe short type c cable, I already have a charging cable so I didn't pay any attention to it. Not that big of a deal really, it just worried me for a second haha.Now I'm someone who worries about storage, and this phone does NOT come with a micro SD card slot (unlike the S20 FE), however I've not had any problems with my storage yet, I still have roughly 61GB out of the 128GB to go. The system itself is 22.5GB which is expected as this is a very beefy and fast machine, and then I play a lot of games so my apps take around 39GB. I don't take many photos either so I only have around 1GB used, but if you are someone who loves to take photos, I recommend getting a separate portable hard drive or even using your personal computer to send your photos over, as spending $70-$130+ for just 128GB of more storage is a lot when you could use that to get around 500GB on a standalone drive. It is also worth mentioning that getting the bigger storage version for this phone, also adds 2GB of ram to it, giving it a speed boost, but I'm about to go over some things about the phone's speed.As for game wise, I play Genshin Impact, Colorful Stage/Project Sekai, Stardew Valley, Pokemon GO, and Fallout Shelter, and this thing runs them all like a BEAST. I wouldn't recommend getting the extra 2GB of ram in the bigger storage model since this phone can run pretty much anything you throw at it. Anyone who's ever played Genshin Impact knows how heavy the game is, and it can run it at max settings just fine, the only problem, is that it gets INCREDIBLY hot. So hot that it lowkey hurts to touch after playing for more than just 5-15 minutes. This could be completely fixed if you get a cooling mount for around $20-30. I do prioritize game functionality and speed over looks so I do play extremely comfortably in low-medium settings as it still looks great! However if you're looking for a gaming machine with smooth fps and no lag at all with maximum settings on heavy games (since bigger temperatures means lowering the processing of your game, causing lag), I'll have to recommend looking for a different phone such as an Iphone or a Oneplus since they do that well.The camera is good for me! I take photos of my dog and that's it. It also has a 30x zoom which is crazy. The front camera is really good and I sometimes put it up to my head and angle it to make myself look like a goldfish and it's super funny haha. The fingerprint reader works extremely well even with a screen protector. Fun fact I found: you can lay your finger over your fingerprint reader while the screen is off and it'll unlock! So you don't even have to double tap your screen to wake it up or press a power button. I was never a fan of 120hz screens and I still am not, but it looks super smooth when I have it turned on. The AMOLED screen was a huge game changer for me, it's beautiful and has incredible contrasting colors. I know people say they have tons of issues with the battery to this device, but I honestly haven't had any problems whatsoever. Now I do keep medium power saving mode on as I just don't see too much to the use of allowing your phone to do any big background services when you're not using it. It lasts about a day and a half. I work 9-5 and I come home with 70% battery after being on it or checking it very often and frequently. Now I will say there has been some connectivity issues during heavy storms and heavy storms only, but I experienced that issue with my last phone so there's a massive chance that's just my mobile data provider (which is US Cellular). By the way, this phone is unlocked, so it should be able to accept just about any other provider you use. I also think it supports 2 sim cards? I'm not too sure as I'm not someone who would ever have to use it, but if you are, then that's a plus.Overall this phone is absolutely amazing and I 11/10 recommend it :)"", 'Tengo prácticamente una semana con el equipo y no me arrepiento de nada, vengo de un galaxy s8+ y el salto es muy bueno, quería un s20+ pero después de tantos videos de análisis que ví me decidí por este s20 fe ya que no le pide nada al plus, solo el tema de que la parte de atrás es de plástico pero seamos sinceros la mayoría lo ocupará con funda así que estarás poco en contacto con esa parte. Voy por partes:Tiene: carga inalámbrica, carga reversible, snapdragon 865, resistente al agua y polvo, 6 de ram, 128 de almacenamiento, tasa de refresco 120, pantalla Amoled, batería 4500 mha, Cargador ""mexicano"" pero de 15w yo te recomiendo que compres uno de 25w cuando hagas tu pedido para que tengas carga súper rápida ya que es lo que admite el teléfono, la entrada es USB c, trae pinchito, admite tarjeta SD, solo un SIM, si se puede usar en México sin problema yo lo ocupo con Telcel sin problema.No tiene: pantalla curva que en mi caso agradezco ya que algunas áreas en las pantallas curvas son difíciles de alcanzar, me pasaba mucho con mi s8+, no trae funda por lo que recomiendo que compres una al mismo tiempo que hagas tu pedido del celular para que cuando te llegue tu equipo puedas usarlo con su funda y estés más seguro 😊. No tiene entrada de audífonos 3.5 por lo que si no tienes audifonos Bluetooth vayas pensando en comprar uno o comprar un adaptador, para mí no es ningún problema ya que los audífonos no los ocupo casi.Envío: me tardo en llegar una semana prácticamente pero todo dentro de los días que me marcó desde el inicio la fecha de llegada, pudo haber llegado antes pero en mi caso DHL no llega directo a mi ciudad si no que hace reconexión, pero todo eso está contemplado en la fecha de llegada así que todo bien. La caja llegó en buenas condiciones y toda sellada nada abierta solo un poquito arrugadita de una esquina pero se entiende por el manejo de la mensajería, nada agrave prácticamente imperceptible.Pago: pague lo que marca el precio en el anuncio, no tuve que pagar nada más ya que parece que los gastos de manejo vienen incluído en el precio anunciado, en México sin ser 5g y sin el procesador snapdragon el teléfono está en unos 16 mil y lo que pague que fueron $13,200 es un súper precio considerando que es 5g y trae el snapdragon.Rendimiento: lo he usado con los 120 hzs y me ha durado todo el día la batería, llegó con un 20% a las 9 pm. Creo que es un rendimiento bueno pero no el mejor considerando que juego prácticamente nada al día, mi mayor uso son las redes sociales, correo y aplicaciones del trabajo pero las ocupo mucho que compensa esa parte del juego así que no creo tengas problema para terminar tu día con algo de batería y si no una cargadita de 20 minutos y listo. El rendimiento ha sido de unas 7.5 horas de pantalla encendida.Cámaras: si considero que venía de un s8+ el salto ha sido muy grande, las cámaras tienen muy buena calidad y nada que envidiar al s20+ si no me crees ve los videos de reseñas y verás que no hay mucha diferencia por lo mucho más que pagas en el plus creo que el FE tiene mejor calidad precio.En resumen es un buen telefono, me gusta mucho el módulo de cámaras, el color que elegí fue el azul y me agradó mucho, se siente como un premium y luce como un premium, yo pensaba en darle una oportunidad a un Xiaomi, realme, poco etc pero seamos sinceros Samsung es Samsung y si trae un snapdragon es mucho mejor, estoy seguro que los Specs suenan fabulosos en otras marcas pero no creo que su calidad de equipo aguante el pasar de los años, yo uso los teléfonos un promedio de 3 años, siempre Samsung y los he dejado prácticamente como nuevos. Así que si quieres un teléfono bueno, bonito y que te dure unos años este es tu opción ideal, no te vas arrepentir.', 'Last update, 12/24/22This will be my last update, as I traded this in for a Google Pixel 7. With the price that I bought it at, and the amount for trade in I received from Google on their Black Friday sale, I couldn\'t pass it up and was basically a wash.This phone never received a monthly security patch. I don\'t know if that is a Samsung, Amazon, or T-Mobile issue (and maybe it is because I had bought the 256GB storage option??), but it is a major one to me. I don\'t know if this phone would have even received One UI 5 (aka, Android 13), and I traded it in before I heard it was released in the US for this model. In my few months with this phone, the best thing about it was the price - both amazon\'s sales price, and Google\'s trade in value. Take that for what you will if you have a use case similar to mine.Update - 9/15/22I have not received any security updates (August should have been out, by now, September was just released, but my phone is still on the July patch the phone shipped with). I am not sure why this is, and unlike a Pixel phone, there is no way to force/sideload a security patch. In the same timeframe, my S20FE did receive the August patch. I am holding off for now and hoping this is a fluke, but if I don\'t receive the September update by October, this may indicate an issue with phone itself.Update - 8/9/22After going caseless for a couple of days - both on wifi almost exclusively one day and on 4G LTE another - the case was likely the issue. Both tests resulted in a warm, not heated phone after heavy usage and over 6 hours of screen on time. The Spigen thin hybrid was the same case I had for my S20FE, except this one was not the ""clear"" option. I am not sure if the hard type of plastic on the back did not displace heat well with this phone model or if something in the non-clear cases are made with a material that interferes with RF signals, but that case was returned and a cheap, all-TPU case was purchased. Screen on time has continued to improve from the barely 5 hours before to 6.5-7 with the same usage now. As such, I have added one star to my review. I still encounter ghost touches and I am not sure how much of an improvement the case change has been to signal strength, but this has gone from an underwhelming experience to a solid option for those that can get a good deal on it.Original review below:I have bought and used both an S20 FE (6 RAM/128 ROM) in 2021 and an S21 FE (8 RAM/256 ROM) on Prime Day in 2022. While the S20 FE ended up being almost the perfect phone for the past year, the S21 FE was not worth it, even at Amazon\'s great price.S21 FE Pros1. Slightly smaller than the S20 FE, and I found it easier to handle - a few millimeters makes a huge difference here.2. Camera was excellent as every other Samsung phone I have owned has been.3. Phone had the July 5th Android update waiting to download when I received the phone in mid July. My S20 FE was about a month behind on monthly patches (probably due to Samsung prioritizing newer phones).4. Solid construction - Like the S20 FE, I have no worries of this getting bent, punctured, or damaged from compression, as I have experienced on some phones. As with just about every other phone I have owned, I have a TPU case on it to prevent fall damage.S21 FE Cons1. Battery life. A little about my settings: after doing all updates, I factory reset the phone to have a ""clean"" install. Downloaded all apps and then turned auto brightness and NFC off, only have bluetooth on when in the car, screen set to 60hz refresh, 5G off, and mostly on fiber-connected WiFi at home. On my S20 FE, this could get me 9 hours on-screen time for one charge easily. The same settings on the S21 FE barely eek out 5 hours with a slightly smaller screen and the same battery size. Not sure if this is a bad android security update (which will prompt an addendum to this review next month) or the phone itself. But underwhelming after 2 weeks of usage.2. Possibly tied to the battery - it seems a lot warmer than my S20 FE ever got when using for long periods of time. Will be using without a case at home to see if that is part of the issue or not.3. Connectivity - I wouldn\'t say there are rampant issues per se, but it does not seem to have the signal strength when using 4G LTE when out and about. Again, the case may be a factor here, and will be using without for a couple days.4. Ghost touches - have had odd things happen with active on display stopping music, or tapping one area of the screen to open an app and something else entirely launches.At this point, this was not worth the upgrade for my use case, and I probably should have just bought another S20 FE instead. My phones get full usage daily, and it is just a matter of time before the S20 FE\'s battery starts to take a hit. However, with the charge I get out of the S21 FE, I probably could have stuck with my current S20 FE for quite some time.', ""The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G phone is easy to set up and outperforms my Galaxy S8+ in all regards. For those of you with Spectrum Mobile service, 'in my experience,' the S21 FE phone works without issue. HOWEVER, do not expect meaningful support from Spectrum. The Spectrum Compatibility Web App reports the S21 FE is incompatible with their network. However, it also reports incompatibility for my wife's Galaxy S21 Ultra and my old S8+, both of which perform well on the Spectrum network. Chatting with customer service yielded the same result: incompatible. However, after switching the SIM card from my S8+ to the S21 FE, about fifteen minutes later, I received an automated email from Spectrum stating I would be enjoying their 5G service within an hour. Less than twenty minutes later, the network recognized my phone's IMEI number and connected it to the network. DISCLAIMER: The foregoing is for informational purposes. It is based solely on my experience. Your experience may vary. I hope this helps. Good luck!"", 'Después de 3 años les recomiendo este producto, uso gaming sin problema y fotos premium de calidad, excelente celular, lastima que se devalúa más rápido pero sin duda en pleno 2023 celular 100% recomendable (ojo solo la versión snapdragon) el exynos cambia totalmente la experiencia', 'I got my S9 after my S4 crapped out after 5 years (screen went off, wasn\'t even cracked).  My S4 & S9 served me very well!  I had the S9 for 4+ years it simply is an amazing phone.  I was at a crowded place, and someone knocked my elbow while holding it.  It fell, and the screen cracked pretty bad (not like one crack, many cracks).  Screen still works perfectly, but, I was scared it could stop working at any time.  So, I needed a new phone.  I looked at the S21 FE and S22.  At the time I purchased, the prices were about $200 different (then a week after I purchased, prices were the same!).  But, I\'m happy with my purchase.  I liked small phones in the past, never had a bigger one.  I am actually enjoying the larger screen.  Better for viewing content.  I\'m a guy and my pants pockets are plenty large for this phone as well.  Feels no different than my previous S9 in my pocket.  I\'ve watched a lot of YouTube reviews of the camera / video quality / test pics and footage, and it seems they are almost the same (sometimes I prefer and think the S21 FE image / video looks better, others the S22 looks better - kind of a toss up).So, what have I noticed?  Well, battery life is amazing!  Beats my S9 by FAR!  Now, my S9 was 4+ years old when I had to replace it (now use the S9 as a ""camera I\'m not worried about losing or breaking"").  I had the S9 for a long time, and I cannot remember how good battery life was when I first got it.  But, I don\'t recall it ever getting worse either.  What I can say is, I used to have to top my S9 up a bit at least once or twice a day.  My S21 FE, lasts ALL DAY (and I even have the battery saver setup so it only charges to 85% - never did that with the S9).  And even from 85%, I get a full day no problem!  Usually around 35% or so when I am ready for bed.  The screen is great.  I do leave on 120hz mode all the time.  I also have dark mode turned on.  I like how it looks, and dark things on screen use less battery than bright white things.  But yes, battery is great.Now the cameras.  My S9 actually had almost identical video.  I make YouTube videos and the S9 did me very well in 4K by 30 or 60.  I do notice the S21 FE is ever so slightly better image.  It also has better stabilization and just some other processing stuff that helps out.  The pictures are better for sure.  I\'ve taken pictures of people and shown them, and they\'ve been like, ""What phone is that?!?  The pictures are sooooo good!""  The S9 did well.  But, the S21 FE is for sure an improvement.  I used to use my G7X Mark ii for most pictures, because it just was better by far than my S9.  Now, I don\'t think I ever really need that camera anymore.  This phone produces awesome photos!I haven\'t had a single issues, no glitches, no nothing.  Just a smooth perfectly working phone.  I did kind of like the S9 having the fingerprint reader on the back.  But, I quickly got used to the in screen reader.  It works fast and great.  Apps load fast.  Camera is on in an instant with a double tap of the power button.  Just really nothing to complain about.

It's  easy to hold without the curved glass . I debated whether to get the ultra or 22+ but what decided it for me was the curved corners of the 22+.  I don't like the sharp corners on the ultra . This + is perfect for me. I updated from 8+ and except for the battery life of this new phone I'm happy with it. I was happy with my 8+ and this 22+ is getting all the new updates and is supported ."", ""Haven't had any issues. So far, so good.Nice battery life.

Smooth OS.Think I'm gonna hang on to it for a while. 😉"", ""Decent battery life and you can stuff all the annoying Samsung apps that you can't uninstall into their own folder.  The fingerprint reader works fine unless you put a screen protector on.  I'm blaming the nature of screen protectors for that and it's possible this latest generation of Gorilla Glass is back to being scratch proof but I'm not inclined to test that at this moment.  Other phones I tried recently were the s20FE, Sony Xperia iii, and the s21 Ultra.  The Sony didn't support T-mo's voice over Wifi and the Ultra was like driving your Vette to the grocery store.  It's powerful and very heavy and very LARGE.  I couldn't one hand my last phone which was on the wide side and after using the Xperia I knew I wanted something slimmer. And that curved screen on the Ultra is useless.  And who has pockets for all that girth? The s22+ is the sweet spot for me in terms of size, plays well with T-mobile (was much cheaper to buy unlocked than from the carrier after a Samsung price drop), has a flat screen, and as an avid photo hobbyist I can't find fault with the photo capabilities.I wish the phone was thinner front to back or had some curve to it but that's about it."", 'Like the phone.

This is a great phone, bit the margin is greatly narrowed without a microSD slot. I will be paying much closer attention to stats now and will change when iPhone gets a little better. A lack of a microSD slot is a HUGE downgrade in the newer Samsung models.', ""I don't upgrade phones very often, but I had to unless I wanted to try rogue OS updates, as the OS version on my S8+ was no longer supported for work apps. Got a good prime day deal (lots of deals if you look around, though, especially through providers).Moving to the new phone was easy using the included cable and the Samsung Smart Switch app.Phone is much faster than my old phone, more built in storage, several app problems resolved, and Android 12 is a big improvement over 9.Fingerprint sensor on the screen has worked really well so far. I've heard that's a problem with some other brands. Placing my thumb on the little fingerprint graphic is much easier than the sensor on the back on the S8+.Happy with the upgrade."", ""Phone is very fast for the apps I use daily, and switching between apps is seemingly instantaneous (compared to the Galaxy A51 I had previously)The battery life has been great for me so far, no complaints there. I have also set the screen to 60Hz so idk if that makes a big difference in battery life or not. I just personally don't need my Amazon app for example to screen refresh higher than 60Hz, now if I were to play Call of Duty or something then yes I would prefer higher refresh rate. I may set the phone back to the adaptive refresh setting (up to 120Hz) just to try it out some more though.This is also my first 5G compatible phone, and I do notice a big difference in app loading times (where network resources are required to load pages) and I'm very happy with it."", 'The audio on the s22 that I purchased is awful. I have purchased several Samsung phones over the years and this phone takes great photos but the audio is defective.', ""I want to start with saying this is my FIRST flagship phone. I've been a Motorola guy for the last 8 years, tbh. I switched because I was tired of buying a new phone every year due to slowed down, clunky OS upgrades. This phone has blown me away on every aspect. The 30x space zoom is super duper cool and I've never seen something like this before. The battery life is my only gripe, coming from Motorola 2 day battery life but eh, it's worth that small sacrifice for so much more. I can do everything in my daily routine and more with absolutely no slowdowns.""]"

Como é bom carregar o celular só uma vez por dia, se você não é uma pessoa que joga nada além de um Candy Crush da vida, coloque o celular no modo de economia de energia e esqueça do carregador, simples assim...

Óbvio que você não vai colocar um Genshin Impact no gráfico máximo e rodar tranquilamente, mas tirando esse fato o sistema não trava, não engasga, responde rápido, você mandou ele abre, você deslizou ele troca sem medo e sem demora.Áudio:- Expectativa 6/10- Realidade 9/10O som estéreo é agradável, limpo e alto o suficiente pra se aproveitar qualquer joguinho e vídeo sem frescura, eu sou quase um audiófilo da vida, som é muito importante pra mim e eu fiquei muito feliz em saber que esse celular suporta todos os novos padrões de áudio bluetooth de qualidade, estou tentado a comprar um fone novo só pra usar com esse celular...

This phone essentially doesn't need to be charged. I only connect it to the charger, maybe once every couple weeks and it doesn't even get to full charge, but that's how ridiculously huge this battery is. There are laptops with smaller batteries than this phone. It literally takes over 15 hours to fully charge this thing from zero with a low-wattage charger, but it also supports 18W charging. It doesn't matter though because this thing will go several days on a 20% charge for me.I had the WP5 before, which was a fine phone, but doesn't pick up a bunch of the cellular channel for T-mobile, so service was awful.This phone does not have that issue. It picks up more 4G channels than many phones you get in the USA. It picks up one 5G channel, which is the most common 5G cannel and works fine if you have coverage. My city doesn't have great 5G coverage, so I just turn that feature off, since it doesn't reliably receive phone calls and text messages if it's constant switching networks. This is not really an issue with the phone.The WP5 had a charger port cover that was extremely difficult for me to remove without using a paper clip or something. This phone has an easier to remove cover for charging, not that you'd need to use it much!This phone is HUGE. Like 4x bigger than a normal phone, and the screen isn't any bigger. So if you want this phone, keep that in mind. It will strain your hand to use it for a long time, but that's the price we pay for the 15000mAh battery.

I can literally go a whole week before I charge it. My only grip about it? There\'s a system app on this phone called ""system manager"" that destroys everything omce your phone goes to sleep. I cannot play any music because as soon as the screen sleeps, music cuts off and every app that was in my cache is removed.

SO disappointing!I discovered after some testing that roughly 30% of the time there\'s no audio alert generated for programmed event reminders, and in 1/4 of those cases, a notification is not generated at all ... no bubble, nothing in the notification bar or history ... nothing!!Then, there\'s the hardware ... should be solid, right? Specs indicated SD card memory expansion up to 128GB, so I obtained and installed a premium 128GB SDXC card but the storage display showed it as 256GB (it\'s definitely not). After about a week of normal usage, the device couldn\'t mount the card, reporting it as ""corrupted"" ... I pulled it, and checked the card in a laptop card reader ... the analysis reported that the phone formatting created a file system with more data blocks than the card actually contained (major no-no)!It\'s been over 3 weeks (as of this writing) since I emailed Plum support (as published on their site) and still haven\'t received a response, so to get back to the headline of this review:If you rely on event reminders or expect support ... don\'t buy this piece of crap!', 'I bought this for my mother who wanted a rugged phone.

E já tem 4 meses de uso.Pesquisei bastante sobre qual celular comprar e me chamou a atenção esse modelo. Paguei 1550 e valeu a pena pelo valor. Veio com capinha transparente antiderrapante. O carregamento realmente é muito rápido, em cerca de 1h30 carrega completamente. Bom processador para jogos simples. Pes, FIFA, UFC, PUBG rodam tranquilamente, sem travar, não testei em jogos mais pesados. A internet 5G também funciona bem. O que deixa a deseja é a bateria que preciso carregar praticamente todo dia, a excessão de finais de semana, quando uso menos. Mas durante a semana, todo dia preciso carrega-lo. O sensor de digital é muito bom! A câmera está dentro do esperado, não tiro muitas fotos, então não busquei por isso quando comprei, mas a câmera é boa para mim. Outras questões que notei nesse tempo, o celular apresenta uma dificuldade no giro automático, por vezes ele cria vontade própria e não gira a tela facilmente, por mais que possua uma opção de ""bloquear orientação"" que serve para não girar a tela, ela não funciona sempre. Outro grande problema são os áudios do whatsapp, só consigo escutar um áudio em sequência. Se a pessoa me manda dois áudios, preciso pausar o segundo áudio, tirar o telefone do ouvido e iniciar o áudio de novo para funcionar. Isso sempre acontece, é um problema do telefone. O microfone também tem problemas e pelo que pesquisei é um problema da Xiaomi em seus smartphones, eles não conseguem arrumar, áudios do whats as vezes tem chiado, ao escutar (não ao gravar), se você pausa e inicia de novo, o chiado para e músicas no Spotify também as vezes ficam com o chiado  que vem e para do nada. No geral era isso, recomendo o produto no geral! Dúvidas, podem me questionar.', 'Bom celular, rápido, resistente', 'Sobre o celular:Não tenho o que reclamar. A bateria tem uma ótima duração, até mesmo jogando jogos como COD, WoT e PUBG. A tela também é boa e tem um ótimo brilho. O carregador é virado na desgraça, o bicho da carga completa em uns 30min a 50min, claro, isso dependendo do nível de bateria. Ele roda COD, Wot e PUBG no talo, porém ainda prefiro jogar com os gráfico no baixo pra não força-lo muito pois ele esquenta muito com os settings no high. A câmera dele é um ponto mais ou menos, eu no caso não ligo muito pra isso e estou satisfeito com ela, Aliás, eu tirei as fotos no RN 8 do meu irmão. Se você que um ótimo custo benéfico, este é o que eu recomendo.Agora sobre o comprador e a dor de cabeça que tive com os correios:No anuncio fala que as taxas de importações estão inclusas, porem eu mesmo tive que pagar a taxa de importação, paguei R$107 ≅ US$21,46.Sobre a dor de cabeça que tive com os correios é que eles enrolaram muito para entregarem, levou 11 dias pra ele vim de Curitiba para fortaleza e mais 3 para vim para minha residência, sendo que já comprei na China varias vezes e eles demoravam 5-6 dias para entregarem.', 'Se lo compré para mi hijo y está encantado, muy buena capacidad de memoria, las fotos geniales, Buena compra', 'Ótimo.']"

Ponto a favor do vendedor e da Amazon. O pacote chegou em boas condições. A embalagem vem lacrada.

Eu fiz isso e o aparelho ficou completamente doido, com textos escritos em chinês na tela. Desliguei, coloquei o chip e tudo funcionou bem.O aparelho veio carregado em 60% de bateria. A transferência de dados do meu celular antigo (BlackBerry KeyOne, Android) para este foi tranquilo. Porém, nesta transferência por backup os aplicativos também são transferidos. Daí houve problema com o funcionamento do BlackBerry Hub (que ainda espero conseguir fazer funcionar com um especialista em TI, pois esse app é muito bom). Quanto aos outros dados (contatos, fotos, documentos, etc.), não houve problemas com o backup, que foi rápido.Particularidades:a) o carregamento total da bateria foi um pouco lento.b) o primeiro uso da bateria demorou 38 horas para descarregar totalmente, muito bom.c) depois de carregar novamente até 100%, fiz uso da ferramenta ""ultra economia de bateria"", ativando esta opção à noite, antes de dormir e deixando até de manhã.

Incríveis as fotos com este segundo app, mas os arquivos ficam enormeas - mas a definição das fotos é impressionante.e) SOM: achei um pouco ""metálico"" demais, embora com excelente volume (alto).f) a qualidade da tela é boa, mas dependendo da luminosidade fica muito escura. Acredito que devo fazer alguns ajustes nas configurações.g) APPS: a Xiaomi inclui vários apps, inclusive um app de ""limpeza"" do celular, o que é ótimo, para não ser necessário ficar usando apps comerciais, que têm muitas propagandas.

Veamos sus pros y sus contrasPros:La batería: Siendo en lo que más destaca este dispositivo, ya que su batería de 5,000 mAh te da bastantes horas de uso (a mi me dió entre 7-9 horas de uso continúo).La pantalla: Algo que me agrado del dispositivo fue su gran pantalla la cuál te da mejor visibilidad.Su almacenamiento: Yo vengo de usar un dispositivo con solo 16 GB de almacenamiento por lo que ahora usar con 64 GB se me hizo un gran avance.Su respuesta táctil: En mi opinión la respuesta táctil del dispositivo es bastante correcta y sirve perfectamente para redes sociales.El procesador: Si bien el procesador no es el mejor si que está bien optimizado, ya que este funciona con juegos como Free Fire, PUBG Mobile y CoD Mobile. Desafortunadamente trate de instalar el Genshin Impact pero a la hora de descargar el contenido el dispositivo se calentó muchísimo por lo que decidí cancelar la descargaBocina: La bocina se escucha de excelente calidad pero su posición si que me incómoda (Se ubica en la parte trasera del dispositivo)Desbloqueo facial y dactilar: Admito que me volví adicto a desbloquear el dispositivo por medio del desbloqueo facial, y aunque el dactilar lo hace de manera correcta me incómoda que este en la parte trasera.La capacidad de usar dos chips: Sinceramente yo no uso esta característica pero va a ver más de uno que le pueda interesar.El precio: Yo conseguí este Realme C21Y por 2,2998 MX y ha 15 meses sin intereses por lo que el precio es bastante bueno por lo que ofrece.Contras:El brillo: Este es muy bajísimo, teniendo que usarlo en un 30-40% en interiores y en exteriores un 80-90 %La cámara: Aquí si que falló Realme, ya que la calidad de la cámara y fotos no es la mejor hablando de la cámara principal pero si hablamos de la frontal esa ya nadie la salva.La respuesta de rotación de pantalla: Esto es algo que si me molesta ya que para rotar la pantalla es necesario que casi pares el celular hacía esa dirección.Bueno, mi conclusión es que si quieres un dispositivo solo para navegar en redes sociales y uno que otro juego nada exigente es un dispositivo que te recomiendo. Pero si lo quieres para jugar juegos como Genshin Impact o para tomar fotos profesionales pues mejor busca en otro lugar.Regreso después de varios meses y tengo un par de cosas que decir.El dispositivo sigue funcionando correctamente y sin ningún problema. Lo que vengó a comentar es sobre el apartado de los juegos, específicamente los emuladores.Lo probé y alcanza a emular 3DS de manera decente. Pasando por GameCube con un rendimiento igual decente tirando a malo. Con Wii es similar y digo que es un milagro que los juegos corran a mínimo 15 FPS.Si lo quieres para emular GameCube para arriba, hay mejores alternativas.Eso es todo lo que quería comentar.', 'Compré este artículo hace más de 2 años para mi papá, el uso es básico, fotografías, redes sociales, youtube y comunicación.Ha sido buena compra por el precio, mi papá es alguien a quien se le cae muchísimo el teléfono y ha aguantado multiples caídas desde hace 2 años.Lo recomiendo ampliamente.', 'not used yet', 'Tiene algunos detalles en cuestión de funciones y a veces se cierra pero pues ya todos los celulares son una basura así que pues está bien', 'This phone was great and sleek. Very sturdy build but unfortunately it did not work with my service AT&T even as advertised.', 'El teléfono es bonito, bastante delgado, aunque pesado.Viene con la capa de personalización de google y con todas sus apps (casi todas son desinstalables)Pros:Para mí la pantalla es lo que más destaca para el precio. 1080p buenos ángulos de visión, una buena relación de aspecto y los bordes ni el notch molestan.La batería llega a durar 2 días de uso casi continuo, hay veces en que la tengo al 20% y sin usar mucho el equipo me puede durar hasta día y medio.Tiene un rendimiento bastante decente, aplicaciones como Snapseed y photoshop las corre sin problema, incluso con varias aplicaciones abiertas. NO LO HE PROBADO CON JUEGOS PESADOS.El micrófono es muy normalito si le subes a la calidad de grabación, ni bueno, ni malo.Contras:La cámara da resultados decentes en condiciones óptimas, pero muchas veces se le nota la falta de enfoque y calidad a la imagen, lo mismo aplica para la cámara frontal.La cámara macro es inútil, se ve horrible.La bocina pese a sonar bastante fuerte, la definición no es la mejor para escuchar música (aunque te acostumbras)', 'Es un teléfono de entrada en todo sentido, hecho para un usuario que no pretende más que chatear y revisar redes sociales. La pantalla no es mala, pero no está como para hacer maratón en una plataforma de streaming, lo mismo por el audio, ya que el altavoz suena bastante fuerte pero algo ""enlatado"". Los materiales de construcción no son para nada premium pero no son realmente malos (el cuerpo es totalmente de plástico). Las cámaras son, quizá, su punto más débil; no tienen una buena calidad (se infiere por el precio). De día puede dar resultados decentes, aunque el fondo sale muy quemado en las selfies. De noche son completamente inservibles, nada para gente exigente. Diría que es un teléfono ""cumplidor"" pero hasta ahí. El único ""pero"" que yo personalmente le pondría es que el puerto de carga sigue siendo micro USB, cuando la mayoría de los teléfonos actuales ofrecen por defecto tipo C.', 'Es un buen aparato. En medida a su precio es uno de los mejores.', 'El teléfono llego rápido y sin contratiempos, llego completamente sellado, lo único que incluye en la caja es teléfono, papelería, cable usb, cargador y llave para bandeja.Estéticamente el teléfono se ve bien, tiene buenos acabados y esta hecho de buenos materiales, en cuanto a rendimiento corre aplicaciones ligeramente demandantes aunque suele calentarse después de un rato de uso.Funciona con cualquier compañía de telefonía en México incluidas OMVs de Altan y se le pueden poner 2 sims de diferentes compañías sin problemas.Los únicos contras que le pondría serian la no inclusión de un cargador tipo c y la calidad de la cámara, si bien las fotos que toma no son malas la calidad si podría mejorar.En conclusión es un buen teléfono, especialmente en relación calidad/precio, solo recomiendo grabar un unboxing al momento de recibirlo como evidencia en caso de recibir algo diferente.', 'La verdad es un buen equipo, no es tipo c, es micro USB, pero es un buen equipo para juegos muy básicos y no tan básicos, soporta memorias de 128 GB y es muy bonito a estética, además tiene lector de huellas , es buen equipo si concideras el precio , yo te invito a adquirirlo conciderando el precio']"

Shooting in night mode is very bright, and shooting video in 4K with the built-in hand stabilizer makes it look like a pro. It didn't come with a music playback app, but I installed the free Pulsar from the google play store.

Too bad.Background: I needed to replace my dual SIM Moto G8. Very few made-for-US unlocked phones have dual SIM capacity, and my second SIM is European, so I usually get phones for the EU or South Asian markets. I also wanted 5g, if possible, and a slightly better camera than I had with the Moto. Overall, I was happy with the Moto-- it was a no-frills workhorse--but they had not updated their dual sim line with anything I wanted. I checked reviews, and decided on the OnePlus Nord. So, this is a phone targeted to South Asia being used in the USA. I've never had a major problem with that before.***Two big problems started from the first day out of the box: it does not hold a charge well, and loses internet connection constantly.I don't play games on my phone, and I rarely watch more than 15 minutes of video a day. I do have a lot of apps, but try to limit what's running in the background. Nevertheless, my phone drains from 100% at 8AM to below 40% by nightfall. I often have to recharge it during the day. This started as soon as I got it, and has only become worse over the 6 weeks it has been in use. The past few phones I had took a couple of years for the battery to become this bad.However, the loss of connectivity is the bigger problem for me. I am on TMobile which is a GSM network so that's not the issue. And TMobile 5G & 4G coverage in Boston, where I live & work, is excellent. I have not had a problem with phones losing data connectivity since the early 2000s, but something about this phone takes me straight back to those days. My job requires me to scan documents on my phone and text or email them often, and to track certain types of news. The internet will work for 5 minutes then will drop without me taking a single step in any direction. It drops when I'm outside, when I'm inside, when I'm standing still, when I'm walking, when it's sunny, when it's raining. My internet connection is so unreliable that I now have to carry my IPad as a backup for work. This is annoying.A third problem is that a few times a week the phone spontaneously shuts down. I don't mean that I accidentally hit the wrong button and it turns off-- I mean, out of nowhere, it just decides to power down. Sometimes it reboots, sometimes it doesn't. It was sitting on my coffee table completely untouched last night and it happened again. Take it as an indication of how trying the other problems are that I don't even consider this one of my top issues.I checked the NordPlus support forums for all of these problems, but have found no useful advice. I'm definitely not the only customer having these issues, and that is especially true for the internet connectivity problem-- complaints from all over the world for dropped internet connections.The reason I'm giving it two stars is that the camera is very good for this price point, as is the sound quality for calls and for podcasts. I have not had any trouble running all my apps, beyond the obvious problems with them becoming non-workable without an internet connection. The physical profile is nice.None of this makes up for the problems. Other phones from OnePlus get good reviews. Maybe this model is an anomaly.  This is my first OnePlus phone, and probably my last."", 'He recibido el equipo en Ecuador como siempre por temas de aduana se demoro 7 días adicionales en la entrega, el móvil llego en perfectas condiciones, funciona de maravilla excelente fluidez, muy buena cámara, se ve y siente que su calidad de construcción es muy buena, la pantalla de 90 hz se ve muy bien, la conexión con mi operadora CNT funciona correctamente, en resumen es un movil muy recomendado.', ""I loved the phone itself and how snappy everything was and how extremely fast the battery charged but the cellular service was trash (mint mobile) and no it's not my carrier mint is absolutely amazing and I have had zero issues with this company.

The 6GB RAM is great and should make this phone useful for a long time, but only overseas.  The construction is solid and well thought out.  I only wish it supported voLTE.  I returned the phone when T-Mobile explained that, from the IMEI, this phone could not run on their network.

I purchased this phone as a replacement for him, with low expectations. This phone has exceeded all of my expectations! My husband is really hard on his phone, he has a dirty job and he drops it a lot so I didn\'t want to spend a lot of money. This phone (granted, I have it in a good case and recommend that you purchase a case and screen protector as well - protect your investment!) has already been dropped onto a concrete floor ""more times than my husband can count"" and is showing no signs of damage.This phone was really easy to set up and get started. I plugged it in and charged it up first, and then I powered it on. As soon as I powered it on, it walked me through setup. Extremely easy. I was able to take the SIM card out of my husband\'s old Samsung phone and pop it in this phone, and it worked immediately. We are with FIDO.  I will mention that there is only a spot for ONE SIM card, the other spot is for a memory card. So if you\'re looking to use this phone for dual SIM cards, it won\'t work.The screen is nice and large, and the picture is really, really clear. Although the screen is much larger than his last phone, the phone still fits comfortably in hand. Compared to his old phone, the camera is absolutely incredible. The pictures that he takes now (mostly of our dog) are very clear and crisp. The pictures are so good that you can blow them up and print them and they still look great, not pixelated. My husband primarily uses this phone to text and make calls (easy, straightforward), browse the internet (works great) and play a few App games like Clash of Clans (he says it works great for these games). He has had zero issues downloading apps to this phone. Husband tells me that on his previous phone, games were a bit laggy. On this new phone, they\'re very fast. He\'s very pleased with the new higher speed. The phone is very user friendly, and things like his email account are easily accessible from the home screen (you can organize your home screen however you like) so he is doing a better job at keeping on top of his inbox. This phone doesn\'t have crazy bells and whistles, but it does everything my husband needs to do and it does it well. Calls are reliable, and the sound is crisp and clear. Playing games, there\'s no lag. No issues with WIFI or roaming. The camera works well. 64 GB gives my husband lots of storage space. The phone comes with a charge cord and a fast charging block. It works great and the phone is fully charged within an hour. My hubby uses his phone throughout the day - playing games, watching YouTube videos, texting, browsing TikTok...and still the battery lasts all day. Battery life percentage is indicated on the top right corner of the screen, and it also indicates when the phone is plugged in and charging. Very straightforward. I\'m quite impressed with the battery life so far, no issues there.  My husband doesn\'t like fingerprint reader or face protection, so although this phone can do both, my husband has it locked with a pattern. He was grateful for this option as he wears glasses and face recognition generally just makes him frustrated. The bluetooth on this phone works well and hubby has no issues pairing things like his wireless ear buds or speaker. Sound quality is very good.The only thing that I am disappointed with regarding this phone is the lack of ability to charge wirelessly. I have a charge pad that unfortunately doesn\'t work with this phone, the phone has to be plugged in to charge. Not a deal breaker, but definitely a bit disappointing.This phone is exactly what we needed. My husband is very happy with it! If you\'re looking for an inexpensive, reliable phone with a great camera - I recommend this one! It\'s every bit as good as my (much, much more expensive) Samsung S 21. I wish I had bought myself this phone and saved the money, honestly.', ""I've had this phone for a couple of years now and I am still very happy with its performance. I definitely would recommend this product."", 'Good product, arrived on time.', ""The battery lasts 2 days with regular use....now it's new, remains to be seen how long the battery will go in 3-6-9-12 months, but initially fantastic. On top of that, the camera works beautifully, the call quality top notch....very happy with my purchase and so far would recommend. I switched from an LG V30, which was thinner and lighter, but the battery on it was dying quickly. This phone is heavier, but the performance is well worth it. The fingerprint option works very well even with the case."", ""Bought this for a teenager and seems to do the job fine. It's not going to be a top of the line phone so keep your expectations in check. Battery last quite a long time as expected from specs. Though charging is slower. Screen size is bigger than I am used to. I was concerned screen brightness was not going to be as good as the A32 4G but it's fine. Finger print reader is on side which is a bit different than what I am used to. Honestly, it works fine for things like YouTube, Discord messaging, Instagram, etc. Has headphone jack which is great for my teenager to use. Overall, I don't expect this to be a forever phone, but is certainly a good first phone for a teenager to use. Based on what Samsung says I should hopefully see at least 3 years of update which is probably good enough."", 'This phone is a open box product and comes with all the features /adequate for the money spent <$287 Screen resolution is adequate and not comparing it to megabuck phones.This phone has headphone jack and I find it good value for the money spent.', 'The phone arrived well ahead of the estimated delivery date.  I am still figuring out how to use the phone as this is my first smartphone, but two things I can say is that 1) it is slippery.  This thing is just an accident waiting to happen as reviews elsewhere have pointed out.  With this in mind, I immediately purchased a phone wallet that now holds the phone.  2) The electrical wall plug adapter gets really warm when charging.', ""This phone was exactly what I was hoping it would be. It's 5g, has a powerful processor, and a good amount of storage with the option to add more via card. It also looks and feels very nice. You save a ton of money on the fact that this phone has a plastic casing, which is fine. Just make sure to buy a case for it when you get the phone so it's properly protected. But who doesn't get a case anyways? It's a solid phone with a really great battery. I don't always charge it each night as the battery is good enough to last 2 days if I'm not gaming constantly on it. very nice phone. I would highly recommend it to others."", 'I buy this phone  a few days ago because I just need its two SIM card possibility. I read lot reviews and specification about this phone, and bought it. When it arrived, I found it does not offer such dual SIM option. Called Samsung Canada, saying there are two versions, one can hold two SIM cards, one cannot. I do not know why the seller does not mention this important information. The shipping and service are good, and phone is also very nice, however I have to return it (and the case...).Not very bad, just not so pleasant. So I give three star rating.', 'Bought two, both are working flawlessly after a few months. Everything about these phones is *good*, not great but comes in at a quarter the cost of so called *great* phones. Would recommend and purchase again.']"

It's very resilient, but you'll also want to use a screen protector, back camera protector and a durable shock case to protect it. They phone can handle multiple apps and games running without problems. I would use this phone for gaming and business.It even has remote capabilities to act as a universal remote for Blu Ray, televisions, stereos, DVD players, air conditioners, satellite dishes, and a lot more. It has amazing sound and graphics. It has NFC for Google pay. I recommend a antivirus program like ESET or Avast.It's water resistant to some degree. It comes with a case that protects the phone and the ports in the phone from fluids and dirt, but I would get a better one if you can.Pictures and video is crystal clear. It's capabilities are great. It is very fast because of the 8 GB RAM and stores a lot with 128 GB of storage. Do not use mi browser as I don't trust it. Use Chrome or download another browser if you can. It does come with a worthless power adaptor. So you will need to buy one. The one that comes with it for some other region of the world, not North America. And the outlet adapter for the power adaptor isn't compatible. It's just some random, useless garbage. There isn't any English or Spanish customer service for the phone, so you have to be tech savvy if you have an issue. It is one of the of the best phones ever made, though.It's definitely worth buying.

Having read about One Plus Oxygen being an open source port of Android that gets pretty good reviews I decided to go for the One Plus 9 5G. My carrier is Google Fi, and I was so disappointed they started selling Samsung phones, of which I'm not a fan at all.First thing I noticed after purchasing it was the fit and finish is quite nice. It's not a brick, not svelte per se, but it has a good weight to it. The width was a welcome change from the Pixel 3XL. That minor reduction in width made this much more capable as a single hand phone. I'm not one to really care about fingerprints but you will get fingerprints all over the back and the face...again, whatevs.The speed. Out of the gate, when I dropped my Google Fi sim into the device the first thing I noticed was the speed. This is a fast tight phone. Which I do appreciate. Especially since my Pixel was on it's last legs and I really did need a replacement that would be a decent upgrade.If you purchase the unlocked version you should be aware of a few settings so your coverage is taking advantage of both WiFi calling/data, and roaming. Which sort of leads me to believe that since you have to make those adjustments in the settings menu. I wonder how many people have purchased the phone and thought, damn my coverage is awful with this thing.  So, I ding them for that....but then, this isn't a on and done purchase. You have to do a bit of finagling with the hardware. Welcome to Android....lol.Charging. WOW...just WOW. I have a 15w wireless charger I used with my Pixel and it charges the One Plus 9 5G...just fine....and...not sure I get why people complain about the wireless charging but in my experience it's just fine. At work I charge it connected to a docking station and.....it's FAST. And that's using my Pixel charging cable.Battery life. I don't think this is intended as a battery sipper. it will go through a full charge in a day. With some room to spare. But overall I wasn't dismayed by the battery life. I've tested it with the various and NUMEROUS battery life extension settings on the phone, some of which are confusing...again...welcome to Android. But I like playing around with stuff like this;Camera. Love it. It's great. I've literally taken shots with my Pixel that I regard as stunning. And in the few weeks I've had the One Plus 9 5G, can't complain at all. If anything, I've noticed a depth of color in both wide  and closer shots that feels more realistic and to be honest I'm kind of shocked at how well the camera works compared to the Pixel 3XL, which...I really loved that camera, a lot. The interface is quite different but it's responsive and the level of tweeking you can do to get your shot is miles apart from the Pixel.What's not so great: Well, on the second week I scratched the screen, Just above the fingerprint sensor. I had it in my pocket with some keys, my bad, and I was kind of surprised it scratched so easily. I've had my Pixel for over 3 years, handling the exact same way and I never experienced that. The screen never had any wear at all. The scratch isn't bad, you can only see it if you look at it at an angle. But still. This concerns me.Fingerprint sensor: hit or miss. It's built into the front of the screen, which is nice. But, it takes multiple tries to unlock, and if your fingers are particularly dry, or just off from the sensor. Yes, you'll get a warning and have to enter your pin after so many tries. To be honest, this doesn't bother me that much. But it has been an annoyance a few times.Choices!: There's a LOT to play with in the settings, for me not a big deal at all, for others....gives me pause. Not sure I'd recommend this phone to someone not into having fun with the settings. Or a person that just wants to turn it on a go.File transfers to Mac: It'd be nice if I could connect the phone to my mac to transfer files. The phone automatically offers a USB driver to install when you connect it to a PC. Not so much with a Mac. There was an article on the One Plus website about enabling developer mode so you could enable USB logging so you could do file transfers....tried it, didn't work. Not a deal breaker but.....again, not the most user friendly experience.Conclusion: I like the phone, and I think it'll serve me for what I need it to do. Speed, durability and camera. 5G coverage where I'm at is, spotty, but, have noticed a speed boost when it does show up in the top menu bar...which again...wow, LOADS of icons in the top home screen menu bar...it's kinda funny. And Camera, I used my camera phone on my Pixel all the time. If this phone's camera was lackluster or a compromise I would have sent it back fast.  But from what I've experienced, especially the camera interface, I have a lot to play with and for that I'm excited."", 'Sin duda es uno de los mejores celulares que eh probado, si lo encuentras en promoción de 6,000 pesos yo terminé pagando 7,000 por los impuestos de USA. México, ya que este celular viene de estados unidos y también es la versión estado unidense, por lo que viene con cargador apto para México...Hablando del celular puedo decir que a mi gusto es muy bonito, me fascina este color morado que tiene, considero que el tamaño es perfecto ya que no es ni pequeño ni grandisimo, la pantalla plana me gusta mucho ya que no te problemas como podria darte un pantalla curva, el peso del celular también es muy bueno pesando aprox unos 185 gramos, y también es delgado com unos marcos considerablemente reducidos, en cuanto a al software este celular es muy potente con el procesador Snapdragon 888 aunque algo que he notado y no me gustó (creo que es el problema mas notorio del celular) es el calentamiento, este procesador en general tiene fama de calentarse considerablemente y puede hacerlo mucho dependiendo del clima en el que estes y también del uso que le estes dando, otra cosa que no me gustó mucho es la duración de la batería dandote cómo Maximo unas 6 hrs de pantalla con uso moderado con el 100% de bateria, y también depende mucho del uso que le des, con un uso rudo la bateria te da como unas 3-4 hrs, eso usando los 120htz de pantalla, la solución a esto es que tiene una carga muy rapida de 67w y la verdad es una de las cosas que mas me gusto de este dispositivo cargando el celular en aproximadamente unos 40-45 minutos del 10-100% y con tan solo 20 minutos que lo conectes tienes mas del 60% cargado por lo cual este celular me encanto, en general creo que el celular es muy completo, sus camaras con colaboración con Hasselblad son buenas, toma fotos mas que cumplidoras asi que si encuentras este celular en menos de 7,000 con todo e impuestos te lo recomiendo mucho, otra cosa que quiero aclarar es que es compatible con todas las compañías en México, yo uso la compañía Bait, por si alguien tenia la duda.', 'I got this after using multiple Samsung and Google phones, all of which had their own issues. After using it for some time, here are my impressions with both good and not so good parts.Good parts:- The build quality is good, the phone feels great in hand and has some weight to it, unlike phones like Google Pixel 5 which feels like a cheap toy. You can also watch video by JerryRigEverything, this phone does not bend easily with very strong frame.- The display quality is good, especially pixel density, which is 525 ppi. I have tried phones with lower pixel density such as Pixel 5, they\'re ok if your vision is good but if you have nearsightedness and have to use phone close to your face you will easily notice individual pixels on phones with lower pixel density. On OnePlus 9 Pro you will not have this issue.- The OS is better than on Samsung phones. It is close to stock, there is no bloat like on Samsung phones, many apps can be uninstalled except apps like Gallery or Netflix. It is close to Pixel phone OS, except the launcher on OnePlus is better than Google\'s own launcher because you can do more customizations like remove Google search bar (I don\'t use it) or remove stock widget from home screen (you can\'t do this on Pixel phones unless you will use different launcher) or do more customizations in terms of adding different icons or changing colors. OnePlus also uses stock Google dialer and messages apps, they are much better than Samsung\'s apps because they filter spam much better and Google\'s dialer has integrated visual voicemail (this feature depends on your provider, it works on Verizon but might not work with some other provider) and Google\'s messages app has support for RCS messaging which you can enable even if your carrier does not want to. You can also customize features such as adding black bar on top of display to hide front camera, something that Samsung used to allow but then they disabled this feature in One UI 3. The OnePlus launcher also looks better from visual point of view compared to Samsung\'s One UI - Samsung really overdid ""rounded corners"" on every pop-up message box and every menu in their phones, I really dislike it. OnePlus launcher has much less pronounced ""rounded corners"" in menus and message boxes which look better and hopefully something that OnePlus will never change.- The fingerprint reader works good for me, much more reliable than what I have seen on Samsung phones with their under display fingerprint readers. Just be aware that third-party screen protectors may interfere with it.- The cameras produce good photo quality, especially after latest updates. Initially the photo quality was pretty poor as you can see from all old reviews, but OnePlus has released many updates which increased the photo quality to good levels. It\'s still not as good as on Pixel phones but very close and with more updates will probably get even better.- The battery life is good after all recent updates. Both the standby and use time with display on are pretty good and better than similar models from Samsung. This will probably get even better with more updates by OnePlus.Not so good parts:- The phone is pretty expensive, especially without good trade-in programs. You can find Galaxy S21+ for cheaper price, especially with great trade-in program that Samsung offers.- The phone still has some software bugs which are not fixed, such as bugs with bluetooth which affects some people or bugs with automatic brightness adjustment. All of those will probably fixed with future updates but the phone should not have been released with those bugs.- The phone has SnapDragon 888 processor, it is known for high power consumption which creates high heat output. It affected many phones including phones from Samsung and also affected this model. The manufacturers are still trying to adjust this processor\'s power consumption in their phones, Samsung already does it well but OnePlus has not reached their level yet. You may still see overheat warnings on this model if you live in a warm climate and do things like filming 4k video at high fps. I personally hasn\'t experienced it but you may find other examples of it. This is something you need to be aware of before buying it.', ""Many reviews stated that this was a used phone. I received this phone in mint condition and was quick and easy to switch from my one android phone to this one. Cloning was smooth. There was no factory screen film on the phone, but it was sealed in the box and the phone was in a sealed foam sleave.I'm giving it 4 stars not 5, because I cannot remove the T-Mobile apps, but I was expecting that as per the comments.Battery life is not a good as my wife's Asus Zenfone 5Q, but I do get a couple days at normal usage, and have the power to play the intensive games when I want and quick charge in 15 minutes, when needed. The quick charge does heat up the phone, so I do try to limit that.This phone is super quick and the screen is amazing. The camera reviews put it at a mediocre camera. I took a picture in low light and it looked like it was taken in broad daylight and crisp colors. You do need to switch to full resolution manually other wise it defaults to 12MP.  This does give a great balance of quality and drive space usage."", ""This is a fabulous phone, and why it gets 5 stars.  Scren is great.  Fingerprint and face unlock is great.  Super fast on 5G.  I'm very happy now that I have gotten it to work.But a couple of warnings:If you are a Sprint customer who thinks you are a T-Mobile customer, you are NOT!  You are still on the Sprint telecommunications network, even though you are able to also use the T-Mobile towers.  This phone, no matter what you do, WILL NOT ACTIVATE on the Sprint network.  Not even in any kind compatibility mode.  Sprint's activation and registration software and systems identifies this phone as a FOREIGN device and there is NO WAY to activate the IMEI number range this phone has been assigned on the Sprint network.  Don't waste your time trying!  I tried 3 different ways.  Not happening!The only way I could get the phone to activate was to open up a T-Mobile account and transfer my number over.  If you are a single phone line Sprint customer and do not have any balance owed on yourphone, this is an easy thing to do.  And you should do it.  The phone activates instantly on the T-Mobile network.But if you have any balance on your Sprint account for any of your active lines, you will need to pay all of those balances off to zero them before you can move over to T-Mobile.  Again, another wonderful side affect of the Sprint and T-Mobile accounting systems not yet being compatible.Again, if you have been a Sprint customer, you are not yet a T-Mobile customer.  Not until you have switched your account.  At this point, this has to be done by you.  And can not be done if you still have outstanding balances (lease, payments) for your phone on Sprint.  T-Mobile is not doing this automatically yet.  The Sprint phone support I talked to said that there may be some work starting offering deals to get Sprint customers converted over the holidays.  So look for that.Lastly, two days after I bought the phone, Amazon lowered the price by $100.  I chatted with the Amazon Customer support team to see if I could get a refund of the difference in prices.  Again, NOT HAPPENING!  It's not in Amazon's customer service policy to refund differences in prices for your purchases when they happen in just a 2 day period.  I could understand a longer duration, like 5 or more days.  But TWO DAYS?  Really?  I have had experience with a large number of brick-and-mortor retailers that would happily refund the difference in purchase price when an items prices are reduced shortly after purchase.  So, be warned that Amazon does not have a customer service policy like this and seems to not have any way to offer a customer pleasing exemption.I guess I could take some comfort in the idea that my non-refunded $100 could go towards more rocket fuel for Jeff Bazos' next trip into space."", 'The only concern i have it gets quite warm after 1 hour of scrolling through the net, battery life is also very good. All in all i am happy with my purchase', ""Phone is awesome other than it's a bit slower than expected when using WiFi and data at the same time it's supposed to be faster but no other than that it's great"", ""I had to change the telecom operator from metro by T-Mobile to at&t. The description stated that the phone was completely unblocked. It's very uncomfortable, plus it costs money. The phone itself is just amazing, especially after my Samsung a 32."", ""This phone is honestly great. Unlocked for your phone carrier and you could also unlock the bootloader too and root, install custom roms etc. I bought this at the time since it was one of the last oneplus phones that gave customers access to msm tools which allows you to restore your phone if you somehow mess up installing custom roms. The phone is fast, amoled screen looks nice and crisp. The snapdragon 888 processor is fast but it does heat up. I've rooted the phone and simply underclock it so it actually stays nice and cool all the time and even extends the battery life.If you're deciding between an older flagship and a midrange phone, I think pretty much you're always going to get a better deal with an older flagship (betters specs) unless you need a specific feature from a budget phone like sd card or phone jack.My only real complaint about this phone is the in-display fingerprint reader. It's not as fast as back fingerprint readers but I can't blame oneplus as android a whole has moved towards using in-display finger readers. Also if your thumb is slightly wet then it likely won't read your fingerprint."", ""This phone is really good if you understand it's $729.Pro's:-Oxygen OS (Near stock android which is what I prefer)-120Hz display that is locked at 120Hz-Specs for $729-Works on all carriers (5G only on Verizon/Visible and T-Mobile)-no call issues on Verizon unlike what T-Mobile customers are experiencing-improved camera over OnePlus 8 Pro (despite having the same main sensor as the 8 Pro)-Fast using experience-Fingerprint sensor works good and in a good location for my grip style-solid battery life (gets me a solid day out of it even with a 120Hz display)-alert slider (I never knew I needed this till used it)-Warp Charge 65T (holy hell is it fast)Con's:-Nightscape (night mode) is hit or miss (could be improved with a software update)-some pictures look like the sun is starting to go down yet it's the middle of the afternoon (could be improved with a software update)-tap to bring up AOD and double tap to wake is a wee bit too sensitive-Fingerprint sensor is not near instant to unlock (it takes a second or 2 to unlock the phone)-no WiFi calling on Verizon yet (coming via a software update in May according to a rumor)-No C-Band 5G on Verizon yet (though that's coming later this year and I'm hoping it's Verizon's Mid band 5G network)-No mmWave 5G (honestly not a deal breaker but I have access to UWB from Verizon in my area)-alert slider is too stiff (I have to use a wee bit of force to change it to vibrate or silent)-No telephoto lensThis is a solid phone from OnePlus. I was a long time Google Phone user (had the iPhone 4, Samsung S3, Samsung S4, Samsung S5, Moto X 2014, Nexus 5X, and Google Pixel 2 XL previously) since 2014 when Google owned Motorola. The camera is good, but deffo needs some software updates to make it even better. I love Oxygen OS because it's near stock android so it's an easy jump from my Pixel. So if you still have your Pixel, Pixel 2, or Pixel 3 and don't want to break the bank on your next phone then I'd recommend this.Something to keep in mind:The Samsung S21 is constantly on sale for around the price of this phone and it could be a hard sell if you're not into the software experience that OnePlus offers. Samsung packs a wee bit more features and specs for that price. So it really comes down the software experience you prefer.""]"

It doesn't follow the high refresh rate trend but the colors of this screen are great.The feel in hand, with this device LG were going for a different approach. They were going for the best looking and feeling device they could make. They hit it right on the head with this. The device feels awesome when holding it, and the pearly white on the back shimmers beautifully in the sunshine.Software support, this one is up in the air right now since LG stepped away from mobile. However currently my device is running Android 10 with the June security patch. It is supposed to get Android 11 so we shall see.Cameras, it's an LG device so the cameras are going to do great for most people.

The screen is every so slightly curved at the side edges to make like a ""bezelless"" display, and it works rather well.  The only issue is any light caught by this curve, which is *any* light as the display is rather reflective, it\'ll be stretched due to the curve so the entire edge is a reflection and anything that might be displayed on this edge is covered by said reflection.As I said, this is rather minor, but there it is.  In all honesty my next phone (some years from now) will be a fully flat display, no more bezel curves.']"

THIS IS OPEN BOXED! Period. Not 'Brand NEW'. Carrier phones MUST be active on a carrier for a period of time before they can be UNLOCKED. So This is OPENED and activated. Then they unlock it after the period, Repackage it when it's been unlocked. But it is still got the internal carrier items from it's system and will boot from it's carrier service provider logo. This is a ATT GSM. So yes it WILL work on T-mobile network, But you'll need to put a T-mobile Sim card in and do normal phone activation. Then wait about a hour or more depending on so for it to 'log' itself. The steps normally to do this, is to TURN the phone OFF COMPLETELY. Then place your new provider SIM card inside. Turn on. Let it load. Then let it sit after logging in/opening your phone screen up for everything to internally load apps.etc.  Get the phone activated, Then reset. It should now fix it's logo load up with which ever provider you going with (Tmobile if you're switching to it. or ATT will just stay same.). T-mobile and ATT are both GSM radio bands. Sprint (Non activable anymore since it's T-mobile/GSM band now.) And Version are the Velvet 5G UW Which is a different phone then this and uses CDMA radio band. Which you cannot use on this phone.2et. LARGELY recommend you do a 2et format on the phone when you get it. Because the user does do a reset, it's not 100% fully reset. So best bet is to do a true factory reset,etc after you do a 'basic' setup that doesn't have your google,etc account active or sim yet. This'll make sure you have a truly cleared phone.Besides that. The phone came nicely package, almost new-like Thought again since this is a UNLOCKED Carrier version phone and not a truly 'unlocked' global phone. I kinda expected it to be semi-open box but not really used, Since ATT has a 45day activation requirement before the phone can even be unlocked fully from their carrier to switch to T-mobile if one were to do. But it came clean, Had all it's plugs and cables. Paperwork. etc.Turned it on and did basic setup, then reformated it again. Setup, and found a rather beans of a secret from carriers. (Though still working on if this is just ATT, or for all carriers.). Phone is dead set on stock version 900ULM-E version. Which is JUNE update of 2020. And you cannot do a 'update' Till it's setup with a carrier. So if you plan to get this without a sim card. You'll be stuck on a stock update of a year old and android 10, With no ability to update it unless you firmware flash, or sim sit it. But a cheap prepaid sim can fix that, But still pain in the neck that you have to do that to get a decent update.Other then that. Phone is nice. Works pretty well and ATT just got Android 11 on it (again requires you to be on active carrier service to get updates. Cannot update via WIFI without carrier activated sim system.).Desktop mode works pretty well, Though can't change that and most of the thems/wallpaper on the phone are pretty limited from LG (ugh.). But performance is nice (slightly better then a Motorola One Fusion. Velvet having 582gigaflops/Fusion having 384gigaflops.). For gaming. The options on their gaming launcher is also pretty nice. Custom mode to change the resolution from High/Normal/Low to FPS to high/normal/low. So you can change some games system down for better FPS, or put a limit to FPS speeds.Tethering is also nice. Dual band, Almost as great as a S20 ultra's wifi speed performance, Just slightly less in stability. But still smooth. And Tether you can do Wifi sharing, instead of just mobile data. + with android 11. You now get Ethernet tether (Ether Wifi to Ethernet or Mobile to Ethernet.). (10 doesn't have this. But still has Wifi sharing.).Screen is nice and good for a P-OLED (Aka LG's version of AMOLED). But maybe it's just my settings, But i found that on my vs a S20 Ultra's screen. This tends to have a more retained color across, then dimming colors together as a ultra does. Which i compared side by side with on Eve Echoes, and the Green color came out more on the Velvet then Ultra. With less color change on the LG. But again this could probably just be my settings on Custom mode to normal saturation and maxed sharpness. So it's not a knock to being a bad screen. Just weird from my point of view, Others it won't be a problem.Speakers are nice. Though i think their slightly a little to the loud speaker side then to the headpiece speaker, Since this is a stereo speaker system the loud/headpiece both place. But seems slightly to the right speaker seeming more louder then the left, But maybe this is mainly just me in how the balance goes. But the volume does seem alittle on the low side, Like you need more volume up to hear things more then compared to the ultra. Not meaning it's tinny or anything. Just the volume doesn't have that high of output in general. So you normally got turn things up more then normally.Back to the screen. It's got curves. Which can be a Plus to some. And a con to others.This does have slight curve shadowing effects on the screen, And you don't get much curve edge touch support. So you aren't gonna get that edge touch ability to mess around on the corners.Finger print, Voice activated locks. Now i haven't done the voice phraze unlocking. But the phone does support optical finger print unlocking. This can be a Plus and con to some. It's a plus to some that aren't liking their screen protectors to have a huge hole where the print reader is (like the ultra gets on their screen protectors because of the ultrasonic reader.). But this is also a con due to it's less guarding of your phone. Optical print readers are more of a 'camera' taking a picture of your finger. So if someone has a phone of your finger print and they tried opening your phone. They can do it due to the fact it's only a camera taking a picture to know the print. Unlike the Ultrasonic fingerprint reader on galaxy phones that use sonic waves of sound to bounce off the face of your finger, and sense all the little nooks and bits of your fingerprint to send back to the phone. This is better guarding then optical, Because it doesn't take a picture of your finger. It reads the grooves of your finger print, So if a image is posted on the print reader, This won't work because the sonic waves will sense it's a flat piece instead of the grooves on your finger.Also there is no selfie/photo unlocking with this phone. Only print/Voice unlock.Good phone. But do alittle research. Sadly this likely is the last phone to, besides the V60/G8X-G8S series. Since LG has left the game. But supposedly they'll be giving it Android 12 and Android 13 updates. So it'll have it's life to the end."", 'Dudaba antes de comprarlo, llevo 1 año de uso y sigue impecable, el modelo es un poco viejo, pero no le pide nada a los modelos más modernos, la cámara no es la mejor, pero es muy resistente a los golpes, al polvo y al agua, lo tengo de uso rudo y nunca me ha fallado. Cuando hace mucho calor, el celular se calienta y lo apago para evitar cualquier problema. Es un celular con buen procesador, una pantalla LED excelente, el diseño es fenomenal, 102 GB libres para almacenamiento interno, está liberado para todas las compañías celulares a excepción de Bite.  El sistema operativo como visualizador de camara, administrador de operaciones es muy eficiente. A todos mis conocidos se los he recomendado, un verdadera joya!', ""I can't say enough good things about this phone for the price I paid. I got it At&t unlocked so I knew it would be coming opened an slightly used. I wanted a new At&t locked version of the phone but didn't wanna have to go to the store to buy it however this one worked too. So it came in a box inside another box. Packaged very well wasn't damaged during shipping which btw was blazing fast bought it Wednesday had it in my hand Friday morning when my mail went. I wish it would've came w the wired headphones but it didn't. However everything else was there. The phone itself didn't have a mark on it an still had the original stickers on n the top an bottom of the phone. Was weird however out of the box the phone was on so the battery was pretty drained when I got it so I plugged it in let it charge for awhile an put my sim in it. I got wifi calling texting an volte. Which is what I needed it for. It exceeded my expectations of this phone off the bat w the smooth yet colorful display, fast when switching through multiple apps, camera is awesome (some close up pics can get pixley) but for 200 because I had a 100 gift card it was well worth the money. It has dual speakers an are very loud n crisp. Still has the 3mm headphone jack that I love. I love lgs screens always have. It's a bummer there no longer in the cell phone industry. It updated to Android 11 no problems. I all around love this phone the only small very small thing I have a pick w an it's y I didn't give a 4 star review. The battery. However I understand if your on your phone alot it consumes battery however. I'm only maybe 3 hours total out of a day an if I'm on Facebook talking u might as well hook up a charger cause it will die fast. Now if ur not watching you tube or on Facebook talking the battery isn't that bad. I can leave 100% at 11am n at 8pm when I get home I still have about 85% or more. The fast charging isn't fast though kinda slow compared to the mia1 I have from 4 years ago it's tops off in under a hr from 0 to 100 an this one takes about 2 wireless charging the 1st night I didn't even get a 100% I thought it was the charger itself so I got another one did the samething. However it seems that the longer I use this phone the better the battery life gets an the wireless charger is now capable of charging to 100% even though it takes it almost 5 hours or more. I hope this review helped someone out in deciding to buy this phone. It feels amazing in the hand quality feel an not heavy but made sturdy. Doesn't feel cheap or platic. Tha k u lg for this wonderful device!"", ""If you're looking for a budget Android phone that has wireless charging or NFC, this is it.  My provider is Red Pocket, but it's running on the AT&T network (GSMA), which is why I purchased this phone.Pros:- Nice Display- Speed and memory is plenty for most users- Thin and not too heavy- Wireless charging works beautifullyCons:- VERY SLIPPERY, it's like it's been coated with butter.  If you're like most people and get a case, it's not an issue though- FINGERPRINT READER: Horrible, just horrible.  Took many attempts to teach-in, and recognition is not working well.  It's really bad.- End Of Life product: Since LG exited the smartphone business, don't expect too many Android updatesUSING ON RED POCKET GSMA: I simply moved my SIM from my old Motorola into the Velvet, configured the APN settings (as per Red Pocket website), saved the APN and rebooted the phone.  Took maybe 5 to 10 minutes and I was all ready to go.  If your local cell tower supports it, you'll get 5G.GETTING ANDROID UPDATES: If you are NOT an actual AT&T customer (for example if you're on Red Pocket), you will be unable to get android updates through the usual update mechanism (the phone ships with Android 10 and when you try to update, it tells you that you're already on the latest version).  There is no way to update yourself, but if you go to the AT&T website and chat, just tell them that you have an AT&T Velvet 5G phone but you're not an AT&T customer but want the software update.  They will ask for your phone's IMEI, and within 24 hours you will be able to update.  They were very nice about it and I'm now on Android 11 (the most current as of April 2022)HOTSPOT: Out of the box (with Red Pocket as provider), the hotspot feature does not work.  Red Pocket support hasn't been great, unfortunately, in fixing it.  I will update once it's working."", 'I wanted the nfc function in case I needed it for the future. Wireless charging is slow and I would think if you use the wrong kind of armor it might be slower or worse but it does work. My turbo charger works well with it but I go through power cables fast on the phone side usb c of course so try to use good cables or experience slower charging. 5g was not working but lo and behold this morning I noticed att 5g is working and I checked and now my prepaid $40 account has 5g now. Looks like they all do. I will edit with the armor I am using & it has integrated screen protector. Stereo sound is awesome and loud. Battery runtime is ok. Camera exceeds my needs. Bunch of garbage apps on there but I disabled/deleted as many as I could and once in a great while they come back. I have been upgraded to android 12. Using 128GB SD card might bump that up but got a 1TB crucial external SSD and it works beautifully with phone so I might just manage videos I keep on phone since I get enough storage on SSD. I just like to keep my SD card 1/2 empty in case I come across a unicorn, dragon or bigfoot that might pose for me.Poetic Spartan Series for LG... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LK7LD8V?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share', ""It's ok"", ""The phone is great, especially for the cost. Getting rid of all the AT&T app's that came with the unlocked phone (can't really remove, just deactivate so that they hide) and stopping automatic app installs was a bit of a pain, but after stopping the automatic download and installs of random apps the phone works great. 1st 2 days I multitasked by running multiple apps while watching videos and listening to plenty of music in order to test the battery drainage rate and its propensity to heat up. The results were impressive: No heat, barely warm, and the battery's drainage rate was reasonable for being on a 5G network. The battery still lasted the whole day, despite the extreme use of multitasking.  The stereo speakers make music sound great. I can even hear the seperation of instruments -its speaker's fadelity are that good. The reason for its lower price is because it does not come with a dual screen case, which sells for around $150 to $200.Update: after having this phone for a few months I was wondering if I was receiving security updates on this phone through my T-mobile service. Turns out that the answer is -no. LG informed me that in order to get security updates (including the upgrade from android 10 to android 11) 1 has to do the following: buy a SIM card from the phone's original service provider (this phone's original carrier is AT&T) in order to get the updates and latest version of android. Swap SIM cards each time 1 wants to check if the phone's software is up to date. So, 1 has to buy a SIM card from the phone's original service provider (around $4). Then activate the service on that SIM for 1 day, which costs $2 per day. Wait at most a day for that original provider to activate the original provider's SIM card. Then go to the phone's settings to download the phone's software updates. Swap back in your new provider's (mine is T-mobile) SIM card once the updates are installed. Something to think about if one is thinking about buying an unlocked phone with the intent of using it with a cellphone service that differs from its pre-unlocked provider."", ""First of all, I purchased this phone (G900UM) to use it in Ecuador . I just had to switch the sim card from my old phone to this new one and just like that, it was ready to use.This version does not include the FM radio feature (bummer) , and the optical fingerprint reader does not works well (feature worked to perfection in the G6 model) . Also, it does not include face recognition , but anyway I'm highly satisfied with the cameras that this phone brings, selfies are superb! Pictures taken with the main camera are just wow.  The speaker has a really loud volume but comparing to a G8 or a V60, it kinda lacks of audio quality.  The screen resolution is brutal, 60 fps videos will left you gagging...seriously. The phone is big, so if you enjoy gaming you'll enjoy this screen too.Such a shame that LG have decided to stop manufacturing phones.  LG Velvet is pretty fine, but if you are looking for top notch performance, LG V60 is the guy."", 'No updates are possible because it is an American phone. However by using various android apps you can have most of what android 12 has to offer even if this has only a vesion 10 of android. This is why I gave it only a 3 star.

The best way to describe the Umidigi A9 Pro is it's a very good phone and a very good value.Screen/LooksThe screen is big, bright, and crisp.  The pics don't do the back justice but it's beautiful, like really nice.  They've also included a basic clear case and screen protector to get you started.  The phone looks premium with the metal bezel and quality of materials.Speaker/SoundsThe speaker is louder than I expected and plays music and system sounds quite loudly.  Speaking of sounds, the phone has a headphone jack which is a welcome addition, especially at this price point.BatteryThe battery lasts me about 1 1/2 - 2 days with moderate use.  I'm not a gamer or YouTube binge watcher so your results may vary but I've been pleasantly surprised by the battery.ThermometerAnother nice surprise was the inclusion and accuracy of the thermometer.  I expected it to be more of a novelty and not all that accurate or useful.  I was surprised at how quickly it measures and how accurate.  Not something you'd use everyday but it's there and can be trusted when you need it.CameraNot outstanding but better than most mid-budget phones.  It struggles in low light but is actually pretty nice for general landscape, portrait, and other scenes.  Again, it's not going to blow you away but also not going to disappoint you with realistic expectations.PerformanceThe CPU and benchmark performance is decent, especially for the price point, but not going to compete with the flagship phones.  But in my real world use, I haven't noticed even a little lag or slowness.  The performance in real world use is way more than adequate but it may struggle with some hardware intensive gaming.OverallAs mentioned, I think this phone is a very good phone and a great value.  If you're looking for a mid-budget phone, the Umidigi A9 Pro should be at or near the top of your list."", ""Thank Amazon for having an amazing customer service because if not I would be stuck with this phone. First off, after a month of using this phone it straight up just stopped working. For a while it was doing a thing where it would start pressing random things on my screen so it would open up apps and play music and open websites and type random stuff up, etc. like a ghost dog was licking the phone or something. Finally it just dropped out and wouldn't work. Lines across the screen, static, touch screen didn't work, couldn't see the screen anymore, totally unusable. Only thing you could do was turn it on and off and see scrambled picture. Amazon has 90 days guarantee as opposed to umidigi's 30 days, so amazon took it back and sent me another phone instantly. 2 days later I had a brand new a9 pro. Right out of the box it wasn't connecting to mobile network. How is this possible, because I just had an a9 pro that did work just a couple days ago that had no issues with connecting. So I got on tech support with mobile company and they determined there was something wrong with the hardware aka the new phone I just got. I was on the line with them for hours trying to figure it out, there was nothing they could do, and my sim card worked perfectly in all other phones. Immediately I checked if return was possible and it was, so I am sending it off tomorrow morning with free return mail via amazon. Once again, thank amazon for having this type of customer service. They may be unethical business but darn if they aren't the most convenient and easy company I have dealt with for returns.I can only assume that the A9 Pro must be screwed up in some way by the manufacturer. For this to have sent me two phones in a row both with serious hardware problems, I highly recommend STAY AWAY from this model."", 'This is a good phone for the price.  The phone feels solid and I love the green color.  The included case is a nice touch.  The phone comes with Android 10...I wish it came with at least Android 11 since it was just released. I also like that it was not filled with bloatware.  The apps that were installed were minimal like YouTube, Gmail, Google Drive and just a few others part of the Android/Google ecosystem.  Installation of additional apps worked great this time...some other Umidigi phones seem to ""stall"" when apps were installed from the Google Play store, but the A9 Pro installed them without any lags. I use the phone as a spare and mainly for watch streaming services and the phone does great in that area.  Everything seems zippy and responsive.  I did notice that the camera was a bit ""slow"" when taking pictures in low light.  Other than, this phone serves the purposes I need at a good price for an updated phone. Also, the phone works great on T-Mobile network.', 'I love this phone and it has helped me get a lot of things done, however there are some issues that I have dealt with where my Bluetooth headphones get a weird static noise when using them in tandem with this phone.

Also has all the bands for LTE connection that many other Chinese brands don't have.

Just a rip off if you ask me I found this out when I checked in the settings ""About Phone"". The phone continued to freeze up with a black screen and was dropping the wifi signal continuously. Totally disappointed with my purchase, I feel as if I was scammed. I\'m returning this Umi A9pro.', ""I wanted to like this phone. It worked great for about two hours. Then it wouldn't download an app. It got really slow and I think there is a problem with the processor.. So I'm returning it. I think I'll stick with Motorola."", ""I saw this phone and thought I try it out.. and well.. This phone is does the basics..  making calls, taking pictures/videos. The thermometer that is in this phone please don't get too excited, it'll stop working after first time you try it... Bluetooth goes in and out for no reason.  If you want a phone just to watch YouTube videos and  only make calls, take pictures/videos.. that about it.

It\'s very streamlined compared to older rugged phones and even with larger battery and screen, doesn\'t feel bulky/heavy.  I use it with T-mobile, which uses the 4GVoLTE, and the call reception/internet speeds have been great and consistent!  Calls are clear on both ends, but speaker is not very good.  The location on bottom rear makes it hard to hear, especially as hand tends to naturally block it.  Bluetooth, Wifi work as expected.  Cameras are excellent including the Night Vision which is amazing!  The battery life is about 2.5-3days with heavy use, i.e. gaming/movies for several hours a day.  I\'m currently testing normal use, i.e. just calling/texts/pics/etc and am currently on day 5 with ~16% left.  I used wireless charging for first time (10W Qi), which works great, and it takes about 4hrs for full-recharge.  Wired charging was about 2hrs.  So far, very happy with my purchase.**Special point to make is regarding the wireless charging as that was a major fail with other older rugged phones I owned as you had to always plug it in and remove the waterproofing cap/cover every time which  caused it to breakoff early on every phone rendering the ruggedness null.', ""I had the S90pro last time around, was a good phone until the cat dumped water on it while it was charging.  This one so far is the same size physically, so I'm used to it.  I think the screen resolution was a touch better on the 90.  The camera on the 96 is superior so far. Other sites suggested downloading a different camera app to really take advantage of the hardware. I haven't yet since I'm not a picture taking fool.  I still wish the tough phones would put the speaker on the front like I had on my old Duraforce. To me, that's about the only complaint with the newer designs.This phone is no different although the one speaker is pretty loud.  I have noticed the screen sensitivity is different at times, mostly at the unlock screen though.  A few times the screen remains black when a phone call comes in, but I think that has been when I've been outside in the cold.  Still not cool that it happens though.  Battery lasts several days.  The night vision camera works pretty good for a gimmick.  Processor is faster than anything I would need it for. The screen protectors that are included are the plastic style, not glass, so they will get scratched up.  Would I buy it again? Probably.

I should preface all of this by saying, I did work for a cell phone store previously and am currently a technologist, so I'm quite familiar with this kind of stuff.  So, I downloaded some third party apps to help resolve this.  Using a third party app that ran on a VoIP, whatsapp, facebook messenger, etc. did help with the no ringing issue, but that was only because they used their own notification system.  The native calling notification, I was never able to figure out.  Do not disturb settings were checked, along with some other timeout setting, auto retrieve, volume, etc.  All ok.  Third party messaging apps were the same.  If the application utilized it's own notification system, we were ok, but something that used the native notification system did not work either.

I love the price and the big screen. But the stylus is very basic. It is not a samsung series note10 or 20 . Motorola need to improve the stylus by a huge margin. Package arrived as expected and item was very neatly packaged with bubble wrap.', 'Update September 25th 2022: this battery is garbage. Today I use the phone to navigate for miles. I did about a half an hour of surfing the web and the battery went from 100% to 43% just like that. Huge bummer. Hope it lasts till Christmas.I was looking for an inexpensive phone for myself and then another one to purchase for my mother. After being unsuccessful with another slightly more expensive phone that did not operate properly I came upon the reviews for this phone and decided to give it a shot.I would say so far mostly good. Right out of the box the talk to text works much more smoothly than Samsung a53. There\'s a lot more on the keyboard for this phone so I find myself getting a little lost trying to figure out how to get the keyboard to come back etc but generally it\'s been easier to operate and I appreciate that the microphone and the keyboard can be displayed simultaneously.The fingerprint reader is fairly worthless, almost never works but I have a very sturdy case it can making it tricky to jam your finger in there. Seems like maybe not the best idea to have it where it is and then you end up limited to only using your right hand so not so great for lefties like me.Battery life is okay. I\'m satisfied with that. It seems to go down to 80% pretty quick but that range in between 80% and it\'s when it\'s below 50 seems like it takes a little longer. I had hoped it would be better and it seemed to be better the first few weeks but capacity may have gone done significnatly in a short time. Also noticed that the charging cable and block charges slowly but if I put on my old pixel changer it is rapid charging, not sure why it wouldn\'t be the other way around.As another reviewer mentioned, on the Verizon network you might have a little trouble receiving texts. I did it first, I didn\'t do anything to change it except for one of the updates that I was prompted to do and then suddenly they came in. I\'ll keep an eye on that. I\'m going to try and update as I discover more about this phone. I will say in general getting around on this phone is a little trickier than my old pixel XL. Like trying to go back seems to only happen with a swipe to the right. Trying to toggle between different apps was also tricky. What I figured out was that you have to go into settings, navigation and then turn off gestures to get the three buttons at the bottom for back, reduce app, and then to show all open apps..Also trying to get my apps that I do not have icons on the screen for yet is a little tricky... Seems like if you start swiping from 3/4 down the screen and up you will get them which is too similar to swiping from all the way at the bottom of the screen which does something totally different. Trying to get the app icons onto the home screen into a shared bubble is almost like a video game. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn\'t.Update- this was fixed with system update: Something that\'s starting to happen that\'s concerning me is that I\'m realizing it\'s rebooting and updating software nightly. Tonight it did it twice and wakes me up at 1:00 a.m. and then again it almost two with ""hello Moto""after it\'s done updating. I don\'t know why it needs such frequent updates and I\'m beginning to think it\'s a bit of a glitch. This would be the second phone that I had from Amazon in a row that seems glitchy so I\'m not sure if these phones are new or used and refurbished. Hopefully these are all about some setting I need to figure out how to adjust.', ""The price was great and after all the updates were installed it worked well for most uses. Call quality is great, text works good, decent camera along with too much Google like most android phones. Fingerprint reader on the side button is almost flawless and convenient. Screen is large but not the brightest or sharpest but fine for me. Sound is clear but not very loud but meets my needs fine. At the price point of $150, it's a great phone. If yoi're on a budget, it's a solid buy."", ""I just needed to upgrade my phone. I used to have a moto g7 plus and it was starting to freeze, glitch, and was lacking storage space. I deleted hundreds of media files, pictures, apps, and backed up downloads, but no matter my efforts, my phone was still low on storage. It also said that my phone was susceptible to viruses (like every piece of technology is) so I downloaded an anti-virus software, a VPN, and a number of other apps that had reviews promising to fix the problem, but it didn't do anything for me. An upgrade was my last option.This newer moto is so much better! It includes a stylus, a better camera, more storage space, and it accepts the sim card from my previous moto so it was a steal. I'm still waiting on the case, but I got the camera and screen protector and they work like a charm. Everything was included and I was able to transfer all of my apps, backgrounds, and backed up photos and contacts from my last phone without any trouble. I still have to sign into everything and remember passwords, but luckily I found a notepad app that backed up all my passwords to the cloud so that isn't a problem either.I'm still waiting to see if the 2 day battery holds up. So far from what I've seen, the battery drains pretty fast. It goes down about 2% every 5 minutes. I haven't charged the phone since I unpackaged it, but the rate that the battery is draining isn't very promising.Despite that one minor setback, the phone is great and has worked perfectly for everything else. It's so much more refreshing to have a phone that will take pictures without glitching and deleting them or can open websites without completely exiting google and sending me to my home screen.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. I hope this phone has a couple of years in it so I don't have to upgrade again any time soon.Edit: the phone goes through a software update every single night and I have to restart it every single morning. I thought I would wait to see if it only updated because of all the new sign ins and media I had to add, but it hasn't stopped. I'm not too unhappy because updates aren't bad, it's just getting frustrating having to constantly restart the phone and wait for the update to finish before I can use my phone for the day. Which also means some of my alarms get delayed and it's mildly inconvenient."", ""Like: great visuals, crisp colors, fast response. Click on an icon or a website and you're there NOW! Has all of the motion features I like: chop to turn the flashlight, twist wrist to access the camera, etc. Especially good is the wireless app and data transfer feature. Moto learned a lesson from the iphones. All my data and most of my apps were transferred over from my old phone, except a couple. Like most Motos it is feature rich. The stylus is ok, but more of a gimmick to me than really useful, but others may like it. The fingerprint feature is great!Dislikes; the battery started out as long lasting (about 2 days) but now it's less than 24 hours. Granted, it may be that I spent a LOT of time tweaking it to my liking, and I DO spend a lot of time on it, but still, I had to recharge it after only 18 hours use this morning. Pretty bad for a phone that touted a 2 day battery. Also, the phone automatically downloaded a plethora of security and OS updates. It now runs on Android 11. That took a couple of days for Cricket and Moto update their systems. Geez!I'm not going to return it. Even with the dismal battery life, it's still better than my Samsung A02S. It remains to be seen if the battery life improves after all of the setup activity is done"", 'Moto G Stylus 2021 is a great ""Budget"" phone and it performs and look slightly better than its prequel Moto G Stylus from last year. I have both phones and like them very much. You should strongly consider this phone if you don\'t need NFC, 5G, and AMOLED, and high price tag.Now there is catch. Apparently Verizon is moving away from 3G. When it\'s 3G network will be shutdown completely is still to be determined by the company. Somehow, Motorola also decided to remove the 3G CDMA radio from the new Moto G Stylus 2021 phone. As such, you may not be able to receive text messages if you are on the Verizon network. The solution is simply to call Verizon to add ""CDMA-less"" feature to your line. Once that is done, everything will be using LTE afterwards.The chat feature in the Messages app can also affect the phone to receive incoming messages from the users also have the chat feature enabled on their phones. Make sure the chat feature is successfully connected if you have it enabled in your new phone. The Messages\' chat feature is a Google thing and is similar to Apple\'s iMessage.Also if you\'re going to use the same SIM card from your previous phone, make sure to disable the chat feature before you remove the SIM card from your previous phone. Without doing so will cause the chat feature to fail to connect in your new phone. According to the chat feature FAQ, it may take up to 8 days before the system to disassociate the chat feature from your previous phone. Luckily there is a portal (check the FAQ) you can go to force the chat feature to be disassociated from your previous phone. But it will still take some time (an hour or two) for the chat feature on your new phone to be successfully connected.', 'Really good value.  Stylus isn\'t just for doodling either.  It\'s nice to have for web browsing if you have fat fingers because you can easily tap the right link the first time every time.Of course, as ""value oriented"" offering, this phone doesn\'t quite have it all.  For instance it lacks wireless charging and NFC.  While it has a good-sized battery and USB-C charging, lack of the latest fast charging protocols means it won\'t fill that battery as quickly as many others.  And while I know the Snapdragon 678 processor is generally fine, it only has 4GB of RAM behind it, so if you\'re a power user, some of your apps and tabs will die in the background and have to reload.  And depending on what you do and how often you backup, 128 GB might be limiting, or it might be fine.Overall, the two biggest ""sore thumb"" sticking points that non-nerds should consider about this phone are the lack of wireless charging (you can still plug in, but if you\'re used to it, it\'s a step backwards), and especially the lack of NFC, which is not a new protocol and is needed for apps that do things like opening hotel doors and other electronic locks, and for contactless pay by phone schemes like Google Pay.  For many, especially if you work a job that makes use of NFC locks and tags, no NFC might be the deal-breaker.If you can overlook those two (glaring in 2021) omissions, and don\'t need 5G yet (and you probably don\'t for a few more years), this the 2021 Moto G Stylus is a powerhouse at its price point.', 'This is a nice phone. It\'s much bigger than my moto g7. I need two hands to text when I\'m not using the one-handed feature. Camera is good, I don\'t have difficulty focusing it like I did on the g7. The fingerprint sensor on the power button is very sensitive. I\'m hoping it will stay that way. I think having it on the power button is better than having it on the back because I\'m not constantly touching it. The battery life is not the full 2 days that the listing claims it is. I\'ve been using it for about 2.5 hours and it\'s already at 65% (watching videos, reading, messaging). Set-up was easy, transferring my sim card to this phone was hassle free. I like that it comes with the pin you use to open the slot for the sim card. The stylus is fun to play with. It writes well, I haven\'t had any trouble with it. I think this is a great cell phone, especially for the price. However, I fell for the ""2 day battery life"" part and it\'s not entirely accurate. It is a quick charge though.', ""The biggest single phone manufacturer in the world, the one that's phones start with a vowel got caught intentionally slowing down their phones when a new generation of phones comes out, seemingly to inspire people to buy the newest one. No one could say how many phone manufacturers do such a thing, but I know that moto phones do get slow and glitch out after about a year of use, like clockwork. New, old, it doesn't matter. A year after activation they just struggle, almost like they want you to buy a new phone.Knowing that your moto phone will only last about a year, at least you hope for good while it's new. This phone is adequate in every way, except the battery. In no way, is this a 2 day battery. Even with light use, there's no way to get 2 days out of this phone. I don't believe you could get 16 hours out of this phone at total rest. Keep a charger nearby, and a power bank. Other than that, it's okay... For now."", 'Look people there is no need to spend thousands on the popular top of the line smartphones currently vying for your business when you have a company like Motorola that combines affordability and the latest technology in their current smartphones. When Motorola has a new device ready I am usually first inline to purchase, test, review the latest phone. I have purchased over twenty smartphones from the Motorola Line-up and with each new iteration I find they compete nicely with the ""overpriced"" trendy smartphones at a fraction of the cost. The stylishness, fit and finish give the phone a classic modern look and feel of their more expensive competitors. Motorola\'s customer service is second to none as I incurred an issue with one of the products that I purchased ""used"" but it was still in warranty. I was able to converse live with a technical support person and they sent me a brand new replacement no questions asked. That was my first experience having to return a smartphone other than self damaging some iPhones I previously owned.  I highly recommend trying their phones and this version was a perfect example of the technological strides that Motorola has made in an effort to compete in the ever expanding smartphone marketplace.']"

I always wanna buy another S21 Ultra 5G with Snapdragon for different user experience. I am glad that I bought it at the right price. Both S21 Ultra 5G with Snapdragon and Exynos are my dream phones.I love them, great display, excellent camera, marvelous battery, and all other splendid features!', ""It's hard to know where to really begin with reviewing this phone, because everything about it is simply amazing! But here goes:Build Quality & Design: So I was at first a bit apprehensive about the curved display because I wasn't sure how I would feel about it (every other phone I've had had a flat display), but the curve is subtle enough that it's very easy to get used to and actually adds a bit to the ergonomics of the design. The color looks just as stunning in person as it does in photos and the overall design of the phone looks incredible. The phone feels sturdy and the buttons have a very satisfying click to them and the fingerprint sensor has a great placement and works wonderfully.Display: The 1440p, 120Hz, display on this phone lives up to its reputation of being the best display you can get on a smartphone in 2021. The colors are vibrant and punchy, the clarity is top-notch, the high refresh rate (variable) really makes the phone feel snappy and quick. The touch sensitivity is also great and never feels like I have to put too much effort into moving around the UI.UI: I was a bit apprehensive of One UI as I hadn't used a Samsung phone since the Galaxy S4 (and the days of the old TouchWiz) and I have been using Pixel/Nexus phones for the last 6 years. I have been pleasantly surprised, though, by how much it retains the core functionalities of stock Android while adding in features that are actually more useful than I would have guessed they would be (having Google One feed to the left of the homescreen is a great addition by Samsung). From the ease of connecting Samsung peripherals (I have Galaxy Buds+ and a Galaxy Watch 3) to the extended screenshot feature to the baked in screen record and everything in between, Samsung has really matured in their UI to now offer a lot of useful add ons while limiting the unnecessary bloat.Battery: This is the first phone I've had where I really can feel confident that my battery is going to last me the full day if I'm going to be out and about and away from the charger. Even with full 1440p and 120Hz enabled, I'm easily able to achieve 5 to 6 hours of screen on time with roughly 20 to 24 hours of total battery endurance. On days that I don't push the phone as hard, I can get up to 8 or even 9 hours of screen on time and up to 2 days of overall battery endurance. Only on days that I'm scrolling through videos on TikTok, taking a lot of photos and videos, and really just having the screen on all day do I need to charge it even a little before the day is up (and even then getting it to even 50% is enough to give me confidence for hours).Camera: My last phone was a Google Pixel 3XL which, at the time, was basically the leading smartphone camera and could produce amazing shots every time. I wouldn't say that this camera is as consistently and easily good, but the potential for great shots is even greater with this phone. Occasionally I have to take a few different shots to get the one that I want, but when I get what I want, it looks incredible. And this applies to all of the cameras, which brings me to the second point ... The variety of cameras here makes the experience wonderful. I'll frequently take 3 or 4 different shots utilizing all of the cameras to gain different perspectives and image profiles and nearly every time I get impressive photos from every lens (yes, even the 10x zoom camera can pull off pretty stunning imagery). The camera is definitely a high point for this camera, but you do need to be willing to work with it a bit more than you would on a Pixel or iPhone which are better quick point and shoot cameras, but lack some of the diversity of use that you can get with the Galaxy S21 Ultra.Conclusion: Overall, this phone is just incredible from top to bottom and is by far the best phone that I've ever owned. I would recommend this to anyone that is willing to pay a bit more for a premium device."", ""So I spent nearly 3 weeks reviewing the Note 20 ultra this phone and the S22 Ultra comparing everything I could watching videos ect. I ultimately went with this over the S22 just because there was a lot of complaints with the S22. I've had this phone for just over a month now, and my first impressions on it are somewhat lower than I was hoping for. All of my feelings toward the s21 Ultra are based off of my prior experience with the Note 10+ which I switched over from after I cracked the screen. I figured 2.5 years was a damn good run for it.The Bad:  So to start things off I noticed right out of the starting gate that he battery life isn't quite as good as my Note 10's was and it tends to get a little hot, however it's not horrible I still average a day to a day and a half if I let it go all the way dead. Next thing I was a little sad to see the micro sd slot removed, as I've liked having a removable memory card for backing up stuff just incase. I strongly feel not including a charging block is just a cash grab, but we won't get into that lol. The finger print reader was something a lot of video breakdowns raved about, however I feel its pretty bad. I only have my thumbs set for all 4 scans and more times than not it still can't pick it up. Size is somewhat bulkier, primarily due to the raised camera overlay, which results in the case being somewhat bulkier. Again not horrible but the Note 10+ was just so much slimmer and more comfortable in the hand. Lastly the cost. I bought my Note directly from Samsung for $700 brand new with a pair of galaxy buds and a charger included, so at $1200 this phone should have outperformed my 2.5 year old Note across the board, but to be quite honest its mediocre at best.The Good:  So even with all the ranting there is some good with this phone. To start things off the camera has some nice new features. The fact that you can zoom in 100x is pretty impressive, even though at that distance any picture looks like it was taken with a potato. The camera also has a laser auto focus which is pretty interesting to watch in video, the camera will literally adjust to movement without you actually moving. You can notice some slight rendoring differences comparing to the Note 10+ but nothing crazy. Pretty much the only key differences is the Laser Focus and the higher zoom and telephoto capabilities. Next I can say the overall functionality is almost Identical to the Note 10+ aside from slightly faster operating when it's in 120 hz, so you will notice slightly faster touch response at times. Last but not least the memory on this thing is pretty much on par with the Note 10, both feature a 12gb chip of RAM which is just ridiculous for a phone, so with good internet connection both phones can run videos or games with ease.Conclusion:  To be honest the phone is nice, I can't say it isn't. It does everything I'd need it to do and a bit more. However when comparing it to my old phone that had a hard 2.5 years of life filled with dusty environments and plenty of drops, it still averaged a full day of battery and fairly decent operation speeds and functions. I just don't know If I could recommend this phone, if you have an older generation Note (9,10,20) I would honestly probably say to save your money. However If you are in the same boat as I was and need to upgrade due to it being damaged it isn't a bad phone to go with. That being said I'd almost say it's worth looking into just having your current phone repaired. All in all the phones good, It suites my needs, but it seems more like an Android Iphone with everything it lacks at this point. I hope maybe Samsung will can make some better improvements in future models, but I guess only time will tell. I'd say I've rambled enough though, thanks for reading hopefully my input can help someone make a decision on which way to go."", ""I upgraded from the Galaxy s8 to the S21 Ultra with 256 gb of storage and 12gb of ram. I will start off by saying go with the Ultra or the base, you pay $200 extra for half an inch of screen on the plus (this is called decoy price, you see this at movies where the popcorn medium is only 1 dollar less than the large, but is 3 more than the small, so you might as well go large.)I'll give more detial at the end.Camera is super high quality, zoom is incredible. Front camera even takes good pics (I mean I looked good, so should you)Processor is as advertised, insanely fast, even at the standard limited benchmark (there is an enhanced processing mode to take away cpu 70% limit). Desktop mode is great, this phone is almost as fast in Dex as my actual Acer laptop.Battery life is phenomenal, can get 2 full days out of 1 charge if you use the phone less than 4 or 5 hours a day at 1080p res.1440p, super clear and one of the bargaining point for the Ultra over the base. The refresh rate of 120 hz is incredible, I spent the first 10 minutes just swiping on the phone in awe of this. The ultra is also the only version with the curved screen,, the s21 and plus have flat screens.. This phone does an excellent job of cooling, even witha case on. (FYI heat causes the major wear and tear on the internal components like the cpu, so better cooling means better lifespan and performance).Customizable routines allow you to add features to your phone, from automatically silencing when you show up to work or school, automatically going into power save mode at certain times like when you are asleep, or even for when you turn on your Bluetooth headphones your phone can automatically switch to 1440p resolution and turn Dolby atmos on movie mode sound. Dozens of scenarios or time stamps for each feature.If you are the friend that walks on the grass, don't worry about bringing that bulky charger for when your friends' phones are about to die, this phone can wireless charge other devices (will stop charging when the phone drops to 30% minimum).If you are concerned about no color options, just remember, I had that beautiful orchid gray s8, and who got to see it? Nobody, because it was hidden behind a lovely teal case for 4 years.If the fact that Samsung dropped their charging from the 45w of the s20 series to a 25w for the s21, rest assured, there is very little added time for charging, and the 25w is less volatile than the 45w. This means, charging does not get the phone as hot, and the battery will have a better lifespan since slower charging is better long term.If you multi task a ton and/or save tons of files, consider spending the extra money to get the 512 gb edition, as it comes with an additional 4gb of ram (16gb total).Ram is what is used to have tabs open, so more ram means more tabs open while still maintaining speed and smoothness. The s21 ultra also has Spen support (need a case that can hold it).Why the ultra or base and not the plus?The s21 has a better ppi (pixel density, higher the density, better the picture) than the s21 plus. They both have the same 8gb of ram, the same storage sizes, same resolution, same cameras, same material, same flat screen, the same backwards wireless charging capability (same for ultra), etc. The only difference is the screen size and that the s21 plus has a 4800 mAh battery while the s21 has a 4000 mAh. The ultra however, offers higher resolution, much higher ppi, the larger screen, larger battery than both (5000mAh). The ultra has much more powerful camera as well, the curved screen, camera features and settings. So if you want all the features and performance and screen resolution (I like the stream movies  on my lunch breaks) then go with the Ultra, if you just want to upgrade to the newest and fastest phone, and you don't need to have 100000 tabs open, get the base s21."", ""My device arrived in perfect new condition. Set up was easy, and I found getting everything organized natural. I decided to write a review to give some important things to know from the power users point of view. I have used the device for about 1 week now.First, some background. I work on consumer electronics professionally. This means I'm absolutely a power user. Other reviewers cover the basics better, so I'm going to focus on those details that power users would really want to know but have a hard time finding before buying.I'll start with the bad. Samsung completely dropped the ball on two important features: visual voicemail and RCS messaging.The former only works if you have a carrier app that supports it. The built-in dialer has no support for visual voicemail whatsoever, and if you install the Google dialer, Samsung's modifications prevent it from accessing visual voicemail services on my carrier. If you care about visual voicemail, and your carrier doesn't provide a carrier specific app, then you're out of luck. In my opinion, this is the biggest downside of the phone: Samsung software. If I knew that visual voicemail wasn't officially supported without a carrier application, I wouldn't have bought this phone. I'm on Mint Mobile where no carrier application is available, meaning I just don't have this feature on a premium flagship phone. That's a fail. I expect this feature standard in the premium segment.For RCS messaging, support in their SMS app is strangely absent for this latest model phone. Even if you install Google Messages and Carrier Services, it activates, but I was never able to successfully send an RCS message.As a power user, I like running the latest Android software. Samsung is getting better about this, but the updates will lag Pixel phones. Samsung is on the right track offering 3 years of software support followed by an additional fourth year of security updates.If you like Android tunables, this is the phone for you. You can control everything from high-speed battery charging levels vs cycle count to detailed power savings restrictions applied to each app. You can control the kind of network you connect to using what technology, and you can even view networks in your area from other carriers that aren't yours! I really like having this degree of control over the phone. It almost makes up for the lack of visual voicemail.Snapdragon 888 performance is the best at any price for Android. Although it doesn't challenge the king of mobile silicon performance, Apple, performance remains excellent with the new X1 prime core. This phone can play anything beautifully and will not leave you wanting more.Reverse wireless charging and the ability to output to a full size display over HDMI are as niche as they are wonderfully geeky. I love the idea that I could use this phone as my only computer.The indisplay fingerprint reader is fast and responsive. I have applied a glass display protector, and it still works if you recalibrate your fingerprints and increase display sensitivity. It's just not as responsive. I'm of the opinion that the back of the device is the best place to put a fingerprint reader or on the power button. With that said, the solution works.Battery life is genuinely all day. It's definitely not two day battery life, but I end the day using my phone actively for much of it with some power to spare. The battery size for this phone is just right.Camera is spectacular. It's better than my own eyes. I'll leave this one to the photographers. I love the AI powered scene recognition; it's helped me take some unbelievable shots.Overall: a premium device with strange omissions and cool niche features. I like the phone, but I question the manufacturer's priorities at times. You shouldn't have to compromise at this price. With that said, this is pretty cool phone that will please many users."", 'Pros:Industry-leading processing power and firmware.Long firmware support life.Excellent battery life.Super nice display.Charges fast.Great speakers.Great glass used for the display and back.Should be more resistant to damage, in comparison to other Samsung phones (re: s20 FE) which use the brittle Gorilla Glass 3. And even if you break it, Samsung is the Honda of phones. Parts are always cheap, readily available, and as such repairs are cheaper and easier to access.Looks good while doing all of the above.Cons:The fingerprint reader is abysmal. I\'m coming from a Razer Phone 2 which read and recognized my fingerprints near instantaneously, and very reliably. Sometimes this thing just refuses to recognize my prints, or takes a good second or so to do anything about it.This camera is years behind what it was hyped up to be. On my RP2 I was running a Gcam mod and generally getting better results, ESPECIALLY in night mode. I was kind of gutted when I discovered how inferior this camera array is. Lots of noise on the wide angle, tons of focus hunting regardless of which lens you\'re using, just generally primitive by today\'s standards. Is it a hardware issue or a software issue? No idea, but it\'s unacceptable either way. Do NOT buy this phone for the cameras. Many cameras from a few years ago are better, especially with Gcam.The display, while beautiful, has pretty terrible viewing angles. Yet another problem I thought we left back in 2015.RAM is silly low, even by flagship standards from 2-3 years ago.Meh:Samsung is still lagging behind stock android in many ways. There are a lot of redundant and pointless apps/""features"" that are clearly just Samsung trying to trick you into giving THEM your data, rather than Google; and doing it poorly. Customization is somehow better and worse than ROMs which are closer to stock. Sammy put a few decent features in here for customizing, but not really anything you couldn\'t have gotten from a 3rd party. The launcher is terrible and restricting, but easy to replace. I personally use Microsoft Launcher with a bunch of 3rd party widgets, icon packs, etc.Conclusion:At the end of the day, this is a matter of price. When this phone was released for around $1k, it was insanely overpriced and not at all worth it. However, I snagged it on Prime Day for $699. At that price, I feel like it BARELY scapes past acceptable. $100 more than that and I would have returned it and waited to see what comes out later this year from other mfgs. The s21 line is bizarre to me. It blends top of the line features and tech with relatively archaic features and tech. I would not call this a flagship series, except in that Samsung does not have a higher-tiered line. This could have been much more polished, and it\'s sad they cut corners and had some critical oversights. But again, if you can get this for almost half of what it cost at launch retail, it\'s worth it. Don\'t expect bleeding edge performance across the board, and you should be satisfied.', 'A loved one owns one and absolutely loved it', 'On of the best phones I have and still using. Still handles tasks super easy and powerful camera as well.', ""It has been years since I've had a Samsung phone. The last one that I owned was an S4. Since then, I have avoided them like the plague. The software experience of the old TouchWiz ran me off and kept me away.In recent years I've heard more and more about how much better one UI is so I decided after all of these years, and in the lack of a pixel flagship, to give the S21 Ultra a shot. Things have greatly improved compared to those days of TouchWiz but nevertheless the incredible hardware that Samsung builds is still completely devastated by their disappointing software.Surprisingly, this time around I have very little problem with the overall UI. I have managed to work around most of the problems that I did have. For example, I can't stand the horizontally scrolling app drawer so I switched launchers and as usual with Android that's no big deal. I've removed or disabled most of the extraneous Samsung apps that can be removed or disabled and the rest can be ignored. Bixby can be remapped to Google Assistant for the most part but Bixby routines for hardware control are pretty useful. Most of the UX ranges from perfectly fine to really good.Unfortunately, where the software really really falls short is where this phone is meant to shine. The Galaxy camera software is bloated beyond usability and largely unable to take a usable photo of anything that either moves or is in low light. The S21 Ultra, in particular, is more of a camera than a phone but the software that you have to use for the camera part of it simply doesn't work well enough to use in many cases.If you want to take a photo of a landscape or a building or a car in broad daylight it will come out looking amazing. If you want to take a photo of a child or a pet playing in the Sun it probably won't work. If you want to take a photo of something in a little like then it probably won't work.It seems unable to take a photo of a moving object without motion blur even in broad daylight. When it does manage to take one then it misses the focus and focuses on some random thing in the background rather than the moving subject. Along those same lines, it is unable to focus at all in many cases in the dark.The camera app spends so much for the phones processing power trying to present you with an image in the viewfinder that looks better than the final photo will that it can't actually take the photo when you press the button. Instead of understanding your button press to mean take the photo now the phone interprets it as a request to take the photo at some point in the future. If you shutter lag is immense and it is real.This is all an entirely software problem. I know this because when I use a port of the Google camera the phone produces amazing photos in nearly all scenarios. Unfortunately, you are unable to use the Google camera ports using Hardware shortcuts to launch the camera if the phone is locked which makes this solution unusable.Fortunately, many of the problems with the Samsung camera software seem to be slowly getting resolved. The June update has made massive strides to improving the shutter lag. If they continue on this trajectory then the S21 Ultra camera might be usable by the time the s22 ultra gets released and then they can start all over again.Moving off of the camera, my only other real problem with the device is the fingerprint sensor. Under screen fingerprint sensors are both unnecessary and poorly functioning. Don't get me wrong, the fingerprint sensor works fine without a screen protector or with a film screen protector. However, this is a $1,200 7-in slab of glass that I carry with me all day, everyday. It needs more protection than a simple film screen protector. It needs a glass screen protector but they simply don't work well enough with the fingerprint sensor.I've tried multiple glass screen protectors for this phone and none of them work with another fingerprint sensor. Even the $50 ones that are applied using liquid adhesive and cure under UV light don't work reliably with the fingerprint sensor. They work sort of, but not well enough to rely on. With them in place, the fingerprint sensor is unable to read your finger properly in most situations. It will eventually get it if you try three or four or 15 times but you can't expect it to get it on the first try and that is unacceptable.Just put the fingerprint sensor on the back so that we can please use the phone with proper protection.The fingerprint sensor is the only Hardware problem that I have with this device. The camera software is my primary software complaint. Unfortunately, on a $1,250 phone those two complaints are significant enough to run me off and keep me away again. They are also significant enough to knock a five-star review down to two.I can't wait for the Pixel 6 release, I want a different phone."", 'The King of android  phones!!Powerful, great screen and battery life,,great price to,thanks amazon!!']"

The support went as far as providing me the images to flash the broken phone to stock for a return.This phone is perfect for the paranoid prepper type. I'm a former (and now reserve) Grunt who works cyber security on the civilian side. I want max privacy on a simple platform and usually carry UHF radios anyway. You know, just in case.This does all of that (especially I you put LineageOS on it) and is small enough to use with one hand.My only gripe (other than the first phone being broken on the hardware side) is the gaudy colors and dim display. The colors are great for civilian purposes and not loosing the phone, but sometimes you're not trying to be seen."", 'En principio el móvil parece bueno pero al descargar la aplicación google pay (wallet) y querer introducir mi tarjeta bancaria para pagos contactless usando NFC me sale el siguiente error en pantalla:  ""no puedes utilizar este teléfono para pagar en tiendas, esto puede deberse a que esté rooteado o haya sido manipulado"". Por desgracia he tenido que devolverlo.', ""Pros:-1/2-mile range on short range radio between phones-Battery life: 2-4 days-Android OS-Small but beefy profile w/ lanyard loop-Aux jackCons:-Dull screen-Basic UI-Basic camera software-No network guaranteeAverage:-Bluetooth seems to work-Spare, programmable button (Bixby button without Bixby)-Camera hardware-4G works on my CDMA networkI enjoy the half-mile reach of the short range radio on this phone. You can map it to the spare button, but a con is that there is no way to quickly switch between radio button mode and shortcut mode. You have to go into settings, intelligent assistance, and toggle the switch every time. Other reviews will tell you all about the radio.I also enjoy the long battery life of the phone, compared to other modern offerings. I get 2-3 days of normal Snapchatting, reading the news, and general time wasting. The Intercom (SR radio app) says it sucks battery but it only amounts to 2-5% extra per half hour. When I go to sleep, my Samsung Galaxy S8 loses 20-30% by morning but this phone has only lost 5-10%. My partner likes to use the battery-saving options and can get 4 days. This is good because she forgets to charge her phone.My biggest gripe is that this phone is straight out of 2010. I never realized how much more useful Samsung makes their interfaces until I used this one. It has everything Android OS offers, but that means you miss convenient menu layouts, options, and sophistication.The screen is bluish and dull. Granted, nothing looks pixelated, even when I look closely, and maybe the cheaper screen helps with battery life.The touch screen works fine. I took off the lamination.The screen itself is about the size of an iPhone 4, but the body is a brick. I haven't dropped it on concrete yet, so I don't know if the apparent ruggedness is real. It does have a lanyard slot, which is why I haven't dropped it yet. Just be aware that there is an extra half inch of phone thay they conceal in the product pictures due to the chamfered back edge. See above pics.I don't notice any hiccups due to the older processor. I don't play any shooters, but do use Maps, play strategy games, and multitask many apps at a time.The camera is indeed 48 MP, but when compared to my 12MP S8, it is apparent that the only difference is a more fish eyed lense, not image density. That is, the extra pixels go towards making the picture larger, not any clearer. The camera interface is spartan. You get video, normal, time lapse, and pro modes. No software to account for image color, and no actual gallery app (I use Google Photo, out of necessity). There are not any super, free camera apps on Play Store. I'm not expecting Google Pixel saturation, but judge for yourself; I took the above photos with this camera.All in all, it's a well-priced, no-frills alternative phone. I haven't been fined, so it seems their radio zoning by country is helpful and effective. User beware that literally no phone company will guarantee that it works on their network, but I swapped in my US Cellular sim card and it works fine on their home CDMA network (haven't roamed yet). If you don't care about the radio, I'd skip the Atom L and just get a regular, cheap phone. I may still go back to the S8 and buy a Baofeng (RIP my battery life)."", ""I had taken the phone on various excursions Climbing, kayaking, and cycling. I was happy with its robust nature and photographs. I did have calling problems from about 18months onward.Phone started jumping screens texting and phoning others after two years.

It was a good phone I just wish it had lasted longer"", ""I brought this phone because I normally carry my handheld radio and my phone around so I'm getting two for the price of one.Problems are the radio chews right into the Battery and you get less than 6 hours with the radio on standby.The LCD screen has terrible ghosting although it is not permanent it is really annoying when you can see your keyboard on a photograph.If you want to use the phone to listen to Bluetooth headphones don't buy it. I've used Sony and bose and JBL and all of them have intermittent breaking up of the music.Also connecting to a car Bluetooth hands-free is a big no-no.People have upgraded this phone to Android 11 and have had problems with Wi-Fi and several other things.Before you buy why have a look around the internet at some of the forums especially on Facebook people are having murder with these phones.It is quite a shame because the idea is fantastic"", ""It feels amazing and the build quality is amazing and it's android 10, that's the positive.The negative.If you want to use this as a full on DMR/Analogue radio with Zello, Echolink, DVSwitch, Peanut, Droidstar etc then forget it get a Inrico S200 or S200 etc.Reason why is the Ptt is mappable to use with all but there is a huge downside.You can not allow the PTT to work on all apps say at once, you have to physically close the app goto settings open ptt settings select next app you want to use close settings open the app to use.Sorry this isn't good enough if Inrico and others can allow the button to be mapped to all without conflict to other apps these can.I knew there was going to be an issue when button mapper would not see the hard ware button when mapping.So it's going back and I will be keeping the Inrico S200 and a dedicated Radio for the rest.It could have been so much more of a unit if the Ptt was fully mappable like many out there now."", ""I took a chance on this phone because I wanted a tough phone with a relatively small screen and decent battery life. It replaced an iPhone SE (2016) - which was a far more useful phone to have, in my opinion, despite the terrible battery life towards the end.To start with, despite appearances, this phone is not tough at all. Every time I have dropped it, from just a few feet, the screen has cracked in a new spot. This is with the screen protector that comes with it. After one of the falls, the display also started acting up, giving a kind of weird double screen where the battery life, time, etc from the moment when it fell is still displayed underneath the current info, making it all unreadable. I had my SE for 4 years, dropped it all the time, and it never broke once.The fingerprint reader doesn't work. Or if it does, I haven't been able to use it.Often it just shuts apps like spotify after 10-15 minutes, for no apparent reason. It just seems to give up. Also, it lacks small useful features from the iPhone, such as being able to like/ save a song that comes on without fully unlocking the phone and entering the app. I understand that this is a budget phone and that these things are to be expected, but I didn't realise how annoying I would find it.The camera is terrible, unless the lighting is Perfect, and the subject is 0.5-1 meters away (for stills). The video quality is genuinely awful, think like 2009 phone camera quality. It cannot auto adjust for changes in lighting when things move in or out of frame, meaning that everything gets washed out or is super dark. Everything comes out blurry and very wobbly, unless you're using it on a tripod.It also cannot run strava properly (and I assume other similar GPS tracking-based apps). This isn't necessarily a huge catch, but I would guess that a fair amount of people considering this phone are outdoorsy/ sporty types who might want to factor that in. Once the display turns off it stops the GPS tracking, and you end up with just a straight line from that point to your destination.On the positive side, the battery life is pretty good (although because this phone is so bad I use it less, and I'm sure that does factor into it...). Also, the speaker is very loud. That's about it.Overall I wish I hadn't bought this phone... I am planning to replace it with a refurbished iPhone pretty soon because, and I cannot stress this enough, it kind of sucks."", 'TL;DRThis phone is amazing.  In all reality, the only con is the screen brightness in the sun, but I can deal.  I\'ve been using it for a month or so now alongside Tasker and Lightning Launcher Extreme and couldn\'t be happier.-This phone is possibly the best phone I\'ve ever had.  The fact that it\'s unlocked gives it much more prestige.-It is an incredibly snappy phone.-It fits in my pocket and I can use it comfortably with one hand!-The android update (Android 10) gives it great support with apps.-Using it with the AT&T Bring Your Own Phone sim kit with Straight Talk and the service is awesome.-The smaller screen may seem like a bad thing but you can binge Twitch, YouTube, playing games...anything for hours because the phone has less pixels to push AND it has a decent size battery (4300mAh).-Speaker is nice and loud if you need it to be (usually I don\'t and have it at 50-75% even for alarms and such).-The stock alarms are a great collection of birds chirping, water sounds and noticeable chimes.-The device handles heat very well.  Spent 3 hours driving with it mounted to the windshield while it was hot out and had no AC and the device didn\'t even slow down or drain extra battery while using the GPS.-I\'ve dropped the phone by accident a few times now and the phone hasn\'t seemed to be affected by it.-The quick charge is another awesome thing with this phone AND it uses USB 3(I know a lot of phones have this, but still a great plus).-I\'ve already gotten used to the red ""intelligent button"" on the side and have switched around the actions a little to make using it easier for myself.-The NFC chip is very quick as well.-The Intelligent Assistant has a bunch of great things that give the phone greater quality of life changes such as the app blocker, which has 4 options for EVERY app (Boot Locker, Start Blocker, Background Blocker, and Background Cleanup).  Definitely look into this part of the assistant if you want to maximize your battery life. (I can use my phone regularly for 3 days without having to charge.)-I don\'t have any bluetooth or wifi issues.-I haven\'t used the headphone jack or radio yet.I really can\'t think of any notable cons.  I absolutely love this phone.  If this changes in the future, be sure I\'ll update my review once again.', 'This is a niche product, let’s get that out of the way out of the gate. However, if you are someone who does not like the size of modern phones and have an interest in Radio, be it 446 or Amateur radio, then I think you will be pleased with this device. The phone is good enough to use as a daily driver so long as you’re not a gamer, and having the ability to switch on a DMR enabled UHF radio at any time for a quick chat or just for a listen is priceless. It does do normal analogue too if that’s a question anyone has. Also, the speaker is as loud as any average HT so they even thought of that.Sensitivity is on point and the squelch can be set very low if required, there is no scan function currently or an S-Meter, but as the radio app is software it’s being improved slowly so these functions could come over time. The camera is actually better than I expected but isn’t going to compete with top of the range phones like iPhones and Google pixels in that department but it’s perfectly good at this price point. Battery life is brilliant, the radio app is a big battery drain though so if you use that a day might be all you will get, but if you dip in and out of it as needed two days would be achievable with normal use. Over all, I would happily recommend this device to anyone in the market for such a thing.', 'Ottimo smartphone, tastiera piccola (monitor 4"") ma molto precisa.']"

Ansonsten sind L und XL ja komplett identisch.Mir sind lediglich zwei (für mich) eher kleinere Kritikpunkte aufgefallen die ich weiter unten erläutere.Nutze es jetzt seit 2 Monaten und kann ansonsten bisher von keinen Problemen berichten. Auch keinen von denen Teils von anderen Besitzern berichtet wird (Apps öffnen nicht mehr etc.).Es ist mir 2-3 mal auf den Boden in der Wohnung und im Auto gefallen. Keinerlei technische Probleme und keine Macken. Sicherlich kommt es auch darauf an wie genau es auf dem Boden aufkommt. Daher möchte ich hier nicht zu überschwänglich die Robustheit bewerten.Das Handy ist sehr flott unterwegs und erfüllt meine Erwartungen bisher absolut.Ich wollte ein kleines Handy welches dennoch eine aktuelle Android Version (11 oder 12) besitzt und eine gute Kamera. (die meisten kleinen Smartphones haben nur um die 15 MP und von der Selfie Kamera möcht ich erst gar nicht anfangen)Nach ein paar Wochen Internetrecherche bin ich bei Unihertz gelandet und meiner Meinung nach gibt es auf dem Markt auch keine Alternative (Vergleich Cubot etc.) wenn man oben genannte Wünsche hat und sich in dem günstigen Preissegment bewegen möchte. Ich hätte bis maximal 500€ ausgegeben.Das Atom L hat viele Features die andere Smartphones mit bis zu 5 Zoll Display nicht aufweisen können. Sei es wegen der besagten ganz guten Kamera oder NFC sowie zumindest 4G.Ich habe mit der Internetverbindung bisher noch nie Probleme gehabt und auch das GPS scheint wirklich genau zu sein. Das Handy kommt ohne vorinstallierten App Müll. Außerdem gefällt mir die Möglichkeit sehr präzise alle Aktivitäten von Apps im Hintergrund und beim Start des Handys zu blockieren. Ich denke das ist soviel ich weiß eine Besonderheit des Unihertz Android 11 UI. Dieses Einstellungsmenü geht deutlich weiter als das normale Android 11 App-Einstellungen Menü. Daher auch Vorsicht bei allen Apps die man installiert. Ich habe eine Security und eine E-Mail App sowie eine GPS Tracking App installiert und sie funktionierten nicht im Hintergrund. Ich wunderte mich wieso keine Push-Nachrichten kamen und erst sobald ich die Apps öffnete. Das zeigt die Effektivität der oben besagten ""App-Blockierungsmöglichkeiten"" in den Unihertz Einstellungen. Nach ein bisschen herumprobieren und aktivieren von individuellen Push-Nachrichten im Hintergrund lief alles zuverlässig.Ja das Handy ist etwas schwerer als normale Handys (gerade für seine Größe) aber das stört mich nicht. Ich habe lieber ein kompaktes Handy welches ein wenig schwerer ist und ich in der Hosentasche auch bemerke als umgekehrt. Geschmackssache.Das etwas kleinere Unihertz Jelly 2 schied für mich aus da es erstens nicht alle technischen Features des L aufweisen kann und zweitens waren mir 3 Zoll dann doch etwas zu klein. Ich nutze ab und an Facebook und regelmäßig Instagram. Ich finde 4 Zoll sind wenn man die Schriftgröße in den Systemeinstellungen etwas größer stellt ein sehr guter Kompromiss um die Apps zwischendurch gut nutzen zu können.Ich habe keine riesen Hände aber ich denke mit der Größe der Display Tastatur kann man sehr gut zurechtkommen. Mittlerweile tippe ich sehr schnell und flüssig auf dem etwas kleineren Touchbildschirm als ich es gewohnt war.Der Akku ist super! In den Einstellungen wird das Nutzungsverhalten immer wieder aktualisiert und so wird eine ungefähre Zeit angegeben wie lang der Akku wohl noch halten wird. Bei mir steht dort nicht allzu selten ""länger als 2 Tage"". Selbst mit 50% komme ich noch locker durch einen ganzen Tag und das auch wenn ich mal für 30 Minuten Maps zur Navigation verwende oder ab und zu bei Instagram unterwegs bin. Ein großes Display verbraucht eben auch viel Akku. Der Vorteil von nur 4 Zoll. Für mich war wichtig nicht gezwungen zu sein jeden Tag zwischenladen zu müssen oder auf jeden Fall jede Nacht und wenn ich es mal vergesse steh ich am nächsten Morgen da. Das erfüllt das Atom L Dank der schönen Akkulaufzeit.(Bei Unihertz auf der Website kann man übrigens einen Originalakku nachkaufen. Find ich ganz interessant falls der Akku irgendwann wie jeder Handyakku deutlich an Lebensdauer nachlässt.)Nun zu den zwei negativen Punkten:1. Das Handy hatte eine etwas dickere vorinstallierte Displayschutzfolie. Die musste ab da das Touchdisplay sonst teils bei schnellem tippen auf der Touch Tastatur einige Buchstaben nicht erkannte. Selbst eine Kalibrierung der Touch Sensibilität brachte nur wenig Besserung. Wer generell langsamer tippt hat damit vielleicht keine Probleme. Mich störte es.Jetzt habe ich aktuell gar keine Schutzfolie drauf. Ich passe allerdings auch gut auf das Handy auf und das Gorilla Glass Display ist ja auch schon so sehr gut gegen Kratzer geschützt.2. Verbinde ich Bluetooth mit einem Auto und öffne danach beispielsweise Spotify steigt die Verbindung kurz aus und das Handy sagt die Verbindung wäre unterbrochen. Dann dauert es etwas und eventuell muss man nochmal in die Bluetooth Einstellungen um es erneut zu verbinden. Manchmal verbindet es sich aber von Geisterhand erneut und spielt den Ton dann dennoch sofort ab.Woran es liegt weiß ich nicht und davon berichten wohl auch andere Atom L Nutzer. Also bisher keine Lösung hierfür offenbar.Beide Punkte sind für mich zu verschmerzen und wenn die Bluetooth Verbindung dann steht bleibt es auch dabei und es gibt keine Aussetzer.NFC funktioniert mit Google Pay/PayPal und andern gängigen Bezahl-Möglichkeiten bei mir ohne jegliche Probleme und zügig.Zusammengefasst bin ich froh ein kleines Smartphone für einen erschwinglichen Preis mit hohem Funktions- und Verbindungsumfang (NFC/AUX Anschluss/4G/gute Kameras) bekommen zu haben und bereue den Kauf bisher absolut nicht. Würde es definitiv wieder kaufen.Eine kleine Anmerkung noch. Da es sich um einen Nischen Handyhersteller handelt ist eher nicht davon auszugehen dass es noch ein Update auf Android 12 geben wird oder allgemein noch andere Updates der Software. Aber wer weiß vielleicht irre ich mich ja auch. Nur rechnen sollte man damit eher nicht.Sollten sich in Zukunft noch Fehler und Probleme einstellen werde ich die Rezension definitiv noch updaten!Ich hoffe diese eher lange Rezension kann dem ein oder anderen bei einer Entscheidung PRO oder CON Unihertz Atom L helfen.', 'Ci sono sul web un infinita di ""espertI"" che recensiscono smartphone, ma un prodotto per essere recensito va provato, e scoperto a fondo, io lo fatto e il mio giudizio nel insieme e 9su10 considerando hardware, software, funzioni,robustezza, insieme costruttivo, eventuale miglioramento futuro, e tipologia di smartphone.', 'Cercavo un telefono (android) piccolo e lo trovai e, per il momento (dovessi cambiare idea nei prossimi mesi aggiorno la recensione), lo trovo veramente ottimo.Odio i padelloni, se devo guardare un film o qualsiasi cosa richieda tanto schermo mi porto un tablet o uso il pc. Mi serve un telefono che telefoni, abbia un ottimo GPS (e bussola etc), non mi infastidisca quando lo porto a camminare in montagna e mi possa, quindi, stare in tasca senza problemi.Questo, oltre a tutte le caratteristiche sopra elencate, è pure ""resistente"" e IP68 (ovviamente, non  ho ancora provato ne a farlo cadere ne a immergerlo, ma sono disposto a crederci). Inizialmente pensavo al Jelly 2, ancora più piccolo, ma sono felice di aver speso qualche decina di Eur in più.riassumendo:1. sensazioni: ero un poco preoccupato per lo spessore, invece, per quanto riguarda le tasche e la sensazione tenendolo in mano, nessun problema, anzi, decisamente piacevole: non da l\'impressione di qualcosa che si potrebbe rompere se lo stringi troppo, o se lo metti nella tasca posteriore dei pantaloni e ti ci siedi sopra.Mi ricorda, come sensazione, i vecchi Nokia 3310 indistruttibili.2. schermo: piccolo, ma comunque uso occhiali da lettura 1,5 anche per il precedente telefono (non enorme, ma più grande) e anche per leggere lo schermo del PC. Non mi da alcun problema (per me che uso occhiali). Secondo me chi ha una normale vista da vicino non avrà nessun problema. Io uso lo swipe per scrivere e non ho alcun problema, il touch screen mi pare molto preciso.3. velocità: rispetto al mio precedente telefono è un fulmine (ma il precedente era un 16Gb/2Gb di cui non faccio nome). Quindi molto soddisfatto, ma forse solo perché questo è un 128Gb/6Gb.4. foto: non uso molto il telefono per fare foto, ma mi sembrano buone. 48Mpix in effetti non sono pochi.5. tasto configurabile: molto comodo per fare foto al volo o per accendere la torcia senza doverci pensare troppo.6. sensore impronta (questo per me è fondamentale). Il telefono precedente aveva il sensore sul retro ( e quindi viene naturale configurare indice e medio delle due mani). Questo è frontale e viene naturale configurare i due pollici e, per me, l\'indice destro. Funziona ottimamente.7. Wifi. Ho avuto qualche problema di instabilità con il router wireless di casa (wind 3), dopo aver configurato IP fisso (come consigliato) nessun problema.8. rapporto qualità prezzo: per me ottima, costa più di quanto sono abituato a spendere per uno strumento che, IMHO, non dovrebbe costare più di tanto, ma molto meno di oggetti magari più ""trendy"" ma tecnicamente equivalenti.9. ha anche la radio FM che per alcuni è molto comoda e che stanno eliminando dalla maggior parte degli altri telefoniPer il momento nulla altro da aggiungere.

Unfortunately it was aggressively rejected and the accounts were suspended by both of the GSM networks I use, Cricket and AT&T (technically the same architecture, since AT&T owns Cricket, but they have very different data packages and customer service so I have accounts with both). Unihertz still has work to do with this phone.Edit: It turns out that AT&T/Cricket has begun a policy of rejecting any and all phone changes while they migrate off 3G technology, so any time you move a SIM it will block your service until you call in and tell them what kind of phone you\'re using. According to the rep I spoke with, this will continue until at least February 2022.Edit Again: After two hours on the phone with AT&T tech support, I finally made an actual phone call and started using mobile data. I was happy for less than one hour when they suspended the service again for using a 3G phone. I may keep the phone because I like it and I think Unihertz will eventually be able to resolve this with a software update, but for now it goes back in the box and the review remains at two stars.Final Edit (June 2021): I kept saying I was going to put it back in the box, but it kept working. After that last suspension two months ago it hasn\'t had even the slightest hiccup in service. If you buy this phone, I suggest you don\'t put in the SIM until you turn it on, give it access to WiFi, and let it completely finish the software setup. Make sure you check for any Android updates (Settings>System>Advanced>System update). Be sure you check your network settings and verify 4G is selected/preferred and HD calling is enabled. Do not put in the SIM and let it connect to your cellular provider UNTIL all the software is installed and the configuration is up to date.As for the phone itself, I was wanting something comparable to the old Sony Xperia Compact but with updated operating system. This checks the boxes in size, software, and operating power, but the interface just doesn\'t seem as robust. I keep selecting apps I had no intention of entering. It\'s nearly the same size as the Compact yet I spend far more time correcting text than sending it, even though using the same keyboard, dictionary, and texting app on both phones. I prefer it to anything else currently in Android production but really, that\'s not saying a whole lot. I think this is something they can improve on with hardware so I look forward to seeing the next iteration from Unihertz.Overall, four stars I think. Everything was fine until walking through the grocery store one day and a little 4-year-old jumped up in her shopping cart and yelled, ""Daddy, Daddy, that man\'s phone looks just like mine!!"" So glad Unihertz and I could add some joy to someone\'s day.', '良い', ""Had this phone for almost 2 years.  Many things I love about it, a few factors are annoying.The good is it has decent battery life, I love the thick and heavy feel of it, and Unihertz offers a decent case (I filed down the rear belt clip attachment til it was flush).  However, case doesn't have deep bezel to protect screen or edges.The bad is that because of the nature and obscurity of Unihertz to the general public, tempered glass screen protectors are non-existent.  Unihertz doesn't make them, and the cheap plastic films made by Unihertz and other 3rd party brands bubble up and slide off the screen within weeks or even days.  My phone has been used in very rugged environment as I'm a landscaper. It's exposed to hard drops, relentless dust, and moisture once in a while.  Through all these challenges, the one thing that broke my screen is when I lightly tossed my phone on my bed, it just happened to hit a belt buckle just the right way on the curved edge of the screen and that's what did it.The decent news is I've continued to use it for many months since that incident, and the cracking hasn't gotten any worse, even after many more drops.  But the screen has accumulated quite a bit more scratching.UI problems include not being able to assign default volume for the side volume control, having to restart applications every once in a while due to them freezing or not working properly, and lack of screen casting options.Otherwise, I love the feel of this phone, I like the placement of the USB type C and 3.5 mm headphone jack.  It's not a bad phone, and it was also my very first smart phone.  I love the ideas that Unihertz has going for them and their phone line-up is truly innovative and unique and they're always listening to their customers needs for phone design, but again, their Achilles heel is the lack of protection for the screen.  The availability of a simple $10 tempered glass screen protector would have been a game changer in my mind, but if Unihertz never takes the first step to offer it, it will probably never be available for any of their phones due to their obscurity and unique screen designs.I feel a little sad wanting to move on from this phone, because I really want to love it more than I do, along with many of the other phones Unihertz offers, but I think I need to move on."", 'Got my Atom L today, executed Plan ""A"" and tried my Straight Talk SIM right after phone setup, even though my Straight Talk phone is on the Verizon network it would not work. Straight Talk customer service ran the imei and said it was incompatible.Plan ""B""- walked into my local Verizon store and was told as of just a month ago Verizon no longer supported a lot of non-Verizon phones, the tech ran the imei and sure enough the Atom L was not usable on the Verizon network (YMMV, this was ONE tech at ONE Verizon store, but he was the manager so he\'s probably right, do your homework first)Plan ""C"" - T-Mobile was right next to Verizon, 5 minutes after walking into T-Mobile my Atom L made a test call. T-Mobile was a little more costly than Straight talk but it\'s a no cancellation fee / cancel any time contract with unlimited everything so I gave them a try.So .. The phone feels stout and the OS is a little peculiar for me just switching from my beloved Samsung Luna with Android 6, but it seems intuitive and I feel it will grow on me quickly. The phone has a TON of strange features and a ""Toolbox"" for doing all sorts of measurements and picture leveling and stuff. My favorite feature so far is the re-implementation of the notification LED, a feature I have missed for years. It\'s just the tiniest red LED on the upper left that blinks every few seconds but I wouldn\'t even be able to guess how many times I\'ve missed out on stuff over the years because I didn\'t see a text or missed call.The phone isn\'t truly small, it\'s not large either but it\'s just awkwardly small enough not to feel right on my face whilst talking, and it\'s twice as thick as a common smart phone.Over all I\'m happy with this phone on my first day of life with it, if things change I\'ll update my review but for now I\'m really happy to have a phone that can do modern apps that isn\'t more of a tablet than a phone.Edit: Been well over a month now, life with the Atom L is good, the keyboard is a little easy to bumble the wrong key with due to it\'s size and there\'s literally 1, yes 1 option for a phone case (which I did purchase).Not the phone\'s fault but an Android thing is that I can no longer open a lot of pictures from merchant sites in another tab in FF to zoom in on them. I guess my old phone went under the radar with the different merchant sites because it was so outdated. Aside from those flaws which are really not flaws I have no regrets.If a phone case manufacturer reads this, please for the love of God make a case that has a stylus holster for the Atom phones!']"

However, this one pertains to 5g on ATT.  I was on their cheapest prepaid plan where you pay the annual amount which equates to a $25/mth average fee. This plan DID NOT allow connection to the 5g network.  The speeds were still very good but I wanted to experience 5g on this phone.  So I switched to the $65/mth prepaid plan which gives 22gb of 5g data.My 5g experience was horrible.  The speeds usually remained at 1.5mbps to 3.4mbps throughout the day.  Only late at night did speeds get up to 43mbps.  Tinkering around with the phone I tried to test LTE but could not find Network Mode which should have been under Mobile Networks in the settings.  If you can\'t find it on your A71 5g, simply go to your dialer and enter this string of characters:  *#*#4636#*#*  It will automatically take you to a menu of 3 options.  Choose ""Phone Information"".  Then click the option for ""Set Preferred Network Type"".  Then select LTE only.Lo and behold my speeds were 43mbps to 83mpbs in the middle of the day consistently.  I don\'t know how good 5g is on other carriers but where I am, the speed is slow on ATT even though the coverage map shows that it should be strong.  Going to LTE only is giving me speeds faster than broadband.  I hope this helps!8 MONTH UPDATE (June 12, 2021):Eight months in and I still have no complaints regarding my purchase of the A71 5G.  I\'m loving all the updates it has received including Android 11.  I have figured out how to successfully get the finger print reader to work 100% of the time.  Basically, I\'ve just trained my hand and thumb to place my thumb perfectly where it needs to be.  It\'s like second nature now.  Samsung continually updates its customization apps.  If you have this phone you really do need to make sure you have the latest version of Good Lock (found in the Samsung store) and its various modules.  You\'ll be able to control the adjustments to just about every facet of the phone.  I love the camera on this phone.  The shutter speed is average, however, in outdoor lighting the pictures are phenomenal.  The wide angle selection for the rear camera and the selfie camera produces excellent shots.  One thing I did wish the camera had was motion autofocus.  You\'ll just have to spend flagship money to get a feature like that.Overall my experience with this phone has been excellent.  The battery life is still excellent and still charges very quickly.  I\'m still using video background on my lock screen and home screens and the battery still performs like a champ.  I\'ve upgraded my wireless earbuds to Bose from the Galaxy Buds.  No BT connection issues at all.  My phone also connects to my Win10 laptop via the built in Link to Windows feature.  The only drawback is that I still can\'t get the laptop to show the phone\'s screen.  My laptop is older and doesn\'t have Mirror Share on it so that might be the reason.  On a good note though the SmartView feature on the phone works extremely well with my Roku.  I can mirror my phone\'s screen on my TV through the Roku using this feature.  Displaying photos and video to family on a large wide screen TV is amazing but the biggest benefit is displaying Zoom calls on the TV from my phone.  I can use the phone as the webcam but then see everything and everyone on the TV.I still highly recommend people get this phone.  The features and the quality that you get for the price can\'t be matched by other phones.2 MONTH UPDATE (Nov 11, 2020):Two months in and I\'m still quite happy with the A71 5g.  I\'ve removed plenty of the bloat using methods I found on the Internet.  Just google ""How to Remove Samsung Bloatware without Root technastic"".  The first link in the results should take you to the article.  The method is for more advanced users. You will need to use your computer to assist in the removal.DEALING WITH SPAM CALLS AND TEXTS:  During this election season I received non-stop spam calls and texts.  No matter how many times I blocked a phone number the calls and texts still came in from new numbers.SOLUTION:  I put the phone in ""Do Not Disturb"" mode in the Settings.  This kills all notifications.  I then selected to allow notifications from my contacts.  I made sure to add companies that I deal with such as banks etc. that may call into my contacts list.  The only drawback is that this doesn\'t apply to Duo or other apps that you may receive messages on.  For example, if someone DM\'s you on Instagram, you won\'t see the notification.5g ABILITY:  I am on AT&T\'s prepaid plan. To pay the least amount, I paid for a full year.  I didn\'t realize that 5g is not available on most prepaid plans.  Oh well. It doesn\'t really matter much because my use doesn\'t require downloading super large files.  There\'s no advantage to streaming movies or sending/receiving texts and emails on 5g than on 4g LTE.  Loading websites on 5g might be quicker but it\'s negligible.  The only prepaid plan that gives you 5g support on AT&T is their Premium Plus plan for $75/month.  I don\'t believe that 5g is worth the extra $50 per month.Overall the A71 5g is a champ.  The screen is crystal clear and the phone operates smoothly even though at 60hz.  I\'ve customized it and have removed much of the bloat.  The facial recognition is quick and flawless.  I have it configured to open directly to the home page-no extra buttons to push or extra swipes to make.  I just lift the phone and tip towards my face and it opens to the home screen.  Battery life hasn\'t been a problem.  My usage includes 3 to 4 hours of Youtube Music streaming high quality music while connected to Galaxy Bud Live bluetooth earbuds, an hour or so of Youtube videos in 1080p, 3 plus hours on Google News, 3 cumulative hours in Instagram, an ongoing texts throughout the day. I use a video background on the home screen as well as a video background on the lock screen.  I usually end the day with about 30%-40%.  I then just refill overnight.I\'ll update again in a few months.----------------------------------------------------------------Quick Update September 15:  My neighborhood is right in the center of a 5g area according to the ATT coverage map. However, I have yet to see ""5G"" appear on my phone.  I\'ve only ever seen LTE. I\'m not sure what the problem is.Original Review September 10:My A71 5G arrived yesterday.  I\'ve spent the last 24 hours customizing it.Here are my First Thoughts:- Screen is amazing. Videos are much better when viewed on Samsung displays.- The phone itself is quite a thin slab.  It\'s thinner than my glass bodied Honor 8 from 2017 which was my daily phone until now.  This makes the A71 5G extremely slippery.- The phone has many customization features although not quite as customizable or as easy to customize as my Honor 8.- Back plastic looks good but is still very slippery.- Camera system is more advanced than my Honor 8.  Focus, clarity, wide angle, etc, the A71 5g looks to have an awesome camera. I will test out and update this review later.- Fingerprint & facial recognition are consistently accurate if I\'m paying attention to what I\'m doing. You can\'t get lazy or you will get errors before it lets you in.- Always On Display is cool but there\'s no configuration for adding your own photo or video or animated gif- Call quality is excellent- Transferring data from old phone to new phone is kind of a chore. You\'ll still have to do plenty manually after the automated transfer process- the One UI is buttery smooth just like everyone says.- dismissing apps from the recently used screen is a swipe up rather than swipe rightSurprises I Encountered:- A71 5G doesn\'t use a Samsung dialer as its native dialer app.  It uses an app from Hiya.  If you want the app to filter spam then you\'ll have to give up some privacy to Hiya.- Microsoft apps come already installed.  The downside is that you won\'t be able to get Outlook to access your mail. According to the reviews the app is currently screwed up after a recent update.  I couldn\'t get it to connect to any of my email accounts (non gmail and non hotmail accounts).- There is no native email app installed on the phone. I had to download Samsung Mail from the Play Store.- There\'s no way to configure ring tones and alert tones for contacts in Google Contacts.  I use Hangouts for my permanent personal number from Google Voice.  On my Honor 8, I could configure a unique tone for each of my contacts. I could also configure special ring tones.  No such luck with the A71 5G.- The charging cord is USB-C to USB-C which means the charging brick has a USB-C socket.  This is great when you want to connect the A71 5g to an old phone to transfer files, but it negates my ability to use my newly purchased 6ft USB-C charging cord w/magnetic attachments.  The way the cord works is that there is an adapter that fits into the phone\'s USB-C socket with a round magnetic connector that the cord easily connects to. The cord itself has a magnetic connector on one end and a regular USB male on the other to connect to a charging brick.  The A71 5G\'s charging brick only accepts USB-C.- The phone has a built-in ""app lock"" type of function.  It allows you to put apps and files into a secure folder. The apps or files in the folder can\'t be opened unless you use your fingerprint or PIN.  The surprise here is that when you place an app in the folder, it creates a new instance of that app which means you will still have the app accessible as normal but you will have a new instance of the app which requires secure access.  So if you have a dirty Instagram account and a clean account, you can have the clean account logged into the app in the app drawer and the secured version of the app logged into the dirty account.  I had to do some Google searches to figure out why I was still able to open an app placed in the secured folder from the regular app drawer.So-so Observations:- 5G speed:  I tested at 9:30pm.  I live in a suburban area adjacent to a metropolitan city. AT&T supposedly has 5G in my area.  I got an average of 45mbps download speed and 7.7mbps upload speed via speedtest.net.  I compared that to my broadband speed of 64.7mbps download & 10.25mbps upload with Centurylink using the 5ghz channel on the router.  I probably would have gotten better speeds with TMobile but oh well. Let me know what you\'re getting if you have AT&T with any 5G phone.- Theme customizations.  If you come from a Honor phone like me you\'ll miss your ability to fully customize your UI such as choosing among a large selection of available navigation buttons; a huge selection of different icon sets and not just icons that are contained inside a square or a circle but true free floating graphics; a user friendly interface to customize lock screen features including wallpaper from within the same theme customization interface. I took for granted that these things were the norm across all devices but not so this Samsung device.  You have to go back-and-forth through multiple menu items to make changes to different parts of the UI.  For example, if I want to place my own personal video as wallpaper on my lock screen, I have to do it via a handful of menus rather than the Themes app which itself, btw, can only be accessed via the Settings menu.More observations to follow.', 'I\'m not entirely sure if I got a returned/refurbished phone or not - the packaging was immaculate (not at all like it had been repackaged). When I first turned it on I was greeted with an Android command-line boot screen, which I\'m somewhat familiar with - I moved the cursor down to ""wipe phone"" and the next screen was the image I posted. There shouldn\'t have been a reason for me to get that screen at first power on.Having said that, the factory reset procedure went flawlessly, the Samsung transfer app worked beautifully to get all my information and apps moved to this new phone, and after a couple of logins the A51 was up and running.  The main reason I bought it was because of its storage - I am so tired of running out of space with 32 GB phones. I keep NOTHING on the phones - I cleaned caches, I kept no documents, no photos, no music, I constantly moved apps to the SD cards - yet, after about a year or so of updates, all the storage space disappears. I have no idea where, as I run my phones excessively lean. So I opted for this 128GB model.It\'s a BEAUTIFUL phone to look at, stylish, black iridescent back, and a simply gorgeous screen. Very thin and slippery, however, and I\'d read many reviews of breakage so I also ordered protective casing and screen protectors. I have never used fingerprint login on any of my other phones before and I\'ve read that the tempered glass screen protectors make that feature difficult to use - I can\'t speak to that. Never used it before, don\'t miss it now.I\'m 62. I\'m not a gamer, so I don\'t need the highest/fastest processor. I need clear, bright, sharp visuals, a decent speaker, and enough speed so that I can play podcasts without stuttering. Reliable WiFi and Internet access are a must. This phone fits all of those criteria. I use it with Android Auto in my Toyota to listen to those aforementioned podcasts on my way to work, I access my email and make Amazon purchases via the device, what phone calls I make are clear and understandable, and it\'s plenty fast enough for the purposes I use these little pocket computers for. I added a 128 GB SD card (that card may have a fault or two because I still habitually move apps to the card - a holdover from my days with low-storage phones, and sometimes those moved apps need to be reinstalled after they\'ve updated).  But the phone itself, in spite of my wariness when I first powered it up, has been flawless. There are comments about this phone not being able to connect to mobile data through services like Tracfone, and the statements about the simple fix (checking which access point it\'s connecting to and adding the right one if it\'s not listed) are spot-on. I had that problem with a prior phone and so I knew to look for it when setting this up - sure enough, it didn\'t have the right access ID listed. I typed it in and it\'s connected fine from that point on. It\'s already updated itself to Android 11 and I am given to understand that it will soon update to Android 12.  For the money, as a Tracfone user, this was a bargain and a half. I simply love this phone!Update as of May 25: The phone DID get Android 12,and the only thing was that I had to reenter the correct access point name for Tracfone (VZWINTERNET) in order to get data access. Everything else appears to have gone smoothly.', 'UPDATE Two months after using this phone.--Loudness is a big plus. I can hold this phone 5 inches away, it is loud enough to hear and speak with others. Due to radiation dangers, I like being able to use this phone without holding it to my ear.--4GB memory makes this phone work better than its contemporaries with 3 or 2 GB memory and slightly (lets say 50%) stronger CPU-Processor.--Receptivity with my home wifi and with cell phone towers is excellent.*** I use my Google voice phone number on this too! It works great on this A51. I like having two phone numbers on one phone. I have an Obi at home to use with my Google Voice. Now I have disconnected it, to use this phone as my Google voice connection.--- I like the huge, very high def. OLED screen--- Phone is very touch responsive. Much better than my old LG Rebel 4....I also use a stylus with A51. Cheap generic styluses work well on A51. You do not need to buy an official Samsung stylus.I have been building and using Windows PCs since 1997. This phone is one of the top 5 ""computer"" upgrades I have ever done. My old LG was pathetic compared to this A51 and its receptivity was fading, for whatever reason. With dropped phones calls and so on.___________________________________It rings loudly, but also those who phone me....their voices come in loud! Which I like! So I can hold it 5"" from my mouth. This way I don\'t get all those LTE frequencies entering my skull and brain. Safer this way. Good way to stimulate getting brain cancer is to hold a cell phone at your ear for hours each day.I bought this on Black Friday at Amazon ---  for  $100It came with Android 10 and started to automatically upgrade to Android 11. Android 12 is alive, and being rolled out, but being doled out to Gooogle Pixel phones first. I cannot wait to get android 12My previous phone had Android 8 and was not going to upgrade above 8Android 11 is so much better and more logical than Android 8. It is 10 times better.With my previous phone, my reception and connectivity for voice phone calls via TracFone was getting worse and worse. Especially in my house. With phone calls breaking up etc. /  With my new A51 these problems are gone.This A51 phone has the wifi-calling feature (old phone did not) which I can activate if I need to enhance my phone call reception when at home. This means that if necessary, part of my phone call is routed through the internet via my home wifi network. It hitches a ride with my wifi.### Just as a test, I have not yet activated wifi calling. No need to. Your case might be different. If you are in a rural area and have a home wifi network. For sure look into wifi calling. Go to settings >>> Connections>>>wifi calling with its on-off slider buttonThe OLED screen is very vivid and lovely. It has a blue light filter/damper for use at night.  Battery life is good and probably very good.I have not really used the very high rez cameras much yet. Only briefly and they seem OKBottom line is that me talking reception is much better/ in fact I have zero problems. Thanks Samsung!! ... I never buy  Apple', ""Update: still using this with wifi for apps only.  I want to find a that is easier in one hand, smaller size/ width.  I find if using one hand, its too wide, uncomfortable.  And if I am laying down, it'll easy flap down into my face because I don't manage it well with one hand.Previous:I ordered this phone as a upgrade for my A20-something that has less storage.  Old phone is still kicking so using this phone with wifi connection only, not with phone service yet, *So my reviews are based on all other features.  Will update.Facial recognition: When attempting to record a video on this feature, with the opinion that it isn't all that great, my video proved me wrong.  My new conclusion is that it is adaptive.  Once the phone recognizes your face from certain positions, it works fine, usually on the second initial attempt from that position/angle.  Not bad.Lockscreen lock/ blackout time:  At first, I didn't like how quickly the lock screen cuts off when the facial recognition doesn't work after the initial attempt. The dilemma I imagined is: I'm driving  and want a quick facial recognition, it does not work, then I become a distracted driver (maybe more so at this point) attempting to quickly press that little bitty retry icon BUT then the screen quickly cuts off.  No settings to change this.  But I recognized that it's as simple as hitting the side button again to retry.  I've got to get with the 'make life simpler' game.Fingerprint: video recording test of the finger recognition passed with flying colors.  **Here's where a problem lies- not the phone (at least not with mine) but with Screen Protectors.  Many have hardly-visible dots in their design and these distort your finger print.  I love the particular case I purchased but it comes with one of those protectors.  I plan to order a different protector and cut this one out.  From many screen protector reviews, though, it looks like this is a pretty common problem.Phone case: When finding a case, reading several reviews, I discovered that you have to be careful to not just find a A51 case, but specifically A51 4g.  There are apparently other versions or something.  So just keep your eye out.Personal opinion:This is an upgrade for me.  Hence, I was not expecting for the phone to be top-notch like for $250 to infinity$$+ phone.Looks: The screen looks good and sharp.  Nice and sleek.  I don't prefer large size screen, but they only give you so many options one year verses the next.Picture quality: Picture quality is very likely just OK.  (I don't spoil myself by seeing what higher priced phones qualities are like).  But in comparison to my old phone, the pictures are brighter.Phone service/ quality:  not tested yet.  Will update later"", 'Had I only known 2 weeks ago when I bought my A71 5G, I would have  waited and pre-ordered the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE. Though you get a 6.5"" on the S20 FE screen vs 6.7"" on the A71, the S20 FE  gives you so much more for just $100 difference in price. Both are 5G enabled, have a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 and Gorilla Glass 3 screen protection, but only the Galaxy S20 FE supports a 120Hz refresh rate vs. the A71\'s 60Hz refresh rate. Similarly, each phone is powered by a 4,500mAh battery with 25W fast charging capabilities but only the Galaxy S20 FE supports wireless charging and wireless PowerShare. S20 FE has stereo speakers vs. A71\'s single-firing speaker.  Both phones have an aluminum frame and a plastic back panel but the Galaxy S20 FE has more colorful choices and has a matte finish which shows less fingerprints. In addition, the Galaxy A71 has UFS 2.1 storage while the Galaxy S20 FE takes advantage of the much faster UFS 3.0 standard. The Galaxy S20 FE features the newer Snapdragon 865 chipset in the US as opposed to the Exynos 980 solution in the A71. It also ships with the latest version of One UI (2.5) instead of One UI 2.1. In fact, the Galaxy S20 FE delivers a complete One UI flagship-grade experience with features like Samsung DeX / wireless DeX. Last but not least, the new budget flagship is IP68-certified whereas the Galaxy A71 5G lacks dust and water protection.  The front-facing lens on the S20 FE is only 3.34mm in diameter (the smallest in any Samsung device), giving you more ""entirely flat"" screen, less lens notch. Camera setup is also slightly different, but that\'s a matter of taste.Buyer\'s remorse in light of the forthcoming Samsung Galaxy S20 FE? Yes.  However, my experience with the A71 has been fine overall. I wanted a larger screen than my  Pixel 2\'s  5.7"" screen and this one delivers. It\'s bright, colorful. The phone also has a lot of bells & whistles thanks to Samsung\'s UI (I strongly suggest watching Tips & Tricks videos on YouTube to take full advantage of what a Samsung phone offers). However, some of those bells and whistles do not work such as Dolby Atmos sound (it makes no difference if  it\'s on or off), the Display Edge Lighting (which only works for me when the phone is locked and the screen is black. It doesn\'t work with any other apps like it should). The camera is great and shows you how to get the best shot (and it works). I don\'t listen to music without earbud, so I can\'t comment on listening to music on the one speaker. But the speaker is fine for videos with dialogue.  The on-screen thumbprint unlock is a nightmare (something you have to have to deal with it on all new  Samsung phones). Rarely does it unlock the first time and because of the size of the phone I have to use one hand to keep the phone steady while the other hand\'s fingerprint is used to unlock the phone.  Battery life is nothing short of amazing. I\'ve gone two days with 30% battery left (no heavy video usage, but heavy on apps, email and texts). And if you haven\'t experienced 5G--Wow! I can get reception in places like elevators and my doctor\'s office that I couldn\'t before.  I don\'t play games, so I can\'t comment on its processor.  Satisfied overall with the Galaxy A71 5G? Yes. Disappointed I didn\'t know to hold out for the Galaxy S20 FE which only costs $100 more? DEFINITELY.', ""This is an amazing phone and I'm still using it after years with no thought of trade-ins or selling it. Awesome buy!!! 👌"", 'I wanted to buy an unlocked, reasonably priced, sort of future proof phone because I\'m not totally satisfied with my current carrier (Boost Mobile) and I am tired of ""collecting"" carrier-locked phones in a drawer when I switch to a new provider and have to purchase a new device.  I was almost set on purchasing a Galaxy A51 when the A71 5G showed up on Amazon.  It looked like a huge step up from my old phone (Galaxy A20) as well as the A51.  I wasn\'t necessarily looking for 5G because it\'s still in its infancy, but things like the Snapdragon 765G processor, 128GB of storage and 6GB RAM were appealing, not to mention the 6.7-inch full HD+ Super AMOLED display.  After briefly being distracted by the Galaxy S10 Lite (same price, faster processor, but no headphone jack), I popped for the A71 5G.  So far, I\'m not sure I made the right choice; here\'s why:1.) My old A20 had a 4000 mAh battery that frankly was disappointing. It came up short when compared to my previous phone, an LG XCharge that was nothing special except for the 4500 mAh battery that had unreal longevity (in fact, I recently turned it on after it has sat in a drawer for almost four months and it had 65% charge left).  Most days, I had to charge the A20 every night.  I bring this up because just yesterday I had to recharge my new A71 5G TWICE in one day.2.)  There are a few barriers in the smallish house where I live that challenge the wifi router.  The A20 would disconnect sometimes; the A71 5G disconnects much more frequently.  Some apps seem more susceptible to disconnection than others, which made me wonder if the issue was the apps rather than the connection.  With the A20, I\'m pretty sure the apps were the problem; I\'m not so sure with the A71 5G.  I have seen other reviews here and elsewhere that reference disconnection issues with this phone.  Hmm...3.)  The step up to full HD from the A20\'s 720p was a bigger improvement than I expected, so this is a plus for the new phone.  However, the audio is just a lateral move; neither is that great.  While this isn\'t a deal breaker per se, the new LG Velvet as well as the new Galaxy S20 Fe both have stereo speakers; while the S20 FE is $100 more (as I write this), the LG is the same price and has twice the storage (256GB vs 128GB).  Honestly if there were an unlocked version of the LG Velvet available today, I\'d take a serious look at it.Overall, the pluses of my A71 5G don\'t quite outweigh the minuses.  With the S10 Lite still being available at the same price (albeit sans headphone jack) and the new S20 FE being just $100 more, if the connection issues can\'t be resolved with this A71 5G, I may be making a change.', ""I did my homework before buying the Galaxy A51, so I knew I would be getting a budget midrange phone that doesn't offer what the S series phones have.  The chipset in this phone isn't great, and the 4gb of RAM means it can't multitask very well.  With that in mind, my thoughts:Pros:-The display is pretty incredible given the price of this phone.-Battery life is pretty good; lasts a full day on a charge with moderate use.-Great storage capacity (128gb) plus micro sd storage means you can stuff the phone with apps and media.-Very decent camera, especially in well-lit situations, although it struggles a bit in low-light.  4k video recording for this price range is pretty insane and video quality is great.-A ton of phone for the money.-Signal is decent; it's nowhere near the worst I've seen on a phone, but it's not the best either.  The antennae in this phone do their job as long as there's cell and/or wi-fi in your immediate vicinityCons:-The Exynos 9611 chipset is weak compared to Snapdragon chipsets.  This phone runs the latest games like Genshin Impact and Call of Duty Mobile on the lowest possible settings fairly decently, but I wouldn't buy this phone specifically to game on if you have the money to spend on a phone with a better chipset.-The bloatware on this phone is outrageous.  Be prepared to spend an hour or two uninstalling invasive junk apps and disabling everything you can't uninstall.Overall, the A51 is great value for the money; I just wish the chipset was better.  If you're not a hardcore gamer it won't really be an issue, and even if you want to play games on it it's good enough to run anything available, but it's not a futureproof phone as far as the chipset goes.As for Tracfone's services, they're adequate.  Nothing more to really say.  You get about what you pay for."", 'Camera could be better. Not the latest or greatest. But acceptable for my use']"

I'm also neither a gamer (at least not on mobile) nor do I use it as my primary work tool (that's what the desktop is for).I am however a rather clumsy person who uses public transport, and this phone is NOT up to that kind of use. The construction of this phone is too thin, round and smooth to be practical for pocket carry (without a case, and screen protector). I do enjoy listening to music, and I have to say while I don't ever expect anything fantastic from a phone's speakers (I use headphones for that), they are not only surprisingly weak but have a pretty heavy skew for the bass tones which is bad because I need a strong mid range for alarms and notifications.Talking about the speakers and the flimsy construction. It is worth noting that this phone is soo thin and the bass skew is soo strong that the whole phone feels like its vibrating along with the music, even when its at medium volume.  For the speakers to rattle the phone this much, I feel safe in saying that this phone won't survive 2 years of city use.As for software, hardware. Stock Android is the best android so no complaints here, and the hardware is almost too powerful for what I use it for, and I have no doubt this power for the phone SERIOUSLY contributes to its middling battery-life. While new the battery lasts about 12 hours of constant use, but as the phone ages I fear this will rapidly turn into 2 hours, and that contributes to the feel of disposable phone.This is a phone that REQUIRES a strong case and screen protector to be even remotely durable.Overall its a decent phone but not one I can recommend"", 'Light weight, apt size and ease of access are pros.', 'Finally died today.

Previous smartphones I've owned have lasted beyond the final security updates available for each one, and that's my bare-minimum expectation for a phone costing several hundred dollars.

The night mode is also good. the ultra wide is not exactly ultra wide as you see on other phones but it does take some good ultra wide photos and you also get the unlimited backup on this pixel. This feature is not available for pixel 5 and above devices. So this pixel 4a 5g is the last device to have this.The battery is okish, it can get you through the day. I use this as a secondary device so I can get easily 2 days with it.The display is very good but if you come from using a QuadHD+ display then you might notice some subtle difference. the touch responsiveness is also very good. Always on display is nice to have.It comes with 5g so its future proof. I got this shipped with android 11 but got the update for android 13 right after I turned it on.( android 13 launched just a few days ago). In terms of latest updates you will get all latest updates ahead of any other manufacturer.The ram management is okish but it can suffice daily usage requirements. This phone is not for high performance. I am yet to install pubg on this and test it on that angle.the phone comes with a 18W type charger and cable included but the pin is not the indian pin, it is the standard western pin. but its good to see a charging brick in the box these days. the charging speed is not damn good, its okish. It takes 1.5hrs something to charge to 100%I would recommend you to not update the software on this phone and go with the software it comes out of the box. The more you update, the sh*ttier the phone gets later on (speaking from personal experience from android phones).After 3 months :So I’ve updated the phone and it is working really good(that is something I’ve never expected from an android). The charging time is too much if you use it moderately.Multi tasking is a nightmare and this phone can’t handle heavy gaming as well. I tried pubg in lowest settings and high frame rate. It lags but it can manage. I am looking to buy a more watt power brick for this may be a 65W brick as I’m not used to wait for so long to charge the phone. I used one plus and iPhones before so they charge so much faster and this charges so slow even with 18W charger.', ""Just got this phone a few days ago, so still evaluating it but wanted to clarify one point that some users are having a different experience with-the 5G functionality with VZW.  I've attached a photo showing that the 4A 5G that I received from Amazon DOES work with VZW's 5G band.  Just wanted to get that point out here on the reviews, based on what I had read here I was ready to handle just a 4G connection, so I'm excited to see that 5G icon!  So far, love this unit.  I've always been a pixel fan, except for the pixel 4 and it's huge forehead and chin, seemed to go opposite of the smartphone trends.  Say what you want about a plastic build, but I love it.  It's so light.  And what's is the big draw to a glass back build?  Glass breaks people, plastic doesn't.  And have fun paying for that glass replacement, since none of the phone insurance plans will cover it.  And what do 99 % of us do with our glass sandwiches???  Slap a rubber or plastic case on it.  I'd rather have the plastic build, yes with a case, but the weight is so much less since it isn't wrapped in glass.  Big proponent of the pure google experience on the pixel series and no overlaid UI from the manufacturer.  Battery life on this one is good.  Started out at 830 this morning and at 1900 was at 45%.  Plenty of screen time during the day.  So no complaints there.  Speakers are incredible.  Any time you have to turn the volume down on a phone cause the sound effects are blowing you away on that game or movie, is a sign of a great set of speakers.  Charge time is fine.  Not as fast as some of the flagships, but I've been able to go from 25% to 68% in 20 minutes.  That's good enough for me, and I'm rarely away from a plug or a battery pack, so charge time isn't a huge factor for me.  The fingerprint reader is what we've come to expect on the pixel -  Faster than lightning.  The in screen readers on the flagships are just no where near as reliable or fast.  I'll have to get used to the rear mount again, but that's not a problem for me.  If you need face recognition or wireless charging then this isn't the device for you obviously.  But I don't list that as a kick in the nuts to the pixel 4A 5G, it just doesn't have it, so if you need those options then look elsewhere.  For my money, 459 for this phone is an awesome deal.  This will be my daily driver for the near future, for sure."", 'I Luv the Palm size Grip', ""I needed a replacement for my Samsung Galaxy s4 I bought in 2014.  The Samsung phone still worked but with Android 5 most apps would not run on it.  Also I was getting so many spam calls here in Las Vegas that it was driving me crazy.First priority I wanted a phone that would screen calls for me.  None of the call blocker apps worked well enough for me and I did not want to pay extra charges for some premium app.  When I heard that Google had a built in call screener, I decided I had to get a Pixel phone.Next I wanted a phone that would stay current with software updates as long as possible because I intend to keep it forever.  Google guarantees three years worth of updates which is the longest I could find.  So I had to get  Pixel phone.Finally I wanted a phone with a big enough screen that i could read it easily as I am over 70 and my eyes aren't what they used to be.

If I had waited a bit longer i could have gotten $50 off, but that's life.I've had the phone now for around three months and it works well.  I LOVE the call screener,  It comes with Android 11 and should be good at least through Android 14.  The size is just right and it is much faster than my old S4 and runs all the apps I will ever use.I don't make many calls so one charge lasts almost 4 days.  It charges completely from almost zero to 100% in about an hour and a half - much faster than my S4.The only weak point is that occasionally the fingerprint reader takes several tries to work.I signed up with T-Mobile on their $15/mo plan and the connections I get around Vegas are superb.  Often I get a 5G connection and I have yet to have a dropped call.  I rarely use data outside my home so 2GB/mo is plenty for my use.  I rarely use the camera. I have heard it is great.

I still have an iPhone 8 Plus that is awesome.  Also part of the equation is security updates.  Frequent, regular, like clockwork, security updates.With iPhone this is standard.  With android phone makers, it\'s hit and miss, mostly miss.  Samsung does update their flagship frequently... for a time.  But Samsung wants $1200 for their flagship.  No thanks.Pixel?  I heard Google provides regular, systematic updates.  Their phones don\'t cost $1000.  Saw some good things said about the Pixel, thought I\'d try the Pixel 4a 5G and see if I liked it.  I do.I don\'t have complex needs.  Other than good security, and frequent security updates, I also like good pictures and video.  The phone is light, the battery lasts a long time, the screen is just a little bit smaller than my iPhone 8 Plus and far lighter.The iPhone 8 Plus was a flagship at one time, and you can tell.  The build quality is phenomenol.  It\'s also heavy, feels expensive, and the feature set and ecosphere quite complete.  Almost heavy-ish.  I love the phone, and it\'s my backup now.  The Pixel 4a 5G is minimalist, light, leaves you ""uninvolved"" or slightly detached from the massive Google ecosphere, unless you go in and configure the various bits and pieces of it.I\'m very pleased with my purchase.  Refreshing alternative to Samsung.  Don\'t get me wrong, Samsung flagship is a beast.  But I never buy new $1000 plus phones.  So the best that I could do is buy a used or NOS Samsung Note, which I did (a Note 9), and it was a terrible experience.  Old android version, build quality was not too hot.  If you ever look at buying a flagship phone that is 2 or 3 versons behind, Samsung can\'t cut it.  Apple is much better in that scenario.  But I\'m glad that there\'s something that ""fills the gap"" between flagship phones, and just a nice, new, current, phone with frequent updates.  Who better to get an android device from, then the people who make android?', 'El teléfono en sí es un salto adelante en la experiencia global, pero eso no lo hace exento de uno que otro problema. Vivo feliz, es rápido, todo carga según lo esperado, y soy incapaz de volver a celulares de menos categoría ya que la fluidez de la interfaz y la carga de todo se echan en falta.Ahora, cosas que he notado: - No he sido persona de protectores de ninguna clase, y en este se nota mucho la versión antigua de Gorilla Glass. Jamás había tenido tantos microrrayones en tan poco tiempo como los que he tenido con el Pixel 4a 5g. Comprarlo junto a un buen protector de pantalla debería ser obligatorio. - Siempre se lee que el teléfono no sufre de ningún lag, y eso es verdad el 90% del tiempo. Tan pronto empieza a calentarse un poco, sea por lo que sea, se empieza a notar bastante, especialmente en la cámara. Más de una vez he visto la pantalla congelada mientras trato de tomar una foto. No tengo celulares de igual o más categoría con los que comparar así que no daré más vueltas en este asunto. - A mi gusto, la pantalla tiene una leve tendencia hacia el amarillo, con colores más cálidos que otras.Por otra parte, un montón de cosas buenas: - Doble toque, levantar para despertar y demás acciones que usan los sensores funcionan excelente. - El lector de huellas dactilares funciona de maravilla. En mi anterior teléfono tenía que secarme el dedo cada vez porque con muy (MUY) poco sudor ya fallaba. - La cámara trasera, para fotos, es de lo mejorcito, ni que decir de la visión nocturna. En video si se nota que no hay procesado de Google, aún así los diversos modos dan mucho juego. - La pantalla se ve muy bien, y es muy espaciosa. - La batería tiene una duración aceptable. - El brillo máximo no es tan alto, pero aún así se puede manejar en exteriores. - Siempre al día, las actualizaciones directo de la fuente y sin intermediarios.Lastima que Google cape algunas funciones, bastante interesantes, si se está fuera de EE.UU.', ""I've been impressed with the Pixel series of phones which is why I bought this one, no regrets. The price/performance ratio makes them a great choice. I love the fact that you get stock Android without all the bloatware other manufacturers install on their phones, and you get Android updates quickly.The battery can last over 48 hours depending on use, but even with heavy use it lasts the whole day, the camera takes great pictures, and 5G is fast. My old Pixel 3 XL (4G LTE) gave me about 80 mbits/sec download, this phone gives me over 500 mbits/sec download.Size wise it's right in that sweet spot, it's a touch smaller than my Pixel 3 XL but not by much. I debated getting a Pixel 5 but it's a little too small, and for some reason there is no Pixel 5 XL, in a way you can think of the Pixel 4a(5G) as the Pixel5 XL. I find the fingerprint scanner on the back is perfectly positioned for my hand size, and the case (Spigen Tough Armor) I bought guides my finger directly to it so I can quickly unlock my phone.There are a few areas they could have improved on, I wish it had Gorilla Glass 6 and a 90HZ refresh rate like the Pixel 5 but in reality it doesn't really matter that much, the touch screen works fine and animations are smooth. It also lacks water resistance, but if you don't use it in the rain/snow and take care of it you'll be fine. The 128GB storage size is adequate for me but there are probably people who could use more.It's the best phone I've had and I definitely recommend it."", 'Just broke completely with no reason after 2 years, after my first Pixel broke the same way, after 2 years.Before purchasing it, I believe Google Support told me this model would have a better life, so I naively purchased this newer model.2 years later, here we go again, broken again, I have to spend all this time I don\'t have to discuss the matter, find a new phone, reinstall everything, and grieve my lost data. No mention to the financial waste for me, and ecological waste for the planet.I reached out to the support team who seemed comprehensive at first. After they failed at helping fixing the problem, they advised me to try to get it repaired somewhere since my warranty expired (I guess phone warranties are so short nowadays as brands are totally aware they sell you crap), or to get a new phone. They gave me a 20% coupon, but I reached out again as I was still concerned about getting one of their phone after the 2 phones I got failed me so bad.The person advised me to get a Pixel 7 ""which will have an improved battery and life"". With the current sale + my coupon, the price would be ~360$. ""Not bad"" he said.Except that when I added the product to the cart and applied the coupon, the sale was removed so the final price was MORE expensive than when I didn\'t apply a coupon at all.I reached out AGAIN to the support team who after a while told me to contact another team. I contacted this other team today, I have enjoy to waste time with people who are not helpful at all, and a robot like person kept saying ""Sorry - discounts are not stackable"" showing no sign of concerns as the previous team lied to push a customer to purchase a product, and finally shut the conversation after a while.I didn\'t even ASKED for a coupon the first time, so why a company would send an unusable coupon at the first place, valid to purchase phones only except that if you use it you\'ll pay a more expensive price than anywhere else?! it\'s insulting and just shows the lack of consideration of a company for their customers.', ""I really was skeptical when I saw the price for this unit in Amazon vs ebay, but after I sorted out the difference between the two, I went ahead with this unit from Amazon, which had assured delivery and the said product was new. I used the phone to setup yesterday and there is a couple of things to note here,1. if your phone comes with some battery left then empty it completely first to eliminate all future issues with battery.2. out of the box this phone comes with android 11, update it to the latest version ad the plus point always with pixel devices have longer update channels and this phone has upgrades till october 2023 (probably till android 13).3. The charger is designed for US sockets so make sure you buy a US to UK adapter before using it in India.4. The phone's tempered glass and back covers are not easily available in the market since it isn't that popular, so you might end up spending approximately from 600 INR or more for that extra protection.5. My unit didn't come with any screen problems (like backlight bleeding or weird effects on screen), so make sure you examine enough with some tests.6. Other things are exceptional, the phone is factory unlocked as I intended it to be and works fine on local SIM cards.Another thing I don't like about amazon is the price, this has been fluctuating a lot since I purchased the product and needs attention from the upstream."", ""I needed a new phone. My iPhone had no more storage,  the home button wasn't working, and typing was sometimes messed up. I was nervous about the size of this new phone, but although it's 1.5 lbs more and a bit wider and longer, it's still manageable. I was able to easily add all the apps I needed and adjust all the settings. The finger recognition is excellent so far. I'm excited about the new SOS feature (but I'm guessing all new phones have it now). Battery life doesn't seem great, and I wish the charging cord included was longer, but I'll deal with it. The only real frustration is that all my whatsapp data got lost when transferring to this phone: conversations, pictures and videos. 😕😩.In general, though, the phone is easy to use and I'm happy with my choice, so far.""]"

Granted, that was a very, very large jump in specs, but it was absolutely worth it in every regard. I absolutely love this phone and I intend to use it until it becomes unbearably so - and even by then, I'll probably have put a custom rom on it.-The 90hz screen is amazing once you see it, and other phones feel slow in comparison once you go back. It makes scrolling feel super buttery smooth.-'Warp charge' is great too - its just another word for quick charge, but this charger + cable can charge a very impressively fast 50% in about 30 minutes. You can very easily get as much charge as you need by just leaving it plugged in while you take a shower or something for a small hit. I used to have to charge my old phone at work to have a battery when I get back home, but now I can wait until the literal last hour of my shift to charge it. The cable and the hefty wall adapter feel like they're quality built.-As a result - I wanna say battery life is good, but I have only had this phone about a month. So far, its still pretty good. I see complaints here that it may wear down with time, so time will tell on that one, but initially its pretty good, and I play Pokemon Go on the daily, so I would be considered a moderately heavy user.- Gaming; I don't play much games with the exception of Pokemon Go, which I had issues with on previous phones. No issues on this phone. Its very smooth to play. That being said, there is a odd bug which causes the game to go into 30fps the first time you open it for a session. If you very quickly swipe up to go to home menu then back in, its buttery smooth. That leads me into my next point- you should be able to fix this with Tasker. Its a minor complaint of mine, and likely an issue with OxygenOS.- Oxygen OS is super snappy. Its a great addition onto the stock android expirience and doesn't add more bloat then you'd want. Included apps are mostly the standard Google apps, Netflix, and some OnePlus specific ones that can tweak pretty heavily. Its a lot cleaner then most carrier phones you'd end up getting from Verizon, etc. You can even customize the color profile of the display! I would not feel a need to use any custom roms for this one.-Camera is pretty good, but the stock Camera app saturates colors. Look into getting a port of 'Gcam' for OnePlus 7t phones. The builds are different per phone, but if you get the right software, you can get this to perfection.All things considered - if you are considering getting this phone in 2021 next year then you may want to consider getting a newer model like the 8, 8 pro or 8t which are all unfortunately more expensive but are basically the same thing at this point. Depends on the price. Theres  2 years from launch date for the os and 3 years security patches, then yes OnePlus offers that. At that point though, I'm sure you could just as easily flash the rom down the road, as there are options for later phones.Anyways, get a OnePlus phone. Its great.Signed,Ex-iOS User"", 'I\'ve had this phone since the beginning of November and it\'s been great so far. I had a oneplus 3 prior, and to be honest it was absolutely fine with that (it still works fine after five years) but my spouse\'s phone was on its way out and since he isn\'t a huge phone person, suggested I upgrade and he take my ""old"" phone.This phone has been overall amazing; the picture is remarkable, the camera is really nice and as always with OnePlus I\'ve gotten a top tier phone for a really fair price. There are some designs that I don\'t care for on the phone, but they aren\'t deal breakers for me:1. There\'s no mic spot, so I can\'t plug in my gaming headset to my phone or use an aux cable in a car- BUT these were fixed with a Bluetooth car receiver and a USB converter for under $202. Some apps don\'t play well (or at all) on the screen because it is more rectangular. The only app I\'ve had this issue with so far is the fallout vault dweller, but I can play it on my tabletSo anyway, it\'s a great phone for a great price. So far so good, and I\'m hoping this phone lasts as long as my Oneplus 3!', 'Un gran celular, ví muchos videos antes de comprar y tengo que decir que el 7T es una bestia de teléfono, en el trabajo corro planos de Autocad grandes y algunos renders 3D el telefono los corre sin gran problema, en juegos lo calé con Black desert online y recientemente con Genshin Impact. Con este último lo puse a cargar mientras jugaba y tengo que admitir que no es la mejor de las ideas, entre el warpcharge 30T y el demandante juego si alcanzó una temperatura alta y decidí cerrar el juego.Todo lo demás de Android ha sido fantástico si acaso mi única gripa con el teléfono es con un detalle de software que no te deja hacer Auto Dark Mode, sí tiene auto Night Mode que es el que elimina la luz Azul, pero el Dark mode tienes que entrar a las opciones a activarlo como tema cada vez que quieres ponerlo, otros celulares de esta gama si tienen este feature.La cámara es muy buena, no la mejor del mercado, pero funciona bastante bien, soy fanático de la fotografía y tomar mis fotos en modo Manual, se le saca mucho jugo a estás camaritas, incluso la Macro motorizada interna tiene buena calidad.Estoy en México, el celular lo conecté a AT&T y funciona perfectamente.', ""I got this phone as an upgrade from a Oneplus 5T, and with Switch, I was up running in 20 minutes. I have AT&T, so it was just a matter of moving the nano-SIM card. The phone does come with a single tray. I did however, needed to update the APN. Make sure to contact your phone provider to have the phone IMEI added to their network, to get LTE speeds -- I'm in the US. The phone should also work on Verizon's, simply need to change the preferred network to CDMA. I've attached an image showing I selected 5G -- no, the phone does not have 5G antennas.I am missing the 3.5 headphone jacks, most USB-C ones are still meh, and I dislike Bluetooth earbuds -- latency, so hopefully tech will catch-up.Happy with the purchase. Near top specs at a decent price point. Most importantly the support from the manufacturer, my 5T is on Android 10, and there is already a planned roll out for the 7T to get Android 11.Edit: I just want to confirm that the phone does accept dual SIMs. Need to purchase the tray; tested with a Sprint SIMS card."", ""I was looking for a OnePlus 7T for my sister as she was looking to upgrade from her Samsung Galaxy S6. I wasn't completely sure about it but I figured if anything went wrong, Amazon would be able to help me out as I had never bought a phone off Amazon before.The phone came really quickly, package all sealed and pristine so it was definitely a brand new phone. The setup was quick, and the phone lives up to the experience that tech reviewers had. The blue is also a gorgeous hue.My only gripe is the IMEI number is imprinted onto the back of the device under the OnePlus logo near the bottom (hence I've blocked them out in the photos attached). Other than that, she's been loving the device. I installed GCam to improve the camera performance and now the phone is basically perfect. My sister is very satisfied with it. A great value, and works fine on Bell's network here in Canada."", ""Did a lot of research to find my next phone and settled on the 7t based on the many glowing reviews from various tech media outlets. The 7t is no longer being made so are getting hard to find in new condition. I wanted the unlocked version and OnePlus only has the locked T-Mobile version at their website - which was the same price as this model. My biggest concern was who was the seller and is this really a brand new unlocked phone?Short answer - yes, it is a legit straight from the factory unlocked 7t fully sealed in the original factory package. The box contained everything it should and the phone was pristine.As for the phone itself, it lives up to its glowing recommendations and I am thrilled with it. For those who dock stars because the phone didn't work with the Verizon network, I don't know what to say. The listing couldn't be more clear about this phone not being well suited for Verizon customers."", ""This was a replacement for my wife's phone as she destroyed hers with an accident. She had a OnePlus 7T and loved it, so I bought her another. My daughter and a couple of her friends tried my wife's phone and all switched and got the OnePlus 7T. As for me...I'm a 'flip phone' type of guy and don't need all the bells and whistles."", ""This is a freaking incredible device. However, I am a Verizon customer, and while the unlocked OnePlus 7T has been certified to work on Verizons network, I am still unable to receive text messages. That is my only issue on this device. I have talked for hours to customer service from both Verizon and OnePlus and it honestly seems like no one has any idea what they're doing with this phone. Not to mention if you Google OnePlus and Verizon you'll see that even the new OnePlus 8 (sold by Verizon!) was having activation and service issues. Given how great this device is, I would have to have to send it back before my 30 days simply because Verizon cannot enable CDMA-less provisioning because my IMEI is not in their database. Things would be much better if there were any kind of timeframe as to when this issue may be fixed, but as of right now I constantly have to have my old device nearby to swap the SIM and check for any new text messages.

VERY slow, when you DO get to the point where you can start texting.  Has several menus of what TYPE of texting you are going to do; symbols are on a completely different area to get to, finding contacts is complicated...each letter you type in sits and blinks for several seconds before moving to the next letter, which I find exhausting and frankly just pisses me off.  I contacted Kyocera, and they said that's just the way they are.I could text on my Tundra without even looking at it.

It just stated that something went wrong and to call a number. I mean where are the prompt screens asking to establish passwords and account information that a normal linux install asks for? I had to take it to a Verizon store to activate it because of this.  Charging the phone is wonky, sometimes it charges, sometimes it DOES NOT. My old dumbphone would just charge when plugged in as does my Kindle.  Turning it on is weird as one has to hold the on button down for a number of seconds. I mean that’s how one turns off a desktop PC if it is hung up and yet this turns on this phone which is basically a micro PC.  The GUI is a disaster and it will take months if not years to figure out. What is wrong with a Win 9x GUI (Trinity rocks)?  The buttons do not do the same thing every time, so trying to figure out the commands is proving to be almost impossible.  My Kindle is recognized as an external drive as soon I plug it in my desktop PC and when I poked around this phone it looked like it would do the same as a Kindle but NOTHING. So all the features it brags about like the phone being a music player do not work easily if at all.  If this phone had a Win 9x GUI  it might actually be a good phone but with the difficulty of charging it and the horrible GUI it has it is barely usable.', 'great phone']"

And I wanted to get this UMIDIGI S5 Pro because of the very good specs like Helio G90T gaming processor, 6GB RAM, 256 GB ROM, and Global bands at this price range, those were main selling point for me... I don't usually sped $1000s of dollars for the new Flagship devices....And so far I can say I was not disappointed:Pros:It is pretty snappy and fast phone, compared to my old phone ZTE AXON 7, which had a Snapdragon 820, and 4GB RAM, and 64 GB ROM, this phone is probably twice as much faster.It has global bands and VoLTE, can work anywhere in the world and at any GSM company, I am using it with Metropcs in USA, so far works better than my AXON 7, which had connection issues inside of my home and at work.6GB LPDDR4x RAM is plenty of ram for the downloading a lot of apps, and it will not slow down your phone a lot256 ROM, that is insane amount of storage...Android 1048 megapixel QUAD camera, with pop up selfie18W fast charging, charged 40 % in less than an hourCame with the cover protector and on screen film installed, and Usb type C to regular headphone jack dongleLiquid cooling system, have not tested  on this phone yet, can't tell, but this technology is great, it is usually used in Server computers4680 MAH battery does last about 1.5 -2 days on moderate usageNFCNot very thick, fits comfortable on the hand, (little hard to use it one hand though if you have smaller palms)Dual sim card slots, and I could go on and on... Cons:Screen resolution could be better, it is 2k ( but again for this price point I am not complaining)On screen fingerprint reader works good, but not that fast in my opinionNo regular headphone jack ( but most companies are switching to Type C now anyways, and Umidigi provided free adapter dongle which is good)I am not sure why, I still need to test it but once in a while screen freezes for some reason during scrolling or reading some pages, not very often, but wanted to mention.Hopefully Umidigi will keep up with software updates on this phone.But overall I am very happy with this phone so far, It was a very good upgrade from my previous phone... It has all of the basic main features I need Speed and Enough memory."", 'The umidigi s5 pro is without a doubt one of the most capable phones on the market at this price point. I\'m somewhat of a tech nerd and I\'ve used a ton of different phones over the years. The S5 pro is simply my favorite phone that I also think is very underappreciated.To clarify, I have never owned a ""flagship"" phone, but most of my friends have $1000 phones and I have used them/seen them use them very often. For the average consumer, this phone isn\'t just a good competitor: it\'s on the same level as phones that cost a minimum of $600.Let\'s look at some of the advertised features:1) amoled screen: really does look phenomenal2) in display fingerprint scanner: very accurate with a cool animation and haptic feedback. It certainly isn\'t the fastest but it\'s still relatively new technology that\'s typically on much pricier phones3) Helio G90T ""Gaming Processor"": it really is a powerful processor. This phone is actually fortnite compatible, unlike most Mediatek devices. I have played fortnite, Sky: Children of Light, and dead cells and they all look and run excellent.4) liquid cooling system: I have no way of verifying it\'s effectiveness but the phone does stay relatively cool5) 256 gigs of storage is absurd value for the price6) ""48 megapixel AI Quad Camera"": one area where this phone can\'t quite match the $1000 options. However, the pictures still look great and there are some really neat options and settings included.7) motorized pop-up camera: works perfectly, it\'s ultimately preference. I do see why some people would prefer a normal camera notch but this is an extremely interesting and premium feature. It is ""slow"" compared to some, but in all actuality it doesn\'t take long at all.The battery is great, and the loudspeaker actually sounds pretty good as well. The entire build quality is as good as any devivice out there. It also looks stunning.Finally, let\'s talk about some cons:1) most likely will not receive any Android system updates2)case options are really limited, but it is nice that a basic one comes with it.3) no headphone jack (it does include an adapter though)The biggest pro of all is the fact that is has support for nearly all the US lte bands. Unlike some other big-name manufacturers (you know who I\'m talking about) who also produce good value phones. This really separates Umidigi phones from the competition and it\'s why I love them.', ""2 yr update- still in love with it. Some folks may not like not getting android updates but that's one of the things I love, since it means carriers can't add their crap which is difficult if not impossible to delete.In my case, altho my phone is factory unlocked, tmobile tries to force its own updates on me. The sneaks want to change permissions in order to access apps but their attempts fail because they're tied to Android updates, which are unavailable on this model. The only issue I've had is that the battery has to be charged frequently, and runs hot. Other than that, I think it's the best phone out there-- still!As much as I love it, I'm looking at the a13 pro because I want 5g connectivity now. But oddly, umidigi's newer models don't compare. Maybe they started at the top and then broke the mold :-)Orig review-This is a great phone at a great price -  at least I think it probably is. I don't get to use it much because my granddaughter keeps taking off with it. She says it's fantastic and thinks I'd love it too, as if she forgets it's actually my phone.Guess I'll have to order another for myself. I like the screen size and especially the absence of all the typical junk that comes pre-loaded nowadays. The power and volume buttons are easy to find by feel due to teeny nubs on them. Love the huge memory capacity and zoom camera. Hubby got one first and says it's ideal for his business needs and now prefers it to his iPhone. Granddaughter says the included case is a good idea, as without it the phone itself is slick as snot."", ""TL;DR Everything so far has just worked well and smoothly. It comes with the open version of the Google apps (calendar, calculator, contacts, phone, etc.) but it is quick and easy to add the actual Google apps and get everything working.The finger print reader is cool technology but a little slow compared to the highest end readers. Still looks so cool using it though.It doesn't support face unlock by default, but if you do some tweaking it can (root required).It's quick workout any slow downs so far, and the battery is decent laying me more than a day but I don't game enough to really tax it.The AMOLED screen is bright, very vibrant, and has rich blacks. I missed having one of these gorgeous screens with my old brick phone.I haven't tested the camera much, the pics I have seen are decent and low light has less noise than my last couple of phones by a large margin.I am using this on T-Mobile in the USA without issue, supporting wifi calling and VoLTE completely. If you turn VoLTE off the phone falls back to GPRS and EVO when calling and won't access internet at all, so really need to have it on."", ""I love this phone.... when it can find the internet. I went from a phone that was slow and picked up the internet well, to a phone that is super fast but can't get the bars. So, at least I'm used to waiting. For apps that don't need the internet the whole time, this phone is stellar. The camera is amazing, the screen size is great, and the complaints others had about the fingerprint reader have not at all been my experience. I did set up multiple prints to make it easier on me though. I love that I can get whatever app I want without worrying about taking up too much space, however, there does not seem to be a way to sort the apps. I just made little folders with the icons :) I do suggest this if you have strong internet signals, but I would avoid it if you have trouble with that generally with your providers."", ""Hardware's a great value for the money... just look at those specs right?Problem is the software has quite a few problems.

Hit favorites, then contacts, and you're good.- Wifi calling doesn't work well, and can't be turned off independently of wifi. I end up having to manually turn off wifi whenever a call needs to happen.- Bluetooth doesn't send song info from any apps.

Normally be used tools to stabilize the video but making a video from your hands it's going to come out very shaky unless you put it on the side or you buy the device to stabilize it, camera quality is okay not that bad there's a filter to your face but I would say for the price i paid it's okay.

I like to experiment with different brands of tech outside of the mainstream name-brands and to be honest, I really don't see the need to drop $500+ when something as highly spec'd and as well built as this is available. Granted, there are better phones out there, but they will cost you far more.Anyways, just some pros to note for me - 1) 256GB of expandable storage is CRAZY for $300 2) AMOLED display is excellent with wonderful color replication and accuracy 3) Camera quality is superb 4) Helio G90T packs a serious punch 5) Build quality is exceptional 6) STOCK ANDROID! 7) They include a USB C to 3.5mm jack cable which is very much so appreciated!I really don't have anything bad to say either. If it had cost more, yeah, maybe. But like I've said, the price is so competitive, that any possible detriments are easily overlooked and so far, I can't identify any worth noting.""]"

È il mio primo LG ma è anche l ultimo cellulare di tanti che ho avuto..e dopo 1 settimana di uso per me è promosso a PIENI VOTI .Il mini confronto lo faccio col mio ultimo ""compagno"" che uso ancora, cioè l ottimo xiaomi mi9T ed lg G9 velvet ne esce vincente sotto TUTTI gli aspetti. In ordine casuale:1) ricezione segnale GSM migliore, riesce ad agganciare meglio dove il Segnale è debole(gli operatori però sono diversi, wind su lg e iliad su xiaomi)2) schermo migliore su lg anche se di poco, ma soprattutto le dimensioni aiutano a fruire molto meglio dei contenuti multimediali(libri video internet)e le cornici arrotondate sono piacevoli3) audio stereo piacevolissimo, e in cuffia una bomba;due spanne sopra mi9T4) fotocamere superiori in ogni aspetto nonostante i moduli siano quasi tutti affogati nello chassis5) velocità della connessione nettamente superiore nonostante non sia attivo il 5G6) qualità costruttiva eccellente e meglio ottimizzate le cornici. Sono sorpreso di come lg sia riuscita a tenere il peso sui 180gr e uno spessore di neanche 8mm su un display da quasi 7 pollici ; lavoro eccezionale7) BATTERIA: personalmente mi sto trovando molto bene, meglio dello Xiaomi (4300mah vs 4000mah) ma forse sarà più attendibile tra qualche settimana.8) CAPITOLO A PARTE sui PLUS, cioè funzione desktop, collegamento video tv, doppio schermo, pennino. Queste 4 caratteristiche rendono il Velvet G9 UNICO. Ho provato solo le prime due ed è fantastico attaccare il cellulare su un tv da 55/65 pollici tramite cavo hdmi e vedere riprodotto perfettamente ciò che c\'è sul telefono, dalle foto ai video ai videogiochi.. Tutto è fruibile facilmente anche a distanza collegando un mouse bluetooth o un pad , sono rapito da questa possibilità e dalle sue potenzialità che sto solo ora esplorando per la prima volta. La FUNZIONE DESKTOP è simpatica ma può essere sviluppata tanto. il DOPPIO SCHERMO e il PENNINO WACOM non li ho provato ma presto mi arriveranno. Sul primo ho letto recensioni entusiastiche.N. B. IMPORTANTE : In questi giorni di caldo lo xiaomi sotto al sole è andato spesso in ""protezione"" causa over heating, il Velvet neanche 1 volta eppure entrambi sono color nero.Grazie dell attenzione e buon acquisto.

A more readable PDF user\'s manual can be found online.

These apps can not be deleted outright. Not being able to remove these apps means that this phone is NOT fully unlocked. This isn\'t a major problem on a device with 128GB of storage.

Because of this, I had to move from a phone in the budget premium segment to a higher trim phone within the midrange segment. I will be writing this review from this perspective. I have been using this phone as my main device since the 4th of July, and I\'ve written this review after using this phone for a little under two weeks.One of the biggest things that got my eye was the beautiful Samsung AMOLED display. It is on par with, if not better than my older OnePlus 7. The blacks are beautiful and I could tell that MI did not skimp out on this segment. However, I do feel that their touch sensor could use some improvement, as I find myself mistouching a lot of buttons on it. Also, the screen tends to have a significant flashing problem, especially during the night. While I don\'t think this is a very frequent issue, do keep this in mind when making a purchase. Another great thing about the screen is the refresh rate. While 120 Hz does make a noticeable difference to the speed at which images and frames move, over time it didn\'t feel too prominent. Also, most websites do not have the silky smooth scrolling, thus, making it feel a bit alienating. That being said, the refresh rate is very noticeable for sure.The build quality of the phone is quite good for the price. While the phone does have a plastic back, it doesn\'t feel cheap and feels quite sturdy in the hand. The aluminum sides give it a very premium look, even when coupled with the glass back. That being said, having seen the durability tests on youtube, which seemed to highlight that the phone has a lot of vulnerabilities in the build sturdiness. So I\'d recommend treating this phone and putting a case on it if using it.The software experience is not too bad. I love the amount of customisation MIUI offers, from the huge selection of user made themes available, to the smaller quality of life changes from the ability to hide the notch to the ability to go as far as changing the phones font. However I did notice that the phone forces apps to go an dark mode when dark mode is turned on, which causes some images appear incorrectly on the apps. Also, there are times when the screen goes completely unresponsive, and forcing a shutdown is the only way to get the phone back to normal. Other than this, the software is good. A major plus is the fact that the phone comes with Android 11 out of the box, and the phone doesn\'t have any heating issues. The only time I noticed heating issues is when the phone was running a video call in windowed mode. Since this puts the phone under a considerable amount of load, I would give it a pass. Another thing I would like to bring to light is the fact that flashing an custom ROM will take a few days, as MI seems to have a weird approval system.A major positive about the phone is the camera. The camera works wonderfully, whether the app being used is the stock camera or GCam. When compared to GCam, the stock camera seems to churn out more brighter images. However, I think that GCam churns out more ""accurate"" images. There is an beautification effect on selfies which is not very noticeable on the stock camera app, but when compared to images taken through GCam, which are a lot more accurate, it becomes very obvious. To sum up the camera performance however, it is excellent and extremely reliable. Definitely worth going for if you want to take great high quality pictures. The Wide Angle camera could use some improvement, but the Macro and the main 64 MP shooter are absolutely wonderful.I cannot comment on the battery life yet as I haven\'t used my phone for a full day outside yet. But from what I can tell the battery has given me 8 hours SOT on light usage when going from 30-100, which is impressive. The battery doesn\'t discharge fast as well. However, it is to be noted that I mostly use my phone on the 60 Hz setting, so my results can vary greatly from the others. The phone charges fast enough, but since I rarely charge my phone to a full battery, preferring to do it in small spurts instead, I cannot say much about the charging speed other than saying that it charges fast.One positive change that Xiaomi seemed to have implemented in the current set of phones is the fact that there are no ads inbuilt in important UI areas, like settings and the notification bar. Having used the Redmi Note 4 in the past, I can tell that this used to be the case for their older devices. This seems to have been done in response to pressure from users and influencers. That being said, their inbuilt preloaded applications do display many advertisements through notifications and can easily be turned off by stopping notifications from said apps. Once this is done, then you won\'t see advertisements in the phone at all. I must note that Xiaomi\'s business model for their budget devices revolves around these advertisements (they refer to it as services), it is to be expected in their Redmi line of devices. I am pointing this out to show that there is an extra cost the end user pays for due to the low budget margins of these budget devices, and that cost comes in the form of these advertisements in the UI. This business model is implemented so that they can offer better value as compared to their competitors.While I am not a huge mobile gamer anymore, I have tried playing Battlegrounds India for around half an hour just to see how it was. The game worked well, and there didn\'t seem to be much of a difference in real time performance as compared to my older OnePlus 7. I did not notice any heating on the device. However, it is to be noted that the OnePlus 7 has a much higher AnTuTu benchmark rating as compared to this phone. While this phone is certainly not a slouch when it comes to gaming, I think that the POCO X3 Pro is a much better pick than the Redmi Note 10 Pro if gaming is a priority given its powerful SD 860 chipset.The speakers are really loud and play music really clearly. They work significantly better than the speakers on my older OnePlus device. I was also happy to get the headphone jack back as well, and it works well with my current KZ Edx OEMs. I\'m happy to note that the phone provides the option to expand storage which I definitely will be taking advantage of in the future.So, to sum it up, the phone is a good pick in this price range, due to its well rounded offerings. The camera, the display, the speakers, and the battery life come together to make this phone a good package. There are minor hitches with the software that could be improved in the future, and the vulnerabilities in the build are a cause for concern. However, as long as used properly and carefully, I really don\'t think that anything will happen to the device.Salient points from the above observations:1. The phone has a good and premium looking design. However there are questions about the durability.2. The phone has a great and reliable camera, human faces are given a ""beautification"" effect by the stock camera.3. There are issues with the software, such as a flashing display and an aggressive dark mode, along with random freezes.4. The battery life is quite decent and the phone lasts long.5. Has an acceptable gaming performance, but there are better picks in this price range for this purpose, like the POCO X3 Pro.6. Ads are only present in the pre-loaded apps, can be disabled by turning off all notifications from these apps.7. The phone has a wait time before allowing the bootloader to be unlocked, to be noted if you want to flash a ROM on this device.10. Has a beautiful display that competes strongly with my older OnePlus 7.Note: I have not used the Fingerprint sensor as I don\'t want to store my biometric data on the device.', 'Nice product value of money', 'Buying a phone these days have become a mammoth task, you spend hours & days in ""techy youtube videos"" & adding more to the pain is OPPO, VIVO & Realme ... (these guys launch a new phone almost every fortnightly).This is my first ""MI"" phone (Obviously the trust issue), Looking at the specs it seems to be a all rounder & yes purely it is.. It does the job in Camera, screen, connectivity & battery..I\'m not a gamer, youtuber, tiktoker or anyone else for that matter, Just a regular guys who uses phone for,1) Calling - Which is good on this phone (no issue with any Indian network)2) Wifi support - does connect to wifi to browse internet3) Camera - Does take good pictures (for bigger events i use my DSLR)4) Display - Good for watching short time videos (for movies i use my TV or laptop)5) Battery - It does power up my 1n half day (i don\'t live on Mars so i have electricity at my place & not that busy that i can\'t charge my phone)6) Speakers - Yes loud enough to disturb other (Not a Sound expert can\'t define how may decibels the speaker makes)7) Processor - I don\'t know how thick it is (the nano meter) but it fits inside my phone & works fine.8) Headphone Jack - yes, it is available - you need to buy one separately not included in the box, as MI thought we already have headphones, like apple way.Overall, no matter how much you load your phone with feature either Hardware & software, this will not replace core devices which are meant for the sol purpose (like camera, sound systems, TV\'s, gaming console)Before buying anything these days don\'t go for online reviews, first understand what is your requirement & how long you will be using that thing.', 'Cons1. Seller charging full price for a 2 year old phonePros1. Note 11Pro has bad specifications. Version 12 and 13 drop important things like dedicated microSD card slot,3.5mm headphone jack, FM radio etc.2. Slightly better screen than 9.3. One of the last phones to give charger in the box!', ""A wonderful phone but some drawbacks too.I am writing this review after using (actually not using because this is my stand by phone) this phone after 15 days.Display-  This is my third sAmoLED display phone. First is Mi A3 and second is Samsung M31. It has better display than Samsung M31 and Mi A3 but my brother's very old Samsung C9 has better display than this.  Clear view in direct sunlight too. Colours are original but over shined. Viewing full HD videos are aweaome.For display 4 out of 5Camera- Camera is awesome with a new feature dual mode by which we can use front and back camera simultaneously in video mode. Same feature was in my Micromax A310 (Canvas Nitro) nearly 8 years back but in still camera mode only.Macro Mode is average but All other are superb till I update it to latest MIUI 12.5.9 version. Now it's rear camera capture nature photos quite good but on faces it show very dark patches just like black marks on faces. It is it's biggest drawback. Front camera is still acceptable For rear camera 2.5 out of 5. For front camera 4 out of 5.Sound- Sound Quality is good when it is below 90% but in full volume sound is bursting in low pitch music. DTS Dolby is also new for me so I can not judge it but I think dual stereo speaker should have be equal in sound. Bottom speaker fires more sound than top speaker but it is still better than Realme 8/Pro series. For sound 4 out of 5Battery- I use this set as my standby set. In 15 day I barely make/receive 5 calls on this number. I put my Data SIM in this phone and use it as a Wi-Fi device through hotspot. I use POCO M2 as my primary phone. I don't use Facebook, WhatsApp type social media Apps, also I don't fond of online listening/watching audio/video songs/movies, I also not a game addict and net surfer. So my use of smart phone is limited to sending mails, making/receiving calls and texts for which my POCO M2 is still priority phone because call log or sms log back up to other phone is still not possible. Still In that scenario my nearly 1 year old POCO M2 gives better battery backup than this phone. after overnight charge in morning there is 100% battery in both phones. I enable data and personal hotspot in Redmi Note 10 Pro Max and use POCO M2 through Wi-Fi. calling/mailing/net surfing all are done by POCO M2. This phone kept in pocket whole day without taking out once. In night POCO M2 shows 50-60% battery left and Redmi Note 10 Pro Max 40-50%. One thing also noticeable that I use POCO M2's 10w charger to charge both phone. I didn't take out Redmi Note 10 Pro Max 33w charger because both phone have Type C ports. So why unnecessary use 2 charger and took one more wall socket reserve for another phone? because my wife also use 2 phones, 1 is her personal and another is given from her office. So there are 4 phones, all with type C charging point. So I use 1 charger for all phones. If charging this phone with a 10w charger is not an issue then it has a very poor battery backup. I'll give 2.5 points out of 5Processor- It doesn't matter for me. I never be in race of high speed data downloading. downloading 1GB file in 10 minutes or 15 minutes is not matter with me. still it has a good downloading speed. We have Jio Tower on our roof. So 4 Points out of 5.Other- Heptic is irritating.can not switch refresh rate between 120 to 60 Hertz. either use 60 Hertz or 120 Hertz there is no middle option.call record option is missing. needs 3rd party apps to record calls without secrecy (other person will know that you are recording his/her call as there is a loud notification sound 'your call is recording now'.There are a few bloatware which can not be uninstalled.I'll give only 1 point out of 5 for these drawback.and it is a little bit pricey too. As Motorola, Realme, Oppo, POCO etc. are give 5G enabled phone in nearly 20% less price than this.overall this is a worth buying. A few drawbacks can not overshadowed it's qualities. Nice Display, Sound Quality and Processor make it a better phone than it's competitors."", 'Bought this in August 2022, camera is good unless it\'s very low light , no lag whatsoever, phone looks beautiful from every angle. Screen is crisp . Though from a recent update sometimes my phone comes up with ""system UI has stopped responding"" alerts  which is a bit annoying. Still no regrets.', 'NiceBut battery drains fast', 'As reviewed by many, this is not a gaming phone. Touch lags a lot while gaming.I am writing this review after thorough two months of usage.Mi OS\'s dual space and daul apps are added advantage.Battery is excellent, in one and quarter hours the battery gets full, even if only 5% of batt was left. Full charged battery goes for full day calls, video editing, uploading, WA, telegram or YouTube in 4k, it will last for whole day, from 900am to 20% till 1200 am. A 33watt charger is provided with this phone.Screen is super Amoled, I can easily read the screen in direct Sun light. Many are complaining about flickering in screen. This is because it is not a back illuminated LCD, it is an amoled! Flickering is due to refreshing of LEDs, it is inherent with this technology.I was not able to see any prominent difference between 60hz and 120hz refreshing of screen. I have chosen 60hz refresh rate, saves battery.Super Amoled screen is so cool to watch, (I have always used IPC or LCD screen phones) its clarity and crispness is incomparable with older technology. You will never go back to LCD screen ever ;)Speakers of this phone is Awesome. You can hear them in noisy streets, even with 90% volume. ""Dolby Atmos"" is provided with stereo speakers. One is on the top of mobile other is bottom of it. They really surround you with sound.Camera is just for day today average shooting. Strangely stabilization is provided in 4k video recording but no stabilization in photo shoot. Without stabilization photos get blurry. I think MI will update their software.Processor is both good and bad, it is an octa core processor but only two of them are Power CPUs, six of them are low power CPUs. This is a good compromise for a budget phone but this shows up when you use it for gaming or high speed scrolling.Look of the phone is Awesome. You get gorilla glass 5 both on front and back side. A feature found only in high end phones. Shiny backside gives illusion of metal body. It is plastic actually.A guard is provided with the phone, screen comes with slim plastic protector (despite of gorilla glass 5!).Always on feature of screen is awesome but sometimes gets stuck with fingerprint unlock.Fingerprint unlock is provided on the side and is snappy. Unlocks phone in a jiffy.In all, this mobile is a great purchase. Go on and order it, if you are looking for a budget decent phone. You will not be disappointed.', 'The cameras are not working after MIUI 14 update. Really disappointed with Redmi.', 'Display is impressive.Rich sound with speakers.No Connectivity issues.Performance with 732g is decent no heavy gaming can be expected.Cameras are OK type at this budget.Battery can be improved more. Degrades to quickly.MIUI sucks']"

I like that it has a 64G internal memory and I purchased a 128G SD card for it. My two favorite things is the fingerprint sign in and the stylus pen for note-taking. The phone is very sleek and fits very well in my hand."", ""I'm not an expert on cell phones by any means, but here are my pros and cons on the LG K31. Pro: Received cell well packaged, setting up phone settings and SIM card with Verizon was easy (you can get the SIM card for free), lightweight and slim (if you like that), takes good pictures, sound quality good and loud, takes videos well (although you have to be careful not cover the mic). Cons: On occasion, the screen turns off like if you've pressed the power button to save power, but cell doesn't shut down completely. The screen is sensitive to touch and can be adjusted. However, there are set spot to where it can be adjusted. It will not be adjusted in small increments. Positioning of mic at the bottom of the phone, not good as sometimes the palm of your hand can end up blocking it, while recording. That's what happened to me and you could barely hear the sound.  Other than that, I think overall it's a pretty good phone to have."", 'Surprise!  We finally found a good quality, basic phone that we actually got activated on the Verizon Wireless network.  After long, fruitless searches on the Verizon website - rated Total Fail for offering to basic phone users only poorly rated phones at outrageous prices - we tried two big box stores.  Error.  We purchased two phones that they guaranteed were Verizon compatible.  Each time, we spent over two hours driving around and waiting in lines to be told by sneering Verizon employees that the phones could not be activated on their network.Burned by Verizon and by in-person shopping at retailers well-known for tech expertise, we were more-than-hesitant to try an unseen, potential pig-in-a-poke phone advertised on Amazon.  It took hours of frustrating searching to find what we were looking for on Amazon, but as it turned out, the searching paid off.The LG K31 is everything a basic phone user wants.  Right size and weight.  Easy to set up and use.  Enough memory and battery life for ""everyday"" use.  Decent enough camera.  Clear display.  Good selection of onboard apps, without massive bloatware.  It\'s a 2020 phone, so the features are up-to-date, and we were pleased to find a selection of screen protectors and cases already available on Amazon.If your phone is your life, this isn\'t the phone for you, of course.  But if you want basic communication (voice and text), social media, entertainment and record-keeping (photos, videos, notes, etc.) in a Verizon compatible device at a very reasonable price, the LG K31 may be just what you\'re looking for.', ""I wanted to find an android phone with a smaller screen, and this is about the only one left.  I have used the phone for several months now.  The best feature is the long battery life.  Other than that, its a so-so phone, there's a glitch a day on one app or another.  I'd say it's a little overpriced for such a basic phone, but it works fine."", 'I was able to use this device on the Consumer Cellular network for several weeks. Today it suddenly will not send or receive calls. Spent the afternoon chatting with C.C. techs, changing settings, trying test calls. Not luck! MMS and data only. No more calls.', ""I love everything about the LG K51 phone. It's pretty fast, and a much longer lasting battery then my last Samsung device. I find it's a good 2-3 days (depending on the use) before I have to set my phone on the charger (that's usually on 50-60% at that point! The only thing I DID NOT  like about the device, is the fact the it's a TMobile/Metro Device (as Tmobile and Metro merged some time ago). I advertises Metro, including when the phone is turned on. You will also get Metro ads randomly popping up (I was able to fix this in settings). I have TMobile and was able to activate this phone with no problems! I loved that it is also super easy to activate as well! Great job LG!"", ""I bought this phone thinking I could use it with my free government service.  I bought the same exact phone from my carrier and returned this one.  It came also with Android 10.  Good battery life, but don't let it go below 60 percent charge for best battery life expectancy.  That is good advice for any rechargeable battery-powered product from my experience, but it can be used to fully-discharged state.  With 32 gigabyte internal memory, I am using also a 32-GB top-end SD card.  Good volume from phone earpiece.  Good volume from speakerphone.  Earpiece is at the top, facing the user, speakerphone speaker is out the bottom facing down.  Both speakers play Left and Right channel stereo.  Good app for optimizing the phone is found in the Management folder.If the person on the other end has weak hearing, use of the speakerphone boosts the microphone gain and boosts your voice to the other person."", 'Phone arrived mostly intact despite being packaged in an unpadded manila envelope with only a very thin padding wrap around the phone itself...No SIM Tray Opener included as defined in item description!']"

I wanted a SMALL phone that would fit in all of my pockets easily, and this was it. It's got abominable battery life so that if I'm on it for more than a couple hours it's dead and some apps aren't available on it (very, very few - 1/30 I downloaded). But that's easy for me to navigate, I don't use my phone a ton anyways and carry a charger on me. The camera is legit, and it does all of the normal phone things (it is sim compatible, check with your carrier). I like the tiny smartphone (I've been using it for 3ish months now). It has a couple small, but also pretty easily manageable glitches in the back button and visual voicemail."", ""I think I like this phone. I've had it about 2 weeks and use it as my primary phone. Yes the battery life is short but that's partly the point of this phone. It's meant to be put in your pocket and mostly not used. Phone calls and a few texts don't kill the battery, surfing does. I bought it to keep from surfing so much on the phone so it's a win. And yes, it's worked at keeping me off the socials, newspapers and work crap.If I start a day with a full charge pocket it and forget about it, it's at 40% by bed time. A 2 hour bike ride listening to Bluetooth music stored on the phone uses about 40-50% of the battery. Generally I plug it in once during the day if it needs it and don't have issues.I've switched at work now to using spotify on my computer to headphones rather than from the phone.

I wish more companies made phones this size. It does take some time to get used to texting.One issue with it is the battery doesn't last long. I charge it once every 1.5 days. I keep the WIFI and BT. In that time I make maybe 1 call and a half dozen texts. That is not a big deal for me since I am always near a power source. I think palm could easily improve the battery life by making the phone a few mm thicker.As an aside I did purchase a juice pack to try to extend the battery life, but the juice pack attenuated the RF signal enough to block reception at my home.

For that purpose it's great.They really need to improve the battery life though - all the battery packs I purchased reduce the reception down to zero when on the phone so you can't make or receive calls or messages which is really stupid.I'm happy with the purchase since I like small things and hate bulk but it's definitely a niche market for frivolous consumers."", ""Disappointed with this phone.

If I turn my head to either direction, my earbuds lose signal. Now it's not the earbuds, I can leave my other phone on the bench and walk around my workshop and bluetooth works fine. The actual reception to the mobile network isn't that strong either. There are places I run with my larger phone and not lose LTE signal, this phone constantly loses signal which prevents me from streaming....which is the main purpose of this phone.

Nein, nicht wegen des Funknetzstandards. Deutschland hat schon mit 2,3 und 4G Versorgungsnöte. Nur die Endung 5G beinhaltet auch die enormen technischen und softwareseitigen Unterschiede zur Version ohne 5G.Das Huawei P40 lite 5G ist ein hervorragend gelungenes Smartphone. Die Grundfunktionen wie Telefonieren, Fotografieren und Webanwendungen nutzen beherrscht dieses Telefon sehr gut. Der ""Makel"", keine Google Dienste installieren zu können, ist eher eine Befreiung als eine Benachteiligung. Alle Anwendungen funktionieren wie mit Google Diensten. Wichtig ist nur, Phone Clone und die Huawei oder Honor Cloud zur Sicherung zu nutzen. Z. B. WhatsApp\'s eigenes Chat-Backup versagt regelmäßig grandios. Whatsapp wird nach dem Wechsel über die Huawei Petal-Search mit integriertem Schadprogrammscanner installiert - und läuft dann wie gewohnt. Youtube wird via Browser und/oder Homescreen-Verknüpfung genutzt. Mails über hauseigene Mail-App oder Microsoft Outlook abrufbar.

‎PAH10002US,Moto G Stylus | 2020 | Unlocked | Made for US by Motorola | 4/128GB | 48MP Camera | Indigo,Smartphones,S$222.77,https://www.amazon.sg/Stylus-Unlocked-Motorola-Camera-Indigo/dp/B087H9FDRM/ref=sr_1_332?qid=1695968269&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051%2Cp_72%3A6469119051%2Cp_36%3A20000-150000&rnid=6450031051&s=electronics&sr=1-332,https://www.amazon.sg/Stylus-Unlocked-Motorola-Camera-Indigo/product-reviews/B087H9FDRM/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,4.3,"['Well, lets start out with the obvious, this is not a contender against ANY flagship phone.  If your looking for all the bells and whistles of a flagship phone at this price, you need to have your head examined.That said, if you looking for one of the best value phones from 2020 then this is clearly it.I did a huge amount of research before purchasing this phone.  In fact, my friend just purchased the Moto G Power 2021 two weeks before I got this one.  And honestly I almost got that phone.  But after an exhaustive search for a Zizo bolt case for that phone.  I could not find one anywhere on Amazon.  But on page 26 of my search, I did find this phone\'s case.  And thus the research began.As it turns out, with the exception of the extra 1,000ah battery and slightly larger display this phones specs far out weighed that phone.  For starters, the display on the Moto G Stylus 2020 has a much better quality display.It has a better pixel density.  It has a cleaner look when looking at the display.  I have had both of these phonesside by side and when looking at them directly, this phone\'s display looks cleaner and not as grainy.  The Moto G Power 2021 has a bright sparkly output that is actually hard on the eyes.  The Moto G Stylus to me comes as close to a Amoled display as I think a budget IPS display gets.  The colors a good and robust and I never have to worry about display burn from a Amoled display again.It has really good stereo speakers and you can absolutely tell the difference.The camera\'s are freaking awesome for such a low level phone.  I have played with all of them and even playedwith the ""Action Cam"".  It works very well.  Night mode isn\'t the greatest but does make my low light photos really clean without any of the nasty white noise that I got from my last cheap phone.If you need a panorama shot, it does still have the panorama software, it lets you take a sweeping shot ofthe entire area you want and then the software sews it back together.  It\'s actually pretty cool.Another difference between the two phones is the night mode pics.  The G Power 2021 takes almost twicethe amount of time to take the night mode pics as the Moto G Stylus.One of the coolest features I have found on this phone is the Moto Audio.  This feature should be on every smart phone.  It allows you to fine tune system wide audio from what ever source your playing to.Say for instance you plug in your headphones, yes it has a headphone jack.  It pops up and asks you if you want tofine tune the sound to your preference.  EQ, sound stage, extra base to name a few.  You can apply this to the stockspeakers, Bluetooth headset, Regular Headphones, Bluetooth speakers.  Every device can have it\'s own sound preference.  So if you have a set of cans that need some extra bass.  Boom, done.  Need some extra sound stage on that cheap Bluetooth stereo speaker.  Boom done.  Want  a custom sound on anything you use.  Boom, done.One more thing that I found really cool that I honestly didn\'t even think I was going to use was the Stylus.I know, I know.  Why the heck would you buy a Stylus phone and not use it.  Well, it was all the other features overthe G Power that really nailed it for me.  But,  I was working in a building the other day and needed to take some quick jots of measurements and thought, man I need a piece of paper and a pencil.  Hey, wait a minute.  Pulled out the stylus on my phone before even unlocking it and all of sudden, the app opens up and is ready for some notes.I was able to jot down all my measurements and when I put the stylus back in the hole, the app auto saved my notes and went back to sleep.  I was blown away at how simple and powerful this was.Now lets face it, this is not a drawing pad like the Samsung Note.  But it does pretty well at the basics.To me, the Stylus was not the high point of the phone.  But it does have it\'s place.This is just to name a few things that stand out to me.  I honestly don\'t have anything bad to say about this phone.It hits all the buttons and does it well.  It is pretty vanilla as an unlocked phone gets.  Very little bloatware, and a simple sim swap and I was up and running.  Verizon of course.I cleaned out all the garbage I didn\'t want as far as apps are concerned and added my own.I completely un-google all of my phones including the app store.  I get my apps from other known places.Battery life is freaking phenomenal.  I unplugged my phone at around 7am and admittedly did not use it muchas I was at work.  I picked it up to check for messages around 4pm and it was still at 100%If I use it normally, it\'s usually around 70% by around 10pm.  I\'ve only had it down to 50% once.Not sure what else to say.  Call quality is great.  Speaker phone is super clear and loud.  The finger lockis finicky if you work with your hands too much.  I just use a pin or swipe.  I still had my 15 watt charger frommy last Moto Z Play and it charges fairly quickly.  Hope that helps.I would take a picture of it, but hmmm it\'s my only decent camera now : pYou get the idea : )', 'The Moto G Stylus 2020 is a great phone and you can Google it to find all you need to know about its specs and performance. This review addresses the version bought from this page specifically.The phone was delivered pretty quickly and arrived brand new in a sealed box. I popped in my Rogers SIM card and it worked right away with no issue -- calls and SMS worked flawlessly and wi-fi connected quickly. The main annoyance, I discovered, is that the version being sold on this page is specifically from T-Mobile and as such it has a few apps (MetroPlay and MyMetro) that are meshed with the O.S. and cannot be uninstalled - only disabled. A T-Mobile splash screen will also appear every time you restart the phone. Unfortunately none of this is disclosed on this page.The most annoying of these apps was  MetroPlay,  similar to Google\'s News and which shared a screen with the latter on the left of the home screen. Even after I disabled it, it was still there. To get rid of it, I needed to disable it in Apps, then go in Home Settings > Swipe Access and choose ""Nothing"". This removed the news screen from both Google and Metroplay. Once this is done, I went back to Swipe Access and turn Google News back on and thankfully the T-Mobile one was no longer there.Note that the phone comes with Android 10 but you can update right away to Android 11. However even this will still not uninstall the Metro apps so you will still need to disable them if you do not want them.At $260, the Metro G Stylus is an easy 5 Stars for anybody who does not need all the bells and whistles of a flag ship phone. But I deducted 1 Star for the lack of transparency regarding the uninstallable apps.', ""So all was good until an app I use it says it won't download on this model phone. But I have the same model phone for my old device the screen was cracked and it began to act up and the carrier no longer sells my phone and I wanted the same one so ordered it on Amazon. I did all the updates to be up to date as the phone I was using. But that one app won't download. Didn't make sense. Now I can't use that app and it is one of my apps to save me money as I shop. Also it transferred all my messages over, but only pics sent in them messages. Left out all the important detailsstill trying to figure out how to get the written part of the messages. Frustrating. Never had this issue transferring data before.  Disappointed"", 'I bought the 2020 model for the better features. It seems like all the phone companies are down scalling features to reduce cost. I read many reviews which commented on the battery life. I\'ve been using the phone for a month and have had the battery last for about 3 days as I tested that feature. I think I\'m a normal phone user and do not watch videos or stream much. The only drain on the battery seems to be the GPS which is normal. I remove as much bloat wear as possible to reduce any unwanted overhead. The camera works fine for me but I don\'t have high demands for this feature. I hate that just about all phones have sealed batteries so they can advertize better water resistant features.  My old phone, a G5 Plus required the entire motherboard be disassembled to change the battery. This phone attached easily to ""Phone Link"" on my Windows PC.', ""It's an ok phone but I noticed the stylus is kinda scratchy & doesn't work very well and the camera gets a little blurry when zooming but for the price what can you expect."", 'Face recognition not present nor stylis', 'Has a good battery and the stylus pen is really fun for me and my artistic inclinations.', 'This phone is two years old and is the best phone in my opinion you can find still to this day. I absolutely love this phone.', ""You get what you pay for, this phone is super slow, glitchy, voice to text completely sucks. I guess if you really need a smartphone and don't want to shell out more than a few hundred dollars go ahead, but I wouldn't recommend this thing for any real use other than simple phone calls"", ""Wondering for sure I'll be glad when I finally figure out all the little quirks""]"

This phone is quite a nice upgrade in speed and storage over the One Plus 8.  I love the color.  I also got this at a price that was nearly $300 off the regular price which made it easy to select this.  I've read the 9 and 10 models aren't as good as the 8 and I was not going to pay full price for a newer phone.  This will work until I see the 11th generation is worth purchasing at a discounted rate.  Very pleased with the phone and speed."", ""I upgraded to the OnePlus 8 from a Pixel 2XL, and I have thoroughly enjoyed this phone so far! I was a little hesitant buying this phone (with some complaining about the camera, and so many other phones releasing this fall), but this phone has surpassed my expectations! I wasn't interested in the OnePlus 8 Pro because of the larger size/weight and more expensive price tag. The OnePlus 8 is close to the size of my Pixel 2XL, which is big enough for me. Personally, I don't really care about wireless charging or water resistance. Also, I read the pro has a more prominent waterfall screen (the screen wraps around the sides of the phone more), which I was not interested in.The screen is big and beautiful! The hole punch camera doesn't bother me at all, and I forget it is there most of the time. The 90hz screen was a huge selling point for me, and is a huge upgrade from a 60hz screen. It really makes the phone feel buttery smooth.Speaking of buttery smooth, this phone will handle anything you throw at it! The combination of the beefy specs (emphasis on the 8gb/12 gb of RAM) and OxygenOS make for an amazing experience. I am not a big mobile gamer, but I did try PUBG to check out the 90 fps mode, which works and gameplay is smooth/fluid.The battery life has been fantastic. It will definitely get though an entire day with heavy usage. The included 30w fast charger will charge up your phone super quick if you are in a rush. The phone also has battery optimization options that will help prevent the battery from degrading overtime.The on-screen fingerprint reader is very fast and I rarely have issues unlocking the phone. I have not tried face recognition, because I just prefer the fingerprint reader.The stereo speakers are pretty great, and I have no issues with the sound quality. I mostly use Bluetooth Bose earbuds with the phone, and haven't had any connection issues at all.The build quality is very premium and feels like a $1000 phone. Hepatic feedback (vibration) is something people overlook in reviews, and it feels great and is subtle. The power and volume buttons also feel nice and clicky. The power button on the Pixel 2 XL felt spongy, and sometimes wouldn't even register me pressing it (it was super annoying). The notification slider (ring/vibrate/silent) is useful and should be on more Android phones. The glass back also makes the phone feel premium, but it is super slippery. It is also a fingerprint magnet (interstellar glow). So maybe slap a case or a D-Brand skin on the back (although the interstellar glow looks beautiful).In my opinion, the camera is not nearly as bad as some people are saying. It still takes high quality photos, and software updates will only make it better. It isn't as easy as the pixel 2XL's camera and camera software, but it has potential! It definitely isn't on par with the OnePlus 8 pro or other $1000 phones, but it gets the job done. I am definitely not a photographer or photography enthusiast, so if you are looking for a phone that takes the best photos, maybe go with the OnePlus 8 pro. Also, the 2MP macro camera on this phone is pretty pointless (which may be my only negative point in this review). I know some people were having issues with the selfie camera (reports of blurry/fuzzy images), but I haven't had any problems with it so far.Overall, this is exactly the phone I wanted. A super fast phone (high specs and 90hz screen) that I didn't pay $1000+ for. I will never be able to go back to a phone with a 60hz screen!"", 'La caja llegó en excelentes condiciones, y sin desagradables sorpresas, ya que no tuve que pagar nada adicional al precio pactado, ni tuve que padecer las acostumbradas extorsiones aduanales.El contenido de la caja viene con todos los componentes que OnePlus declara en su portal. Ciertamente viene un folleto en chino mandarín (Información de producto), pero no es relevante, ya que también viene un folleto equivalente en varios idiomas.El cargador es para el tipo de enchufe del país de compra, en este caso México, por lo que no se necesita comprar ni usar ninguna clavija de conversión.Es excelente que ya venga incluida una funda, aparte de no tener que hacer inversiones adicionales para proteger el equipo, la funda es transparente, por lo que es posible continuar viendo el bello efecto de tonos y colores que refleja la capa inferior de vidrio en el modelo Brillo Interestelar.Un punto no publicitado es que tiene una bandeja dual nano sim, no la probé pues sólo tengo a la mano un sim, aunque de acuerdo a OnePlus, la habilitación del dual sim 5g/4g o 4g/4g sería activada en una actualización posterior.Al insertar mi sim y encender el equipo, me encuentro con la agradable sorpresa de que me recibe en idioma español para comenzar a configurarlo, lo que facilita mucho las cosas en comparación con las dificultades que había tenido antes en otros celulares de origen chino.Al tratarse de un OnePlus 8 Brillo Interestelar, tiene 12 GB de RAM y 256 GB de almacenamiento, así como una pantalla a 90 HZ, lo que aunado a una capa Android casi de fábrica, da como resultado un smartphone súper agil y potente. El sonido producido por su chip Dolby Atmos es excelente, aún cuando al igual que en otros smartphones de estos tiempos, ya no cuenta con un conector para audífonos, por lo que te verás precisado a usar auriculares inalámbricos. Las fotografías son buenas, pero nada espectaculares. Si el uso de fotos o videos de alta calidad te son relevantes, podrías considerar la edición Pro de OnePlus 8, o ver otras opciones.Un punto a destacar es que viene casi sin bloatware. La única aplicación preinstalada que no forma parte del ecosistema de Google o de OnePlus es Netflix, y no se puede desinstalar. Al menos en mi envío no viene con Alexa incorporada, pero si alguien la necesita bastaría descargarla del Play Store.Si a todo esto se añade que OnePlus garantiza 2 años de actualizaciones del sistema y 3 años en actualizaciones de seguridad, compras algo que realmente vale la pena.', 'This is my second Oneplus smartphone as I’m moving from the 6 to 8 and I’ve found a home with OnePlus. It may not have the name recognition in the USA that some of the other well-known brands do (Apple, Samsung, LG, Motorola, etc.) but now that more carriers are starting to adopt the brand in the states (Verizon & T-Mobile) it’s only a matter of time before it’s mentioned in the same breath as the Iphone or a galaxy. It has already topped many of the best phones of 2020 lists and for good reason. This phone is a beast, plain and simple. Whatever you throw at it, it can handle it plus more. Navigation in buttery smooth with a 90hz refresh rate screen. It’s got all the hardware you want under the hood with the latest Snapdragon processor on the market, 12GB of memory and 256GB of storage in the model I went with. It runs Android 10 with OxygenOS 10 UI which has always been good about giving the user great performance without shoving bloatware down your throat (it’s there but not in your face) They went away from the notch on the 6 and moved to a hole punch selfie camera on the 8 which really opens up the screen space.  The rear cameras are high-powered topping out at 48MP and takes superb pictures and videos. The 4300 mAh battery has already lasted me a complete day and some change including a twelve-hour shift at work as an IT professional when I’m constantly using my phone to perform tasks. The warp charger is insanely fast as I can go to empty to a full charge in about 45 minutes. What it lacks, I don’t miss. The headphone jack is no more from the 6 but most all phones have said goodbye to that relic from yesteryear. I don’t want to pay a premium for an IP68 rating (just get a SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle case and thank me later) nor do I care about wireless charging. If those things are important to you, pay the extra $100-200 and upgrade to the OnePlus 8 Pro. While the phone is 5g capable, unless you’re on T-Mobile, you will likely only see 4G LTE if you’re like me (AT&T) since the device is ahead of the carriers in terms of coverage and compatibility. The best Android experience around all at an affordable price point in the top tier of flagship devices. This is the smartphone you want. Don’t hesitate and purchase with supreme confidence.Pros• Smooth 90hz refresh rate• Snapdragon 865• 256GB of Storage and 12GB of memory• GSM Unlocked (AT&T, T-Mobile, etc)• Fast 30w WARP charging• 5G capable• Great picture quality• In screen fingerprint reader• Price is still exceptional compared to other flagship phones with similar specsCons• No IP68 dust/water resistant rating• Storage not expandable• No headphone jack• Lacks wireless charging• 5G currently only compatible on T-Mobile', ""I'll just begin by saying this is the best device on the planet. Obviously, it's bro is due very soon. However, it will remain at the top of any list this year and beyond. I do not purchase devices based on cameras or camera performance. So, my review pertains to its strength based on its purpose, and performance, as a phone. I understand that may not be a popular position, and it doesn't mean that I won't mention camera functionality. Here's my short. Its display is brilliant. Colors are excellently saturated, and it produces a three dimensional picture. Sometimes, I think it's more entertaining watching videos, and movies, on my devices. I can't say that it's a result of its 120-hertz refresh rate. Honestly, many 60-hertz displays can easily challenge the 8 Pro. I believe that the One Plus engineers are invaluable in this industry. It does have a new motion processor that is fun to use. This is different from the refresh rate. I appreciate it, and I'm not aware of any other phone that exists with that technology. I may be wrong. A few apps support this processing, such as Netflix, Prime and YouTube. It definitely sets itself apart from other devices on the market. Dolby Atmos audio speaker performance is great. I wish that manufacturers would revert back to front firing speakers. Thinking about those Pixel 2XL days. However, stereo separation is great from it's ear and downfiring speakers. Phone performance is great. I have no issues with calls or its 5G performance. I have to say that their Oxygen OS software is a step above stock Droid. Its Snapdragon chip is very good. Gaming is also good with very little video or audio lag. I Iike it's gaming processing. What I mean is it shuts down many other functions while it processes your choice of games. At times, it may get warm when gaming or watching videos. As with any other device, you can take proper steps to allow to cool, or not.Camera and video performance are good to excellent for those of you that appreciate camera capabilities. In my opinion, there aren't many devices on the market that are bad camera performers. Unless, you're a cameraphile, the average consumer will be just fine. If you've never owned a One Plus device, you will be pleasantly surprised with their performance. It's been fun. I highly recommend this device."", ""This is my first Oneplus phone, I opted for the non-pro version because of the slightly smaller screen, and the fact that the hardware specs I care about were identical on both (90hz is more than enough for me, and going from 60hz to 90hz is much more important than 90hz to 120hz). It's definitely fast and powerful, and in terms of running apps smoothy, is as good as any flagship Samsung or iPhone right now.The main con for me is that there's no external storage options, which is the one thing I miss the most from the S10e I replaced this with. The 256GB version certainly comes with enough storage, but I definitely miss the convenience of being able to pop the card out from one phone and put it in the other and keep all my music and pictures on it without having to sync to anything.My other main issue has to do with the OS. There's a volume slider on the side, which is fine, but you can't actually put the phone on vibrate or silent in the software itself, which really sucks since most of the cases for this phone so far require you to dig your finger in there and basically claw at your phone to silence it.My other gripes are more with the industry as a whole right now which this phone copied, so they are problems with pretty much any good phone right now. Curved screens might look cool but they are actually a spectacular pain to use, especially if you are using apps that require touches at the very edges of the screen, not to mention putting screen protectors on them is also a huge pain. Also I'm a guy with big hands and I can barely use this thing one handed, most apps don't even support the ridiculously long 6.5 inch screen anyway, so it's not like things even look better on it. This might be mitigated if the OS offered a good one handed mode options, but you are stuck with whatever is on the play store if you want to attempt that with this OS.I like the phone enough that I'll definitely consider Oneplus phones in another couple of years when I might upgrade again though (I like it overall better than Samsung that I have my own gripes with), I just hope OP offers a version with a smaller, flat screen, and adds external storage options, and it would be almost a completely perfect phone."", ""I was in the market for a new phone as my OnePlus 6T was on its last leg, charging port no longer working, and the battery wasn't lasting as long as it use to.So far this phone has been great. It charges fast with my old OnePlus 30w Brick, the camera is great, storage is fantastic, wireless charging is awesome and I dont have to worry about wearing out the usb C port as fast. The menus, user interface, and overall build of the phone seem to be very solid so far.I havent experienced any of the green tint issues that were happening with this phone for other users last year and hoping that doesnt pop up at some point.My two gripes at the moment are cell signal and bluetooth. I work in a building with a metal roof pretty far from a cell tower but with my OnePLus 6T I never had less than 4 bars, calls were clear, and I never missed a call, text, etc.Since switching to the OnePlus 8 Pro my cell signal is significantly worse. No one can hear me while I'm inside the building anymore, sometimes I even wont receive calls until the last ring and by then the caller hangs up. I am using the same sim card as I was before on the same network as before. My APN is set correctly so it's definitely a phone issue.Bluetooth: While music will play through the car, earbuds, speakers no problem and at a decently loud volume, bluetooth calls however are terribly quiet. I never had any of these issues with my OnePlus 6T but in my vehicle I have to turn my phone and vehicles volumes to max to even barely hear the person on the other end, same with my bluetooth ear piece. Again music plays fine, audio calls do not. I have not found any changeable settings that allow me to correct his and it still is an issue at the moment. I have yet to find a third party app to bypass the bluetooth volume limit when on a call."", 'Pro:Price good deal for the spec.Fast processor, sharp amoled screen.Fingerprint is good.Oxygen OS is like stock android, pretty easy to use.Camera software is good, like how it handle light source.Dual sims, unlocked, compatible with AT&T, Tmobile and Verizon (yes IMEI checked out with verizon)Fast charging, yes faster than Iphone 13. It has smart charge software control, can prolong charging for less heat. Battery life is good.Con: Some cons are subjective as compared to my previous phone (Huawei Mate 20)Fingerprint is on screen, less sensitive than my old phone which had dedicated finger print sensor behind the phone.Battery life seems less than my old phone, this is strange since Oneplus 8 has high endurance rating than the Mate 20. Could also due to Kirin chipset throttling better at power management.Oxygen OS has some quirks, just need to play with the settings e.g. default messaging app has MMS turned off for group texting. It would send individual sms to each recipient by default, or no way to close default music app locked in top notification bar without force stop.Heat dissipation/distribution: During initial setup, notice Oneplus 8 heat felt in one region of the phone. My old phone distribute and dissipate heat better. This is only a concern under intense usage, no heat issue during normal usage.No 3.5mm jack.No memory card slot.Speaker: playing music has tiny distortion from the vibration of the back plate. This effect is little, only affects certain type of music.Overall is good deal for the price.', ""I've been a Pixel person for many years now, but didn't have many options for an unlocked phone with near stockish Android and decent battery life.I will start by saying the phone doesn't have Alexa installed and it isn't required. Anyone giving it a poor review for that is misinformed.This phone seemed to be a better fit than a newer Pixel, but I was concerned with camera quality. The photos I've taken look really great and the camera app is very similar to the others I've used. I've taken several hundred pics since owning the phone and they have turned out almost as good (in some cases even better) than the ones taken with my Pixel 2 XL.I've installed all of my apps and been using it heavily and it gets significantly better battery life than my other phones. This was a big complaint and one of my primary reasons to upgrade. The screen on the 8 is really bright in Auto and adjusts well to surrounding light. Leaving the phone to adjust automatically has been fine most of the time and I rarely change it myself.The Warp Charging is absolutely amazing. Plugging it in for a short amount of time charges the battery up enough to use for hours. This wasn't really a huge selling point for me, but it did make me quite happy when I used it.The build quality and looks are impressive too. It just feels like a premium phone. The Interstellar Glow is an interesting color choice and it looks sogood in person. Any clear case will show off it's iridescent shine.Software has been a big win here. The simplicity of stock Android has always been appealing to me and getting away from that has been hard. You don't realize how much you were missing until you start using something like Oxygen OS on a OnePlus phone. You can change the icons on the entire phone with icon packs downloaded from Play Store. You can change the status bar, system icons, the color and shapes. So many things can be customized and it is so smooth.I was worried that I would spend the money to be let down, but this has been a great purchase. I'm happy with it and can't say enough good things about my new phone."", 'God']"

I am not fond of photography, neither of heavy gaming. But I do require heavy multitasking, good network, seamless performance in day to day basis, good battery and clean OS. But this phone has all of them. More than what you will ask. It houses the same modem that OP8/OP8 pro has, same camera Hardware as OP8, Almost similar OS. Special mention for network and data speeds. It has LTE Advanced with several additional capacities and absolutely flawless network.Screen on Time (4-5 hrs) Consistent and Charging is flawless. Battery drain is more during Hotspot or Mobile data.Charger doesn\'t heat the phone. but Processing doesBut only drawback is Snapdragon 765. It is by far highly weak for all of these.  It cant handle it for long and heats up too much. Even knowing this, the manufacturer has adopted different cooling systems like copper heat desiccator, on CPU, camera even at screen but of no help.I experienced heavy temperature up to  42-43 degrees on normal  usage and 45+ on 10 min video. Gaming also heats up equally. Even OP  customer care agrees 45 degrees damages CPU..Story of return... Something you should be aware ofI dint order return till 7th day. in all these 7 days I contacted Amazon CC and Oneplus CC. Followed their suggestions,  Wiping out Cache, Testing in Safe Mode, Factory Reset, etc. Followed min 20-max 80 % theory of battery chargingOn 7th day when I ordered return, I understood few conditions of 7 days return warranty. It saysItem received is physically damaged; (you should report in first 48 hrs)Item received has missing parts or accessories;Item received is different from their description on the product detail page on Amazon.in; orItem received is defective/does not work properly.Now its the last case for mine, but its highly subjective. Who will determine thisAmazon has a technician who will visit and inspect.Who are they, they are third party engaged by Amazon.the First visit fellow, from (TROUBLE SHOOTING).This fellow calls me at 11th hour (half hour before service needs to be completed as per schedule).He says he will come in few minutes and ask me some details.after few hours, i find My service is completed.What is the report?  my phone is working fine and no issues,That should make it non eligible for return.That is where Amazon comes to rescue. They listened to my issue and Arranged another senior technician.Also share that the only technicians report is not everything. By the time I already have temperature screen shots. I shared these with the second technician and he agrees to ""Item received is defective/does not work properly."".Thankfully my phone  return in picked up and money credited back. Thanks to amazon.and I ordered my other phone (off course not NORD) from amazon (!).So these are few words of caution.', 'Fast.. good display.. good camera for this price. Good job OP', ""Overall: 1. Solid phone. great camera2. Buy if you want 5G and have budget for 25-30k. Else you can go for realme/oppo at 10k lower cost.3. Much much better OS than xiomi/redmi. No bloatware. even oneplus app come default disabled!4. I loved the cameras even though online people have said camera is not so good. But again it's hit and miss. Some of the night pics (or those with light in background) i took seemed over-processed and/or pixelated. In such cases change the settings5. Sturidiness is good. But still buy with insurance. Screens once gone never come back!---5G: This is really something I don't think i'll need. i'm happy with 4G for all my needs. This shifting of spectrum is a total money making business. The shift from 3G-4G was necessary, but put unnecessary pressure on telecom players who had invested lakhs of crores on 3G spectrum for 20-30 year leases. That time reliance was the only early one to buy 4G spectrum at deep discounts (probably knowing before-hand about regime change). Again, I think 5G is a scam to help reliance make money (and 4G spectrum buyers like airtel lose money). I dont see myself needing 5G anytime in near future.Safety: I've broken my oppo 3 months back. Used an older Redmi. Which broke in one fall in 2 months. Used a broken phone for 2 months so this was important to me. This comes with plastic guard and screenguard inbuilt. Plastic guard is larger at corners.Weight: It seems sturdy enough. But lots of online reviews say the phone if mishandled can breakBatteries: Great fast charging! I charge once a day and charge for 30 minutes or so. even a five minute charge lasts for 2-3 hours (of video calling)Speed: I'm not a gamer or anything, but seems fast enough easily for all my needs.Close to Stock Android: I used to go for xiaomi and realme which completely spoil the android experience with their own versions. Might I say the xiaomi version was pure evil. It used to hoist a much of MI apps on me. If i uninstall MI Pay, the next morning, it used to come back, on it's own! Oxygen is such a relief after these. The OS -Muhc Much better than Xiaomi. Marginally better than Oppo and Realme.Build: I liked the build. It comes with its own cover. The cover has extra protection at the corners and has special seal for battery area so water doesn't get in.Camera: Comes with lots of cameras. How do these help? They give  the software a chance to build a composite image, capture more light in a shorter interval and get depth perception easier.Close up camera: I have captured a baby butterfly/moth which was smaller than a fingernail. This was at full zoom. Though i was only holding with hand, there is no blurriness on image. Details have come out adequately. Supposedly i could have done a macro but the camera interface doesn't easily open up all the features. For example I had to fiddle around before i could figure out how to switch on the flash.Nightvision Camera: 3 exhibits for your viewing pleassure. I have done a comparison between the actual photos in the night, and the modified photos as captured by the cameras. As you can see, the captures have completely improved the lighting. I have not captured using tripod for long exposure etc and yet shakiness is not too high. The starkest effect is in the selfie captured where it seems like day! the colors in the modified image are true to actuals. This was very surprising to me!Selfies: Good camera as gets nice depth. Use with google photos to ensure you never run out of space for photos!Color: Blue is my favorite color, and I love the pastel blue of this phone."", ""So i was really excited for my first one plus phone but only thing special about it is oxygen os everything else is just ordinary.CamerasMain camra and ultra wide cameras are really good. Although I am not able to see difference between 12 mp and 48 mp photosPortrait mode photos are below average. Very poor edge detection. My old phone with single camera detecte edge better that this one. 90% times i didn't get a good photo with nord. 1 photo attachedMacro camra is just there its of no use. Personally i think i will never use it but even if anyone want to use it its of no use it captures blurry photos all the time.Selfie cameras are very good they don't beautiful you and capture great photos. Both look really good in good lighting conditions but in low light ulrra wide capture little darker imagesTime lapse is good slow mo is average and night mode also goodOsOxygen os is excellent with some unique and cool features like changing accent color. Only one problem i feel is that it uses lock screen password for app lock which iam not a big fan of.Blotware pre-installed. The one you can uninstall are Facebook, Insta, amazon and some one plus apps. That you can not uninstall are Netflix, YouTube music.BatteryBattery on nord disappoints me the most. I use 90hz refresh rate. Its get me total stand by time of 12 to 13 h With screen on time of about 6h. That mean if i charge phone in the morning i have to charge it by end of the day again and i don't even play games (screen shot attached).Charging is great it charges 0 to 100 in about an hour if not using it. And around 1h 15 min if i use it during charge.DisplayIt look beautiful. And with 90hz its its really fast on scrolling through insta. And i don't have any tint issue with it. I am glad i didn't choose another lcd panel phoneOther thingNo notification led is really a pain. Hope one plus provide always on display soonNo headphone jackFingerprint and face unlock is fast and reliable didn't face any single issue with them till now.Speakers are loud and clear. Not to loud but i can say it's above average.Haptic  is cool.Design feels good and premium. And the form factor is just perfect.Google phone really suck. I cant record call without informing other person in the call. It give a loud warning when starting call record that other person can also hear.Phone runs smooth no issues with the performanceso the only disappointed for me is battery life and portate mode shots. I hope it get fixed with ota as promised by one plus on forum"", ""Yup, the title is completely correct.  I never write reviews because it just isn't my thing. Let me tell you the REAL TRUTH !For the price this phone serves the purpose, well actually serves the purpose real good.First of all camera is great, for those saying its really bad and didn't expect this, you guys should've seen the camera in 6t and 7 when it was launched and those were real flagships not some midrange phones. Personally i've installed gcam in my phone and my mind was personally blown away with the difference a mere software can make with the images. So point 1 install gcam.Point 2, phone definitely doesn't feel cheap or less durable in any way. Glass back is good, and it even has nfc which i personally love. Small things like alert slider add to the experience. And oxymorons comparing it to pixel 4a tend to forget that it also has plastic body. Personally i'd consider a phone with decent hardware and fabulous ui better than vivo or oppo with metal frame and glass back with ads popping in your homescreen.Point  3,the battery is also good.  I mean its not exceptional or anything.  I'd be lying if i say that it will last you an entire day with heavy usage. Iphone users won't complain about the battery if you know what i mean. I've been using my phone at 90hz and it is giving me 6 hours approx screen on time and this is not bad. Plus the charging is really good, inbox 30 watt charging can easily give you 0-50 percent in 20 minutes.And lastly my dear gamers, this phone IS CAPABLE OF GAMING.  For all those saying this can't be used for gaming never did the real tests. Most of pubg players would rather play at smooth 60 fps than hdr with shadows on. And i played 90 fps and never felt any lag personally. After a god 40 minutes or so cpu starts to throttle a little bit but that's expected because this is not sd 855 or 865. But you definitely can game, it's not a dealbreaker. Other games such as asphalt or cod run well. Only drawback i can mention here is lack of headphone jack which would've been handy.All in all a good phone, those experiencing bugs or software issues don't worry oneplus has already addressed the issues and are working on a software patch to fix this already. Oneplus is not a brand that will ditch its customer ever. So chill guys! this is a decent device and you can buy this without any worries. Hope this cleared your issues"", 'Nice', ""The phone is awesome. First lemme clarify some of the doubts. My mobile is packed on 7 January 2021 and I ordered it on 20 Jan. So very recent product. Kudos to amazon for that. And in the product I didn't find any display tint. But lemme tell you that if you have used lcd panel phones for long you'll find that this mobile has warm whites. I customised it and set it to cool level but still it felt slightly yellowish than my other phones. After lots of research I found that it's the feature of amoled screen. The whites in amoled screens are not very bright and clean. So don't worry about it just set it to cool. Then coming to ui, it's awesome. Very clean and smooth ui. It has all the customisation you need but doesn't feel heavy like miui. Then camera. Camera is very good. Now if you compare it to mi 10i it's not that good but it's not far behind. If you have tight budget and want good camera you can go for mi 10i. But if budget is not a concern and you want overall best phone then this is the one. Also if you consume media a lot you'll find this display far better than mi 10i. I gave 4 stars to battery as it could have been better. It's not disappointing but it could be improved. I always keep my mobile at 90hz and it is giving me around 6 and a half hours of screen time with online classes with 20-25% left😬. Also the mobile is quite compact amd not heavy like mi 10i. It feels good in hand and in terms of selfie its better than 10i. Games are smooth and there's no lag. Overall it's the midrange King. I don't know in which bands 5G will be launched in India. It has only N78 I guess so if it's launched in some other band it'll not support. 10i has two bands n77 and 78. If you wanna be sure that your phone is supported then buy moto g 5G as it supports all the bands🙂Update- March 25About a week back I received oxygen os 11 update amd now the battery backup is really great. I've watched movies and chatted and done normal web surfing and the screen on has been 6 hrs and 12 mins and still there's 50% left which is awesome for a 4115mah battery phone. You can say I can notice about 20% increased battery life. And in this update OnePlus has also enabled always on display and it looks so great"", ""I purchased Nord in prelaunch. I researched in my price band <40k, and this phone seemed like the best option.Let me go through multiple factors about the phone, I personally like to find cons in the phone to make sure I don't blindly recommend it -1) screen -It's great, you can easily compare it with sub 20k phone. you can consider it great 8/10 .People complaining about tint issue, well its there but u need very keen eye to notice in pure dark background(room) and phone screen should have grey filled (like chrome incognito). But trust me, nobody stays on grey screen doing nothing while they experience tint2) Size, design- Again, phone is durable. I dropped it couple of times, oneplus themselves shown stress test. The plastic build is not an issue as pre 2018 phones were all plastic. Size i think its more of elongated , slightly larger in hands, ideally should be around 6 inch. (8/10)3) Battery, charging - Well battery is 4115mah, and its good . How did I measure? i have accubattery app which measures overall %/hr and amount per app , gives me complete statistics. I compared with old onplus and nokia i think the avg unload is 9.8%/hr which is lower than rest smartphones. Total time is unmeasurable because its heavily varied acc to usage. Charging of this phone is insane, goes near 60%/0.5hr with app temp of 36-38.5 degree. Considered as industry best. Insanely fast patches and guaranteed 3yrs update. 9.5/104) Software - One word -Sleek and insanely fast. No bloatware at all. (10/10)5) Performance - The performance is not comparable to >845 chipset. So do not compare. Daily you won't even notice , exact same app times and same sleep performance unless measured side by side. 8/106) Camera- Here I think It lacks quite a bit in terms of below pointsa) Low light ultra wideb) Overall macroc) Useless depth camerad) Poor detail n ultra wide selfieComing up to main camera it's great, now great is only measurable if u compare it with apple or pixel right? not exactly, those phones are camera centric while this is overall balanced phone.Trick - Use google camera app and you will feel upgraded to a pixel in most situations. Yes most. (7/10 thks to google camera app)6) Bugs - There are occasional bugs, but they do provide quick updates so ,.. (7/10).People complaining about the phone being bad, is it unusable? Think about it . My dad uses redmi 4, which is slow, horrible bugs , ads etc. which is truly unusable"", ""This might help someone and save their money.1. Don't decide to buy a phone on crapy paid YouTube reviews (think if they are given review unit, those will be absolutely well quality checked and enhanced ones, no company give crapy defective product to review and take down their own reputation) only who spent money and bought to review them they review that product genuinely.2. Don't fall for so called company logo or crappy watermarks on pictures they captured ( which seems cool as every owner thinks, which actually not), they aren't worth your money.3. Don't rush and take newly launched phones, always see user reviews and buy.4. BEWARE OF FANBOYS. yes, this is important. As many of my friends have this company product, they feel themselves as brand ambassadors, they think their mobile company is superior supreme.. just because they have spent more money for after all a Chinese product, now because crapy Chinese product. Don't listen to those Fanboys, after all they are not your pocket but you are going to spend for it. Choose what makes you happy, even 10k mobiles aren't bad. You decide your mobile product not those product advertising people in your friend group.Now I tell my review about the unit I got:Pros:1. Slim sleek design2. Good OS3. Wide diplay4. Charging speed, charged to 100% within 40 min5. Handy6. Haptic touch is very responsive7. Good back cover8. No lagsCons:1. Camera:Camera is not at all feels like OnePlus camera (as I used many OnePlus phone's pictures of my friends). Though it has same camera specs of 7t and 8,8 pro (main camera I am referring to) it doesn't click photos like them. I feel my iPhone SE (2016 model) takes better natural pictures than this. Poor low light pictures, grainy, and photos become filter applied at 2x at low light. Depth sensor won't detect edges properly. Marco is waste, main camera colours are over contrasted. Front camera takes beautified pics even we don't use any filters, not at all natural pics, my iPhone SE old model's 1.3 mp takes more natural skin tones than this camera, it's like oppo beautified camera, wide angle camera is good.2. Display:Pink tint issue was present. More visible in Google apps. There was black bar visible extending from front camera notch hole, which was so irritating. It was visible in dark room, in dark theme, brightness below 10 percent.In light theme I could see screen fluctuations even though auto brightness is off.90hz is just a gimmick, battery drains fast at 90hz. So when I changed it to 60hz to save some battery, it is so yuck, lags are more, works like 2gb ram android phone. Since I came from using my iPhone SE old model at 60hz which is way butter smooth even after using it for 3.5 years, this nord disappointed me.3. Build quality:I got unit which had minor dent at its right corner.4. OSGood. Found some bugs like revert of settings to default after theme is changed. So u need to change those every time u change the theme, so irritating.Final opinion:I returned this product, Amazon service was great. 28k is not worthy for average processor, bad camera, average os, average build quality, average infact bad display. If you buy this thinking camera is good , you are fooled. Instead take 7t or realme x2 pro or k20 pro or Samsung m51 or a51, they won't disappoint you. Think wisely, don't fall for false useless advertisement gimmicks.Hope this helps you. Thank you, have a great day.""]"

This is a completely user review. So I have been using this phone for a week now, and here are my observations:1. An extremely well-built, solid hardware-software, very refined and polished. You will like every moment of using it.2. The display is awesome, almost at par with Samsung\'s super-amoled displays. Videos in Youtube, Netflix, etc. are super clear, have high contrast and colours, and super quality.3. A 3.5mm jack is sorely missed. You ned to buy a separate type C to 3.5mm for the headphone. You need to click the mic button for the mic to work. The mic also doesn\'t work with many earphones, and those without the button may not work at all. But the phone\'s built-in mic will be used and the sound output is via the earphone. I need to research more into this. Bluetooth headphones work great though. I am using a cheap Rs.100 converter, and the sound output through my Sony/AKH/Boat earphones are mindblowing. No loss in sound quality. Very high bass. It becomes higher when you turn on ""Bass bosst"" in the equaliser settings.4. Sound output through the speakers is awesome too. It does not produce the tin-can sound that most phones produce. The sound output is really good even for small things like notification alert and ringtones, and whatsapp messages.5. The camera is absolutely fantastic. It produces crisp, real colour images with high detail in both front and rear cameras. I am a very long time user of Samsung flagship phones, and the only good cameras are above Rs.60k phones. But still they produce unrealistic high contrast software boosted images that look great, but not realistic. The Nord\'s camera is the best I have seen in any phone, even better than Iphones.6. The battery is incredible too. Again coming from Samsung flagships, I never remembered the time I actually charged the phones more than 20 minutes, and had more than a day\'s worth of power. The Nord is better than that. I charge my phone to 75% in the morning, and then connect to laptop (wifi hotspot) for around 8 hours, listen to music, watch videos, an hour of calls, and continuous whatsapp Skype use, and the battery still shows 30-35% next morning.7. Following the above point, yes I have a couple of habits, and always use dark themes, kill all apps every single time before locking my phone, have turned off all notificaions from most apps except whatsapp, Skype, Zoom, messages, etc. Have also denied permission of location, etc for all apps until I actually use them and need location access. Bluetooth, wifi, NFC, tap to wake, lift to wake etc are always off. I don\'t need them and it\'s disturbing to receive nonsense notifications. I am a hardcore PC gamer, and do not like to play games on the phone. I had always got mindblowing battery backups from my previous Samsung devices, and the Nord\'s backup beat every one of them.8. That slider on the Nord is a magic wand. With my previous phones, I had to unlock, and then change profiles to ring, vibrate and silence. The Nord has a 3-point slider (yes, it is 3-point, and it took me a while to realise this as I thought it was 2-point at first). You can switch between ring, vibrate and silent just by the slider.9. There are options to set the display area to just below the front camera holes so they are not intrusive on the videos is awesome.10. There is also an option of ""greyscale"" that turns the display, and everything you see, to black and white, and this is system wide, and also turns the video playback to black and white, which I think is pretty awesome too.This part of the review is biased: My previous 3 phones have all been Samsung flagship devices, Note 4, A8, and then Note 8. They are absolutely brilliant devices, and I need to write a comparison for people who are thinking of switching.1. The camera on the Nord beats all of them is quality and real colour reproduction. The Nord\'s front camera is better than all the Samsung device front cameras combined. Those were absolute garbage, a little better than VGA level cameras.2. Samung devices always have bad music quality, even with the dolby atmos turned on, and volume turned to max level. The Nord\'s music quality is far far superior, even without touching the equalizer, and the volume halfway up.3. I never felt the need to use an S-Pen much on the Notes, and the thousands of software customisationsly  that Samsung offers. They are mostly a gimmick and you wouldn\'t use them past the first 1-2 weeks of purchase. These features are not missed.4. Now, the Samsung flagship Super Amoled displays are better than Nord\'s Amoled display. The whites on a Samsung are milky bright white, and the blacks are absolute deep blacks. This was system wide. The Nord\'s blacks are greyish blacks, and the whites are greyish too. The reds on a super amoled is blood red, and the Nord\'s reds are crimson yellow-ish. Similar with the blue colour. If you are coming from an LCD or OLED display you won\'t notice any difference, but if you are coming from a Retine HD, or Super amoled 1080p/1444p 400 ppi plus display, you are going to notice it for a very long time.5. Samsung\'s built-in theme store is very sorely missed. It was very exciting to change themes every 3-4 days, an have a complete system-wide new look. Oneplus\'s software does not have themes. Third party launchers and theme apps, even paid ones will only let you customise the lock screen, home screen, and the menu icons. Everything else will still look the same. Also, the lock screen and home screen have nice contrast if you set an HD wallpaper. The rest of the system has a grey-ish black background if you set the ""dark"" theme, and greyish white with the default theme.6. I personally was a big fan of the old 3x4 keyboard layout that Samsung has built-in. I am now trying to get used to the qwerty srtyle keyboard. Third party keyboards are not as smooth as the default ones. Although Nord\'s keyboard has a cool feature of setting custom background images on the keyboard.7. I do miss the 3.5mm jack. I could connect the desktop to usb tethering, or charging, and still listen to songs while I work. This is no more possible with the Nord. Some third party converters have a type c and 3.5mm jack split 2-in-1, but it can only be used to slow charge the device and listen to music at the same time, and not data transfer or usb tethering. This was important to me.Finally about my decision to buy the Nord: So obviously I wanted to upgrade to a Samsung flagship S-series or Note series device. But the choices were all above Rs.40k. That too after applying exchange value and discounts. The Lite series for the note and S series Samsung phones are all renamed lower-end phones and have horrible cameras, and other half-baked features. I also looked at LG\'s G8X, and they were selling at largely different rates at different websites, and it was untrust-worthy. Moreover, all of the flagship phones are at 6.5 inch display sizes, or larger. I hate large displays that I couldn\'t operate with one hand, and are not just practical for a primary device. I feel a  5.5 inch device is the perfect size. The Nord is bigger than that, but fit in one hand well. All the other features fit the bill perfectly. I was not ready to shell out Rs.40k and above for a phone I wouldn\'t use to it\'s 100% design and hardware capacity and intent, and I was getting the Nord at Rs.20k after exchange of my old phone.I am very happy with my purchase, and it was very much well worth it. I have played around with the phone, tweaked a lot features, and found the complete package far better than flagship devices from other brands. I bought another 2 Nords for family members, and they are happy with the devices too.', 'I\'ve been using my OnePlus 3T for almost 3 years now and I still didn\'t feel the need to upgrade from there since my screen of that phone is gone. Being an OnePlus fan I was eyeing for 7T. But I couldn\'t justify the price for that according to my day to day needs.So not being a hard-core user of mobiles I started looking for other options which will fulfill my usage without spending extra bucks. And the day 1+ announced the Nord i knew this will be my next mobile. It\'s a fantastic daily driver with decent camera quality (unless you\'re a mobile photographer please wait for the Pixel 4a)Now coming to my pros and cons-Pros:1. Battery life is excellent. Getting almost more than a day with 100% charge.2. Display is fluid and ""big"" (do keep in mind I was using 3T for 3 years now so screen is a big improvement for me. May not be valid for the ones who has used 5T or 6T in recent times)3. Still love the Oxygen OS with the add-on features4. Bluetooth connectivity is fast. I\'m using OnePlus Wireless Z earphones which connects to Nord quite fast compare to my 3T5. Design is good though I still love my Gunmetal design of 3T. Don\'t think any other latest 1+ phones can beat that design (just my perspective)6. Signal strength is good too. Don\'t have any problems with my cellular calls.7. 128GB storage is plus.8. Already received 2 updates within a week.Now coming to the cons -1. Camera set-up. I really don\'t like the design of ""Quad-camera"" set-up at all. The kind of audience they are targeting with Nord i think it would be much more appreciated if they just give 2 camera selection with some good image processing software.2. Now talking about image processing unit, they could have done better. I mean night images are okay but it could have been good. If they followed the simpler approach like pixel 4A I don\'t think anyone would buy Pixel unless someone is Pixel fanboy.3. Next thing speaker. Again this is decent mono speaker but they could have added stereo one instead of macro and useless lens. People like us we don\'t do macro photography and never going to do it with a phone but we will definitely watch some videos and songs on our phone. But don\'t take me wrong because quality of the speaker is good but it lacks the base. Compared with my wife\'s 1+ 6T (yeah we got 3 OnePlus phones and one earphone in our house)Summing up, 1+ Nord is a good budget phone for those who are planning to use it on day to day basis. Good screen, good battery life, decent camera and speaker will definitely justify the price. Having said that it would have been a real ""budget killer"" if OnePlus opts for two camera set-up with better quality and stereo speakers. My take if someone is really into mobile photography then wait for Pixel and buy that without any second thought. But if you want a good phone and ready to compromise the camera quality then look no further. Hope this helps. Cheers', 'Oneplus Nord... I have been using this phone since 10 August 2020 and now it\'s a 15 days of usage review.This phone got a lot of hypes and I think it\'s all worth it... If someone planning to go from 15k phone user to under 30k segment this phone is a great one for you.1. So coming to the design aspect this phone is gorgeous, don\'t confuse yourself by the plastic frame and all use a bumper case.2. Battery life.. Is kind of decent and I won\'t say it\'s a great one I have been playing heavy games recently and I get roughly about 30 percent remaining battery life at the end of the day... So it\'s pretty decent.3. Camera, here it\'s the main feature where you can take great photos at the outer lighting conditions and in indoor it also take some pretty good photos not bad.. The macro camera the only disappointing factor other than that this one is great for taking good shots. And the front camera is great and the wide angle lens makes the best use from it. Video quality is great in both the front and back camera thanks to the optical image stabilization.4. Performance... The snapdragon 765G doing a decent job as it shows no lag in the loading of apps don\'t worry about the PUBG high graphic settings it really works great super smooth in its at most usable higher setting. If you are a heavy gamer then you should go for other Snapdragon processor which gives high graphic importance in the play.5. Display... The 6.44 inch super Amoled display looks good and yes in the outdoor just make sure you increase the brightness before you go out or else you can\'t what\'s in the screen. Since it\'s 6.44 pill shape punch hole design the phone doesn\'t look soo big and it\'s handy to use. Even in the 60 htz display it works soo smooth thanks to the Oxygen OS and in 90 htz it\'s even more smoother for browsing and scrolling news feeds in social media but it takes 2% of charge higher than usual.6. Fast charging... From 20 to 100 percent it takes around 1 hour to charge and its good job for its battery capacity.7. No headphone jack... It\'s the major disappointment in this phone but yeah you can use a type c to 3.5 audio jack dongle which cost you extra.And finally from the attached picture you can see in my phone there is ""no green tint"" issue in the oneplus nord, maybe some units got that issue and I hope they have replaced them... Overall Nord is a good phone from oneplus don\'t think about other negative points people tell if you are planning to buy just go for it. My 4 star for this phone is just because of the delivery delay for my pre booking and the worst packing... It got so many damages in my box. Thanks hope you guys find this review useful.', ""Okay. So, firstly, horrible delivery by Amazon india. I placed the order on 30th July. It got shipped on 12th August and was delivered by 16th. This review will be completely unbiased and will come from an user who used vivo v15 pro beforehand.Like all of you, I also believed that Nord did not live up to the hype by seeing it get criticised by reviewers. But, trust me, this midranger gives you the same premium feeling as you would expect in a flagship device. (Not joking, it's beautiful). Obviously if you come from a device like OnePlus 6,7,8 it's a downgrade, no doubt. I wanted to buy the 7t for it's features and processor, but I bought the Nord. Why ?1) 10k cheaper than 7t.2) Better selfie camera composition.3) Same bloatware free oxygenOS.4) 90Hz fluid AMOLED display. (trust me guys, it's buttery smooth. I found it brighter than my vivo and way smoother due to the 90Hz panel. You will get addicted to the display).5) sd 765g : Day to day tasks like swiping , moving through apps is as fluid as found on higher premium OnePlus devices. (I compared the swiping speeds with 7t pro, it could catch up with the 7t pro). I'm not a heavy gamer. I usually keep my gaming sessions short like for 10 mins at a stretch and I'm done. I noticed zero frame drops playing COD, it ran very smooth. No lags.5) Build quality : I don't know why so much people are making a fuss over the plastic frame. I used an unibody cheap plastic built v15 pro and coming from that, the NORD felt VERY premium in my hands. It is really compact, inhand feel is awesome. You can feel it's a premium device when you hold it. Stop believing crap like the phone feels less premium due to it's plastic frame. We wouldn't even know it was plastic unless it was clarified by OnePlus.6) User interface: Coming from a trash funtouchOS, the oxygenOS is heavenly. It runs apps very smoothly and really fast. No complaints.7) I don't know how many people would want to know but the ultrawide angle selfie cam is pretty useful. It helps.8) Super linear bottom firing mono speaker: The speaker has way more better clarity and loudness than my v15 pro. Yes, it's definitely not loud as the 7t /8/7t pro. But it's loud enough. Would not complain.Here's what I do miss tho:-1) I really miss the headphone jack. I don't have money to buy TWS rn. So I do, dearly miss the headphone jack.2) I expected ufs 3.0 storage. But 2.1 is okay, you wouldn't notice if you aren't that nitpicky.3) The camera quality I would say , for an all-arounder star device like the Nord, it's okayish. It gives you really good day light pictures with decent details. It won't disappoint you in any aspect if daylight pictures are concerned. The pictures look natural, not artificially boosted and punched like vivo phones. The ultra wide sensor gives you really good colors and you won't really find any difference until you zoom into that picture for details. I could get very good(if not the best) portrait shots and the macro camera, well it's useless. Don't use it. Overall, I know OnePlus will definitely improve the camera on this through regular software updates.4) unpopular opinion : Even if a premium phone with better cameras and a flagship processor comes out in the market, I would prefer oxygenOS rather than choosing any of the realme, miuis,etc ."", ""The build of the phone looks very premium, however, surprisingly it is very lightweight. It is way lighter as compared to my Redmi K20. Hence, the Redmi K20 feels a bit sturdy on my hand. That doesn't imply that the Nord is not well built but the on hand feeling is well a bit disappointing to me.The cameras are kind of okay. The main camera is the one that will give you impressive pictures. The macro is too weak. Personally I'd have preferred a telephoto. Again let me compare with the K20. The primary camera of Nord is way better. The OIS will help you click better shots with the camera. The nightscape is impressive (better than what Redmi offers). Now if you can find the right GCam for Nord, I guess photography will be sorted. The Ultrawide camera will give you mixed feelings. Even I can't decide if the K20 is better or the Nord.Battery wise it lasts a day for me with regular usage. That's pretty good. Charging speed is pretty exciting!The 90hz screen is a pleasant affair but I am yet to experience its impact other than while swiping and scrolling.The fingerprint reader is I guess the best in class. It's fast and accurate. I have come to love it. I always favored hardware fingerprint reader after my experience with the K20, but Nord has me loving it.One thing I love is the software. I am a fan now. I preferred stock android over any other skin. But, maybe it is Oxygen OS that deserves to be the best. This is quite stock-ish. I used an Android One phone and then switched to this, and I feel like at home. With some renovations here and there.The rest of the hardware will cover you for a complete experience. I guess a metal frame is what could have made it better. Jerry did Bend it like Beckham.So if you are looking for great cameras, don't buy this. Honestly, the Realme X series will fare you better or wait for the Pixel. If you are just a casual clicker then the primary camera won't disappoint and the Nord does tick all other boxes. I think the experience of Oxygen OS should make up for what it lacks. And it's a mid ranger so don't expect flagship quality. It is pretty well balanced."", ""The OnePlus Nord feels premium to touch and the weight is well-balanced. The handset is easy to grip and feels very compact to hold. Camera bump is huge, frame is plastic but doesn't feel like it.There’s no 3.5mm headphone jack so had to purchase a Bluetooth headset worth 2k.OnePlus retains the slider button however it's not being used as WFH.OnePlus seems to have made no compromise with the display, a 6.44-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels and pixel density of 408 ppi. There's a 90Hz refresh rate and the aspect ratio of 20:9 makes the 6.44-inch display easy to hold. Having said that, the device feels a bit longish and it will take some to get used to the form factor.It’s a delight to watch movies or stream content on the device. The colours are vivid but sunlight legibility is no good even with max brightness.The overall camera quality is pleasing but definitely not the best. This is because as long as you use the primary camera-- 48MP Sony IMX586-- the output is good. But the same cannot be said for the secondary sensors. The front camera produces good quality selfies.The fingerprint scanner is not the fastest in the business.About the performance, this device does well when it comes to gaming (CODm) and multitasking. While gaming, expect the device to get warm but it will not slow down the phone. Overall, the device manages to offer a smooth experience without any software hiccups or app crashes. For average users, who are into occasional gaming, the Nord will easily take care of all your performance demands.The WarpCharge 30T is a delight as you can get around 50% battery time by charging the battery for 25 minutes and reaches 100% within an hour for me. Battery lasts longer, refer the screenshots (taken over a month since I got the phone).The Nord is a fine overall package but do not expect it to be a replacement for a true flagship device which runs the latest Snapdragon 800 series processor. Having said that good battery life and the promise of timely software upgrade makes the Nord a compelling choice under Rs 30,000.I got it for 26.5k with HDFC discount on Prime Day sale and at this price it's a value for money purchase."", 'Pros-1.Great 90Hz Fluid Amoled Display with Good Colours But There is some Cons that will get updated in Cons.2.Performance Is Top Notched...the Main reason behind this Is Oxygen Os it is well optimised,Smooth and Bloatfree.3.Camera is Not that Bad It is above Average There is need to get improve in Ultrawide shoot and In indoor light and Object with black Colour As oneplus is improving with Software updates..Macro Camera Has been improved.4.Battery life Is Good As we know Higher refresh rate consumes Battery Faster But in case of Oneplus Nord the battery is well Optimised in 60hz also We are getting approximately the same battery life which we are getting in 90hz.Cons--1.Display has a green and pink tint at 0-40% of brightness. It is Visible In Greyish Colour skin And It is also Visible in Notification panel and when we dragging the Screen upward to unlock with pin and Also when we unlock The whatsapp with the default whatsapp finger scanner in that lockscreen also there is pinkish which is visible.Also The 90hz Display need to get some improvement as i am noticing some gitter sometimes so it need some more optimisation.2.In Camera Department All Cameras need improvement.A.In Main Camera When we click the pictures of black like things thr colours are not upto the mark and also In shadow areas it has become more dark which leads to loss out of details.In potrait pics In 1X The picture are Coming Very nice but when we Do 2x in potrait that time the Skin colour tone are Changing and There is colour shifting.B.In ultrawide Camera also the image Colours are dull and also Not Clear when we zoom in the clicked picturesC.Macro and Depth Sensor are Useless Only But still Oneplus is focusing to improving which is Good.D.In Pubg,The option Of extreme framerate is not available As the 765G is capable of It and oneplus Has promised it will get by Software updatesCONS--It is all round good phone for daily usage...And also Oneplus has promise to resolve the cons if it get resolved by updates then it will be One of the best phone in this price segment and as we know oneplus is top notched in providing updates...', ""I've been using this phone for 2 weeks nowPros1. 90Hz Amoled Display  -- This is the cheapest device in market with an amoled 90hz screen.2. Oxygen OS3. Oneplus BrandCons1. Selfie Camera even with 0 beautification punches out extremely soft pictures. They are so bad, you can't even use them to post on social media. Taking group selfies with this phone is an embarrassment, as photos are so bad, that someone else would usually volunteer to take the picture.I also installed bunch of other camera apps to remedy this failure including google camera but camera's hardware is in itself pathetic.My Poco F1 took much better pictures.My friends (including me) expects better pictures from a Oneplus Brand but these images just completely ruins the brand.2. Oxygen OS takes 20+ GB of storage.I wanted to get the 64GB model but considering this and how in future updates, OS size will likely grow, I had to shell out more for the 128GB model.3. Bad Market PracticesWhile every other brand is giving off amazing discounts, Oneplus didn't. Not only they didn't, they disabled the HDFC 10% discount for the 64GB variant of this device.NORD likely has much  better profit margins than a lot of phones in the market. We all know, it's not a value but excluding your device variant from discounts is just bad.NORD lineup doesn't make sense at this price point. Oneplus should've been selling their last year flagships near this price but instead they chose to release a worse product with likely better profit margins.4. Misleading Ads, HypeGoing to Oneplus NORD website, you'll see claims like flagship camera etc. Opening up the box, you'll get a paper listing out what makes a smartphone great and how it is not always about specs. All that marketing and yet the phone is extremely average.ConclusionOneplus NORD is a fine phone. It would've made sense to launch this in Western markets instead of in India. We have much better options under 20k which makes this phone extremely over-priced.This is coming from a person who is not price sensitive, I was actually looking to buy Oneplus 8T (awful colors though)  or Samsung S20+ (Amazing Discounts, this season). But since I don't play games, I thought I was taking a wise decision going with a company which knows it's not always about the specs. Oh boy, I was so wrong.In the end, Nord is an overpriced, very average phone with a great display and a respected brand ( for now atleast )"", ""This is a normal daily driver from oneplus. Not so good, not so bad.Pros:- Good design, feels premium even though the body is plastic- Good performance, no lag observed- Good call quality and music quality on headphones (compared to my oneplus 3)- Good signal reception and wifi speed.- Does not feel too heavy in hand and does not feel slippery with the case provided.- Smooth UICons: - Camera, this is is biggest negative of this mobile. I am not sure if it is the hardware or software, but it is bad. I feel my oneplus 3 produced better pictures with main camera. I do not see good colour reproduction, pictures appear little dull and low light picture is grainy. My family member's oneplus 6T is much better compred to nord's main camera. There is a huge huge difference in picture quality between 6T and this. I don't know what oneplus have done here. Selfie camera is also not good, oneplus 6T produces much better images. So if you are a photo freak, this is a big NO for you. Hope oneplus fixes it through software update. I am not much into photography with mobile, so I am fine here even though little disappointed.- Screen is not up to the mark. AMOLED with 90Hz disaply, really? Again I can compare it with oneplus 6T, and it looks better when playing games, videos or photos.- Battery drains faster without actually doing anythingOverall I do not feel this meets the standard set by oneplus, they have cut corners heavily, mainly camera and screen. This is just good enough as a daily driver, nothing great. I have gone for oneplus mainly for its support for good range of LTE frequency bands which can be used in countries like USA, compared to others in same price range. You will have better options for the price if your main concern is camera and you do not travel much to foreign countries.Update: After recent software update, camera is better and battery is not draining as before. Looks like it is improving. Giving 4 star."", '**This review is about Amazon Fulfillment and not about the Product or Seller. Will review Product after its use* *Amazon has breached its previous worst fulfillment record and added another worst delivery experience feather to its Tiara.Story goes like this...Amazon logistic shown product will be delivered in 5 days and on 5th day it changed its mind to be delivered after 10 days... Sigh!!! ok..waited for all these days and finally the day came...Day 1: 1st Attempt: Logistic guy after much of struggle reached my place and didn\'t deliver the Phone since he was unable to log IMEI number from my old phone (I have brought in exchange) to its system. Result: He proclaimed there is some logging issue and will come again tomorrow once the system is ""up"". I nodded. To my surprise what I see that he has cancelled the order with comment that customer had denied accepting the product.I connected with customer care and rectified that the product was wrongly setup as cancelled. They re-issued the ordered with an apology and assured me that the product will reach by next working day.Day 2: 2nd Attempt: I again got the message that the product is arriving today. I waited for my new phone with patience.. He came..given me my new phone...I quietly handed over my old phone to him.. but to my surprise..today..there was no exchange showing on my purchase.. He apologized and promised me to rectify the problem by next day and returned backDay 3: 3rd Attempt: As I was waiting for my new phone, I saw the ray of hope in shape of logistic person walking towards my house for the 3rd time with his bag..I asked him if all the applications on his system is working and showing proper information..He smiled & nodded..He handed me the phone with full confidence like he has won the battle of TROY but it all vanished like Helen of TROY when he tried to read the bar code from the product. It was gone as in all these attempts it was hardly visible. To show that he is fully committed to what he does, he tried different ways to read bar code but..all in vein as it didn’t worked out..He told me that he has to get it back to get the new bar code on the packaging.. I was speechless/surprised/gutted..Keeping the borrowed patience, I called Amazon customer care and tried to understand problem.. As usual, lot of apologies and no clue what so ever to be done, lady advised me to cancel the order and re order it..by this time my head was spinning on all direction to understand that, if, at first point delivery is so hard, how on earth if I re order an out of stock product, it will resolve my delivery problem..I took a glass of water.. sipped few drops and explained that rather than asking me to re order why don\'t she look how the same product can be delivered. She accepted the offer with a warning that if this time the product is not delivered then it will be returned to seller and I have to re order it..

Es cuestión de paciencia porque no funciona a la primera. Literalmente tuvimos que hacer el proceso 12 veces aprox y funcionó al final. Lo bueno es que Huawei no te invalida la garantía si algo pasara por eso. Todo este problema fue por el pleito de USA con la empresa. Entonces no tienen permitido venderlos con el servicio de GSM, lo dan con HSM, pero si lo instalas por tus medios esta bien.Fue una belleza encontrarlo porque es un excelente celular. Pero si hay que batallar un buen rato para lograrlo. Si te quieres arriesgar a hacerlo es un excelente celular, si la tecnologia no es lo tuyo, ni te metas._______________________________________No se pueden instalar los servicios de Google, no hay Playstore. Muchisimas aplicaciones no sirven. No hay solución, por más que uno intente instalarlas a través de terceros. Y en servicio al cliente de Huawei no pueden darte respuesta. Si tu trabajo, estudio o tus gustos, giran en torno a Gmail, Youtube, Meet, Classroom, Google, etc... No sirve este celular. HAY MUCHÍSIMAS APPS QUE NO FUNCIONAN, las del banco, no todas sirven, juegos que no se actualizaron por estar vinculados a la cuenta de gmail, perdiendo todo el progreso, se pierde el backup de Whatsapp, no se baja la última copia (adios chats importantes), gmail, youtube, solo se pueden consultar ""online"", por lo que no tienes la app que te notifique al recibir un correo nuevo y es lentísimo, ademas del consumo de datos que se eleva mucho. El vendedor no lo mencionó en su descripción y es un punto MUY IMPORTANTE a considerar. En proceso de devolución o reventa a alguien que aun sabiendo esto quiera el equipo.

Molte applicazioni non sono ancora disponibili ma sicuramente lo saranno presto.Per scaricare applicazioni ci sono molti store alternativi (trovapp, aptoide, apkpure, amazon app, petal search, appgallery).Se non ci fosse questa grossa lacuna dei servizi google, era un telefono da 5 stelle e anche di più.Vi consiglio di acquistarlo, anche perchè huawei sta lavorando molto velocemente per poter riportare più applicazioni possibili nei loro dispositivi."", 'Da lo que promete, aunque eso sí, si tienes mucha dependencia de los servicios Google este no es tu dispositivo ya que debido a la ""guerra"" de los dispositivos de Huawei con EEUU no les facilitan dichos servicios.El móvil es muy potente, pero tiene algunas limitaciones como es obvio ya que se trata de un dispositivo de gama media-baja. Los puntos fuertes sin duda son su cámara que es por este precio una auténtica maravilla y su fluidez, ya que no te deja colgado en ninguna aplicación.

Dicho esto, tampoco creo que sean opiniones justas, puesto que no están en realidad opinando sobre este terminal, sino sobre un terminal con servicios de Google, cosa que este no es. Es como opinar negativamente sobre un coche Renault porque no tiene motor Volkswagen.Dicho esto, este teléfono es una maravilla para lo que cuesta. Si tu deependencia de los servicios de Google es baja o salvable, como es mi caso, te llevas un terminal de gama media-alta con grandes prestaciones y muy buen rendimiento, a un precio imbatible. Solo echo un poco de menos el no poder tener dos tarjetas sim y tarjeta de memoria a la vez, aparte de que las tarjetas de memoria son NMCard, sistema propietario de Huawei, y no microSD.En cuanto a las cosas que no se pueden hacer, por no tener servicios de Google, pocas hay, salvo apps muy muy específicas o algunos juegos, pero incluso eso cambia día a día, gracias a que Huawei AppGallery incluye continuamente más y más apps que antes no soportaba. Cuando cogí este teléfono por primera vez, por ejemplo no estaba incluida la app C@lave PIN, que sirve para conectarse mediante certificado personal seguro a webs como la Agencia Tributaria y otras. Pues bien, menos de un mes después, dicha app pasó a estar disponible en AppGallery. Y si completas Appgallery con Petal Search, una app de Huawei que te ayuda as buscar apps disponibles, pero que aún no cuelgan directamente de AppGallery, como WhatsApp, ya puedes instalar prácticamente de todo.He léido y oído que no se puede pagar con el móvil, ya que no es compatible con Google Pay. Otra media verdad (y poca diferencia hay entre las medias verdades y las mentiras). Multitud de bancos tienen sus propias apps para pagar por NFC sin necesidad de usar Google Pay, y yo he sido capaz de pagar varias veces ya con apps como ING y Kutxabank. Se echan en falta las apps del BBVA, pero todo es cuestión de que dicho banco y Huawei colaboren hasta dar con la manera de hacerlas compatibles.A nivel de hardware da la talla de sobra. El Kirin 810 no es el procesador más potente de la gama media, pero está más que sobrado y supera a muchos otros. A nivel de cámaras, Huawei, como de costumbre, no defrauda, incluso en un teléfono con la etiqueta ""Lite"". Respecto de esto último, sí noto que las actualizaciones del sistema aparecen antes en sus hermanos mayores, sobre todo el P40 Pro y el Pro+. Aquí pequeño tirón de orejas para Huawei. Espero que mantengan la promesa de llegar a Android 11. Con un poco de suerte, incluso llegaremos al 12.Sé que hay mucha gente que se llevará las manos a la cabeza porque pensará que no va a poder acceder a cosas tan ""básicas"" como su correo de GMail, o que no va a poder tener almacenamiento en la nube, pero quiero terminar esta review desmintiendo algunas de estas cosas:- GMail: Es un servicio de correo, no solo una app. Con esto quiero decir que es posible acceder al correo de GMail, y gestionarlo, con el 99% de clientes de correo que hay para Android, muchos de los cuales están en AppGallery. Yo uso la app BlueMail y va perfecta- Almacenamiento en la nube: de serie, cuentas con 5Gb gratis en Huawei Cloud, además de ofertas para comprar más almacenamiento. Otros, como yo, usamos Onedrive. Aunque en mi caso, yo ya llevaba años con Onedrive, debido a que trabajo a diario con Microsoft Office.- Google Maps: curiosamente, funciona sin servicios de Google, al menos como GPS. No podrás iniciar sesión y guardar el historial de ubicaciones y otras cosas, pero mira, un punto para la privacidad. Si te gusta tanto tanto Google Maps, pero quieres seguir sin servicios de Google, prueba Here WeGo Maps, una alternativa magnífica y presente en AppGallery- WhatsApp: como ya he dicho, funciona. Lo único que no podrás usar será la copia de seguridad en Google Drive, pero desde hace un mes y pico, Huawei Cloud incluye un backup automático de WhatsApp. Aún está en fase beta, pero irá mejorando.En resumen, si te quieres adaptar y lo primero que buscas en un smartphone no es que tenga a toda costa los servicios de Google, este P40 Lite es perfecto, para llevarte un terminal potente y a un precio insuperable, Y encima te llevas la Huawei Band de regalo. Si es que al final vamos a tener que dar las gracuias a Trump y todo...Por cierto, viene con su cargador rápido (40W, de 0 a 100% en poco más de 1 hora), auriculares de 3,5"" (sí, tiene jack) y un protector de pantalla de hidrogel de gran calidad ya aplicado a la pantalla. Si quieres funda, deberás comprarla aparte.Adjunto una foto hecha hace unos días con el gran angular.', ""J'ai acheté le P40 Lite pour mon père qui car son ancien téléphone était malheureusement en fin de vie.Pour lui c'est le jour et la nuit en terme de performance et l'interface Android 10 avec la surcouche Huawei est plutôt agréable et ergonomique.Les plus:+ L’écran est très agréable et peut-être réglé contre la lumière bleue le soir avec le mode confort des yeux.+ Le processeur Kirin 810 + les 6Go RAM qui donne une rapidité et une fluidité d’exécution géniale et agréable au téléphone.+ Le téléphone tourne sur Android 10 qui est la dernière version sortie à l'heure actuelle.+ Les 128 Go de stockage qui laisse de la marge pour le stockage des photos, vidéo et autres fichiers.+ La batterie grande capacité de 4200 mAh qui charge rapidement avec la charge rapide et permet de largement tenir 1 journée en utilisation poussée (jeux, réseaux sociaux, vidéo...) et 2 voire 3 jours en utilisation simple ou restreinte.+ La reconnaissance faciale est plutôt réactive et marche plutôt bien.+ Les photos sont très belles avec les 4 capteurs à l'arrière et le travail de l'intelligence artificiel. *+ Le son est correct à mon gout.Les moins :- Le manque des services Google qui pour certains n'est pas un manque mais pour les utilisateurs lambda en devient un. En effet le Huawei store n'est pas très fourni en application et si l'on veux retrouver ses applications favorites (Facebook, Instagram, Maps, ou autres qui fonctionnent avec les services Google)  il faudra passer par quelques combines que tout le monde ne connaît pas forcément et ne sais pas forcément faire.- Le capteur d’empreinte sur le côté au niveau du bouton éteindre/allumé n'est pas pratique et devient inutilisable avec certaines coques de protection.- Les capteurs photo à l'arrière ressortent un peu et déséquilibre le smartphone lorsqu'on l'utilise posé sur une surface plate. Je pense qu'une protection est nécessaire si l'on veut éviter d'abimer la dalle des capteurs photo qui dépassent.Pour conclure je recommande ce smartphone si l'on sait bidouiller sur Android ou pour ceux qui veulent éviter l'utilisation des services de Google, sinon je préconise de prendre la version P30 qui est plus ancienne et qui fonctionne encore avec Google où une autre marque de smartphone car le Huawei store est assez vide pour le moment.

Come per Google, anche Huawei introduce app e servizi preconfezionati di default 8come predefiniti.

Di fatto devi scegliere se mettere sue sim oppure una sim e una nano micro ssd. Personalmente ho optato per la seconda scelta anche se 100 euro per una nano micro SSD da 256 GB (effettivi 216) siano davvero troppi.

I like that I can ask questions while the phone is on my desk or folded in my pocket and I'll get answers through the speaker or ear buds. I can make calls while it's folded and it will automatically go to speaker.

If I ever lost it I'd contemplate spanking myself. LOVE THE SIZE! When my old smart phone (OSP) stopped recognizing SIM cards, I purchased an unlocked flip phone (for under $40) to make calls and receive texts. The WiFi and apps on my OSP still worked, so I was carrying around 2 devices for several months. I LOVED the convenient size of that cheap flip phone. Thought long and hard about dropping that much cash on a smart flip phone, but I figured I could always take out a 2nd mortgage. Enough sarcasm about the cost. The Z Flip is a very slick design and has what I value the most - a compact size! Read all the reviews and compared with Motorola's offering prior to purchase. Feel I made the right decision. Only 2 negatives: (1) could NOT get the data transfer function (phone-to-phone) to work either via WiFi or cable. Tried several times - no joy. Since the Z Flip does NOT have an SD Card slot, I ended up transferring my photos from my OSP to my computer, then from my computer to the Z Flip. I had data other than photos on my OSP and had to find creative work-arounds, including typing in OSP data using the Z Flip keyboard, to get everything  on the Z Flip. After 6 plus hours, I'm up and running. (2) Samsung tries to push a bunch of unwanted functionality on you (in the form of Apps or Plug-ins).

This one is awesome and fits snuggly into your hand or pocket. I love the purply colour of it too. I put my current giffgaff nano sim straight in. It doesnt have a slot for a memory card. However,  with 8GB of RAM and 256GB internal storage,you can download more and capture plenty of videos or photos without worrying about running out of memory.

The phone performs great and the price and the plastic screen was the only complaint I had.EDIT: It's now been a little more than half a year with this phone and on the left side of the screen where the hinge is there is this black dot. I was really careful with this phone and I don't know how this happened.

This has been in it's limited capacity the most intuitive new phone set up I have ever done and I am a phone junkie. It's display is astonishing at price point. The fact that it has a devoted sd card is rare. It charged in less then an hour. It's FUN. The cameras are good. Parts are phenomenal. Low light macro ect. It's not a flagship but it performs somehow more intelligently and the security is comforting. There's a few caviots. It feels plasticky. And kinda hollow although heptatics are ok. It's sounds like a can and it does some volume anomalies when headphone jack is plugged in. Battery is brilliant and the whole thing Iis supremely customizable. It's a MASTER piece at under 300. It works flawlessly with T-Mobile for now anyways. It's worth every penny so long as it holds up. We shall see. Unfortunately after the storms in florida some charging issue arise which caused a battery issue which led to leaking and a circus to return. I really really liked this phone and I am certain that it was a lemon as opposed to a device specific concern. I will at some point try n luck again but had to make a quick replacement as to have serviceable set."", ""The case is a typical clear case, and it does come with a 64gb sd card, USB C cable/charger/adapter, sim card slot tool, and screen protector already on the phone screen.Everything is as the item listing details. Has facial recognition, on-screen fingerprint scanner, 1 sd card slot, 2 Sim card slots, very nice cameras, and everything else is as the hardware is listed. Comes with phone cloning instructions to port over all music/videos/pictures/apps/contacts/linked emails/almost everything from your old phone. Fingerprint and face scanner has yet to fail me once.Honestly a great price for how much usability this phone has. Great for gaming and has a game space feature to stop calls and notifs when in games. Doesn't heat up much. Battery chrges super fast, empty to full in less than a half hour. Screen is very tall, takes up nearly the entire phone dimension with no gray space.Significantly better all around compared to the google pixel 3a/3aXL that my family also owns, which many would say is the best phone for around $350.The software has all the features you'd need in a phone. Screen casting, NFC, bluetooth, do-not-disturb settings, kid settings, malware scanning, storage cleaning, a smart assistant, smart driving mode, night mode, dark mode, and plenty of inherent settings for all types of customizing.Would recommend for anyone wanting a quality android worth around $450 in usability (Cost of the Oneplus 7pro that has similar specs) for way cheaper."", 'Llegó antes de lo esperado, me encantó que sí cumplieron desde un principio con la memoria de 64 GB. Tenía duda sobre el tipo de cargador, pero me mandaron el americano así que no me tengo que preocupar por conseguir un adaptador.Hasta ahora el celular ha tenido dos actualizaciones, se escucha muy bien y me está siguiendo el ritmo con todas las aplicaciones pesadas que le instalo. El Color OS resultó ser de mi agrado, solo le veo el inconveniente de dos apps innecesarias que se instalaron en la segunda actualización pero es porque tengo otras alternativas, aunque con los 128 GB de memoria, no me afecta demasiado.El lector de huella es una maravilla, es más rápido que el de mi anterior celular. Me adapté tan rápido a sus características, hasta ahorita no me ha decepcionado ni la batería, la carga rápida, su rendimiento ni la cámara, espero que siga así.No solo es un celular con diseño bonito, realmente cumple con las exigencias que el usuario pueda tener para un gama media, y hasta da un poco más de lo que se espera.

No me gusta que no tiene indicacion luminosa de cuando te llegan o tienes mensajes. No me ha resultado practico que el lector de huella este en la parte frontal. Solo puedes registar una huella digital lo cual creo que no es tan practico, anque el facial cubre un poco el que no lo puedas desbloquear con otra mano.

Needed a much faster phone (had a samsung S7 previously). It is exactly what I wanted. However, I find the battery usage could be better. A full battery gives me a day and maybe a couple hours the next morning. The phone size is good. A bit big but seems like most newer phones nowadays have similar thickness. Getting use to it now though. The price I paid was good value for money. This phone is packed with lots of good stuff that Android brings.', ""Very quick & responsive device even with many apps running in the background. Works with AT&T 4G LTE in the Austin, Texas area. Only has European charger with US adapter which makes the heavy thing come unplugged from weight. Display is clear and vibrant but could be a bit brighter in direct sunlight though still usable. Device has barely become warm while in the case, charging, and being used heavily simultaneously. Battery lasts all day. Camera is excellent but LED flash could be brighter; backfill lighting possible though. Headphone jack on bottom! The pearlescent backplate appears to almost be illuminated in the correct lighting. Facial recognition works great and the fingerprint scanner is the best I've encountered. Speaker and earpiece are pretty loud for what they are. NFC functions great. The Realme XT is far better than any Samsung I've owned. Highly recommended!"", 'Fantastic phone.  Switched from a Galaxy S7 Active, and very happy from day 1. Substantially larger screen while keeping the overall phone a similar size (screen to phone ratio is 90%+).  The camera is insanely high quality, with cool wide angle feature.  The switch over was made very easy by Google phone setup and Clone Phone app.  I have all my messages, contacts, files, etc by using both transition apps - there were instructions included on how to.  An easy YouTube search showed how to move my AT&T sim card.  In total, setup and transition took about an hour, and I was right back to calling and texting.  So shocked at the quality and price point.  Highly recommend that you make this transition *yesterday* if you have a 2-3 year old phone and a SIM Card based plan.', 'Esta muy oadre la.calidad de las fotos, me encantó esta parte, funciona muy rapido todo, el issue mayor ha sido el audio, a veces no se escucha bien y al e escribir se cierra constantemwnte la pantalla ya que esta muy junto el boton de minimizar al twclado, el resto funciona super bn.']"

If you would like to take advantage of that VOOC flash charge you will have to either find a US version, which I haven't found, or buy a OnePlus dash charger. If you go the OnePlus charger route just know that you must also have the type c cable that comes with the charger as it is a proprietary cable. If you use a regular type c cable it will only charge at regular speeds. All that aside the phone itself works well with cricket here in Sin City. The screen is very nice, the phone is very snappy, and color os 6(Android 9)/realme ui(Android 10) are actually pretty non intrusive. Now if you want Android 10 on this device just know that you will most likely have to manually update it. Most likely you will have to update to the A6 update before you go for the international c01(Android 10) update. Also the CEO has confirmed that Android 11 will also be coming to this phone. The phone is solid but I have to dock a star just because of the inconvenience of manual update+no true VOOC US charger. I do however recommend it if you are willing to forgive these slight inconveniences!"", 'This is not meant to be a comprehensive review but is offered just to clarify information that remains unclear in the product description. I cannot determine with certainty what bands this phone has. However, its FCC ID is 2AUYFRMX1921 from Dec. 13, 2019 and you could sort it out if you want. I have good coverage on T-Mobile in Seattle. It does have an NFC reader. It does come with a functional rapid charger for North American electrical outlets. Android 9 came installed. Updating to Android 10 was as simple as going into the settings and pressing ""update."" While I wish it offered just plain Android, Realme v1.0 is mostly unobtrusive, and a few of the extras may actually be useful. I don\'t believe it has wireless charging. It looks nice, has a fantastic AMOLED screen, the interface is fluid, and the camera seems fine with both wide angle and macro lenses. It puts to shame my iPhone X, which cost almost five times the price, even without accounting for Realme\'s preinstalled screen protector and included case. It\'s from the same manufacturer as OnePlus (BBK).', ""Got the phone and have been putting through the tests. Even though it is missing band 12/17 it is working quite well with LTE mode majority of the time. I am hitting a solid 2 and 5 most of the Twin Cities area.Beautiful screen, GPS worked solid, compass worked, snappy response, worked great with the games and apps I have tried. Not at all disappointed for what I got for the price.ColorOS was a little confusing but not hard to get used to even if you are used to iOS or stock android. No ads and most of the software that was pre-installed I could get rid of or ignore. Not a stock experience but didn't' feel it got in my way.Did come pre-installed with a screen protector and included a clear case - a bonus.Best surprise about this phone - since the one got shipped is the one from Russia/Europe it has NFC chip and the chip works great with Google Pay! I have already used it at 2 stores with NFC.Very happy and very impressed! Without a doubt I would buy it again."", ""Now that I've had this phone for several months, I feel that I can give a fair review. This phone is way more powerful than the phone I came from. I've never been one to spend $1,000 on a phone oh, but this sure feels like $1,000 phone. It has never gotten bogged down even during heavy video usage. Well I'm sure the camera could be better, it certainly does the trick for me. The battery life is pretty solid. With heavy use, I typically need a quick 15 minutes on the rapid charger to make it through the day. But again, most of the time I may be watching YouTube or streaming music. With mild use, I feel like the battery would very easily last through today and possibly through 2 days. I have T-Mobile, and have very good connection speeds. No issues with dropped calls, bad reception, or network issues. Honestly for the price, I feel like this phone is a steal!"", 'This phone is excellent.

It's heavy so it doesn't feel like a cheap phone. It comes with a clear case and a super fast charger. I have over 100GB of storage so what more could I ask for. I'm very impress and I agree: don't hesitate to try this phone. You won't be disappointed unless it  isn't fully compatible with your phone carrier."", 'Display is crystal clear, both rear facing and front facing cameras take crisp pictures, sleek and elegant overall design, beautiful packaging.

Battery life with heavy usage(surfing, radio streaming, extended phone calls, while connected to two Bluetooth devices is good, about 18hours, which is good, but could be better.

Small enough to hold in purse.', ""I purchased the 128GB with 4GB ram model in all black.  My wife's S8+ that was close to becoming non-functional and I needed a new phone asap.  I had previously purchased an A20s for my son and so I first ordered the A30s until I did some research regarding my mobile provider T-Mobile in the US.I cancelled the A30s and got the A51 primarily because of the supported LTE bands. T-Mobile uses the following bands2, 4, 5, 12, 66, 71The A30s only supports band 5 from the that list!However, the A51 supports band 2, 4, 5, 12 and 66.  I was gladly willing to pay a little more to ensure I had maximum connectivity with my carrier so I cancelled the A30s and purchased the A51 instead.Now with that primary consideration out of the way, on to the rest of the review.  I'll start with the best parts first.1.  Call quality, reception and connectivityThe call quality is excellent on this phone, right up there with my s10+.  I think the microphone quality has been improved because my wife loves using the speakerphone and on her hold s8+, her voice occasionally cut out here and there as the mic tried to pick up her voice.  Also, the sound quality of the voice has improved as well which further helps to understand the conversation.  Reception has been about the same compared to my s10+, which is to say pretty good.  We measured on signel strength and asu.  The mobile data speeds are excellent even in areas that are typically weaker in signal strength.2.  ScreenSamsung AMOLEDs are the best in the business when it comes to screen quality.  We are a little relieved the screen is not curved because this allows us to get a robust case to protect everything.  The colors, quality and resolution are all indistuingishable compared to my s10+.  The front camera is a tiny pinhole so the entire body is pretty much all screen.  There is an in-screen fingerprint reader which is optical, rather than infrasonic on my s10+ but it is still reasonably fast to unlock the phone.  Yes it is slightly slower than my s10+ but we're talking milliseconds of difference.3.  General usabilityMy wife is not a gamer so I can't say anything about the gaming experience but she does use a ton of media and productivity apps.  For all of her use on them so far, she says they feel snappy.  They all open fast and transition well and she multitasks as much as before without a shred of difference.  When we first setup the phone, we were concerned because there was some UI lag but realized a lot of processing was being used during the Samsung Switch, which transfered her entire old phone to the new phone.  Once the switch was done, we rebooted and the phone was responsive and fast.4.  CameraThe camera hardware has some beefy specs.  But for a mostly point-and-shooter, it's hard to really go wrong many camera setups.  Picture quality looks great in the light and not as good in the dark compared to my s10+.  The slower camera speed is noticeable, transitioning between the main camera/wide/macro takes about a half second, where on my s10+ is pretty much instant.  The shutter is just as fast, luckily.  If camera speeds are important to you, you would probably not be happy with this phone.5.  BatteryI have to admit, we were looking forward to getting more usable time out of the battery.  The battery is 4000mah unit and the s8+ was only 3500mah.  However, through the typical daily use, we found that the end-of-day percentage left were about the same.  We average about 4 hours of on-screen time scattered throughout the day with app use and web-browsing and the battery was around 40% left, which is the same as the s8+.  If long battery life is important to you, you would not be happy with this phone but keep in mind, it can easily last an entire busy day on a single charge.Overall, we like the phone for the price of under $300."", 'Since this is a dual sim phone it was made primarily for international use.  Although it was made for international use it works fine in the states.  The big benefit is that this phone has been available in Europe for quite awhile, thus a good price drop of the mature  international Samsung A51.  Standard is 4 GB of memory and 128 GB of storage (not to many phones come with that amount of storage).  The Samsung A51, American only model, has recently come out in the states and is considerably more expensive than the mature international version dual sim phone.  Another fringe benefit, you can put two sim cards in the phone (only one is active at a time) but that allows you to have two different phone numbers for a single phone.  The only surprise was turning it on for the first time.  Everything was in Spanish.  All of the initial setup was in Spanish.  So, I backtracked displays a bit until I found an early display that allowed me to change the phone over to US ""English"" language.  From that point on it was smooth sailing.  Without a doubt, this was the easiest phone to set up I have ever owned.  There is a Samsung App called Smart Switch (available from Google Play) that you put on your old phone that talks to a comparable Smart Switch on the Samsung A51.  It basically transfers Apps, Files, Contacts, Calendars, Etc. from the old phone to the new one.  In not sure if it is using NFC or Bluetooth, but it work great in transferring everything.  It tells you what it could and couldn\'t transfer. The Quick-Start Guide is a little thin, I would highly recommend getting the PDF Users Manual from the Samsung Home Page!  The manual is 197 pages, it unlocks the myriad of features on the phone.  There is a Virtual Assistant ""Bixby"" included.  Bixby seems to be much smarter than ""Alexa"" or ""Siri"".  A nice surprise was the compatibility of the phone with my cars Bluetooth phone system.  It paired effortlessly with the car and it also downloaded the entire contact list from the phone into the car system.  I haven\'t had the phone long but thus far I have had a lot of ""great"" surprises.  This was a great value getting the price break due to it being a mature international version of the Samsung A51.  I will follow up after I use the device for a while to update my initial assessment of the international version of the Samsung A51 Smart Phone.  There is a clear plastic display  protector pre installed, there was nothing in the package that mentioned that.', 'When I came across this phone, I immediately was intrigued by its near-premium performance at a budget price. It claimed to have a 48-MP quadruple rear camera, a punched-in selfie camera, a large screen, lots of internal memory, extended memory, and a top-of-the-line look and feel. It had every benefit of the Android flagship phone at a discounted price. When I unpacked it, the phone did not disappoint my expectations: the camera took high-resolution photos, the screen was bright and colorful, it was running a fancy current android version, and it was handling all of my apps pretty well. Now here are a few things that could have been better. One, the native camera app is a bit slow. And when I say slow, I mean slow. It takes a full second to open. And when you take shots, one needs to wait for the shutter sound and for the photo to appear in the window before one moves the camera to the next spot or subject. Two, there is also no video-stabilization, so while the videos are pretty good, you need to hold the camera super steadily or use a tripod.Additionally, the phone is not water resistant, hence be careful or get a water-proof case as I did. Before I did, I accidentally submerged this phone in a stream near a waterfall. That gave me a good scare because both the cameras and the screed fogged up within an hour. Later the screen went completely blank green and stayed that way for a few days until the moisture inside dried up. The impressive thing is that after drying, the phone survived, and the screen and cameras returned to their normal functions with no noticeable effects.Unfortunately, ATT started sending me text messages that they will not be able to support mobile data on this model soon. They claim it is an enhanced 3G phone that can operate on a 4G LTE network. Not sure how much of this is true. The phone displays LTE or LTE+ signs. Maybe ATT just wants to push a new phone on me. Besides this, the overall experience with this phone is fantastic.', 'I have been looking for a decent dual sim phone with true dedicated storage expansion for some time.  Many options have been dated or are weak in at least one area making the choice a compromise.  I also run a Galaxy Note 10+ which is a great phone but it was promised at release to be dual sim.  That never materialized.  Dual sim and separate microsd capability was important to me for travel and having work and media files at the ready - all at the same time.  Too many choices had ""hybrid sim"" where you have to choose between the second sim and sd card - not my definition of the concept.  Many came with weak camera specs and processor but I wanted a phone that had it all.  This is the closest I have come.  I have tried the A50, the A70, the Honor 8 pro and even waited around for the Umidigi F2 (which the jury is still out on).  There were others also.  This in my view is superior.  The A51 has decent power and capability even with ""only"" 4GB.  LTE bands have been comprehensive for my needs and I get all the other requirements I had fulfilled.  I have not done a lot with the camera as yet but it is a definite improvement over the current Samsung A series and the other phones I tried (excepting the Note!).  Phone build quality is good, reception has been good, no noticeable lag like I got with some of the other phones I tried.  Fingerprint sensor better than the Note and battery life is equivalent to the Note.  All in all, very good bang for the buck. Relatively speaking, a great price for a phone that ticks all the boxes. An added benefit is this phone is smaller than the Note 10+ and is surprisingly tactile to the point this phone has become my go-to.  4 stars out of 5 as I wonder if a 6Gb (or even 8Gb) version would have been superior.  No regrets on this purchase.  Recommend highly if your needs are similar.  Buy a protective case, too.', 'bon', 'I had the galaxy a50 for only a couple of months before dropping and breaking it. I wasn\'t wanting to spend so much this time so figured I would check amazon. To my pleasant surprise, I could get the a51 on amazon for a little less than I paid for the a50 at walmart.I got this unlocked a51 so I could use it on my straight talk plan. Things were a little confusing at first because LTE was not working after I set the phone up. After some research, I discovered this was due to APN settings. To solve this, you need to go into settings. Then from there, select connections. Then go under mobile networks, and select access point names. You are going to google the APN settings for whatever network you are using ( I googled apn settings for straight talk 2020). Once you are on access point names in your settings and you know the proper values to put in, you will click ""add"" at the top right corner. Place in the correct values. Very important that once you add in those values, click the 3 small dots in upper right corner and hit save, otherwise you will have to do it all over again. Make sure the correct apn name is selected after you save. I hope these directions aren\'t difficult to understand,  but if you have issues just google it.The phone has an AMAZING camera, both front and rear. More than double the megapixels of any other camera I have had. The images are crystal clear. You can take very professional looking photos using the live focus when you are on the camera.The a51 feels just slightly more heavy than the a50. It feels more robust and sturdy than the a50. Sorry my comparrisons are all related to the a50 but I don\'t have any other comparrisons really.I have only had this phone for 2 days so I don\'t know all of the phones features yet.', ""After learning about the A51 differences I would like to say that model SM-A515F/DS has 128GB internal storage, 4GB of RAM and doesn't have NFC setting. Model SM-A515F/DSN has 128GB internal storage, 6GB of RAM and has the NFC setting.I purchased the Samsung Galaxy A51 Prism Crush Black phone April 27, 2020 and two days later the phone was at my doorstep (just the phone). The box came in completely sealed and it had all the accessories. After going through all the configuration (I did not setup fingerprint or face recognition at the beginning) I was in business. The colors on the Samsung Galaxy A51 are amazing. I did make a change under Settings > Display > Screen Mode, from Natural to Vivid and turn on Dark Mode. The fingerprint is under Settings > Biometrics and Security > Fingerprints. It took me a while to be able to setup fingerprint. Honestly did it like 30 times until it read 100%. You will have to move the finger to different angles until it reads your fingerprint completely. Every time it reads new lines the percentage goes higher. Once I was done, I tested it and it worked fine. I used all other 9 fingers different angles to see if it would let me login, and it DID NOT. The phone does take great pictures. I tested the macro on one of my dogs nose and WOW, the pic was stunning. The pic of a lizard was taken in macro. Calls are clear and it shows LTE with strong signal.  I am registered with MetroPCS and my dad with AT&T. I used my dad's AT&T sim card and it worked (picture shows Metro by T-Mobile, AT&T).The phone does have 4GB of RAM. When I purchased mine the price had drop to the point I couldn't pass it. I didn't see anything on Amazon page at that time, but I don't care, I'm very happy with the phone.Aside from the A51, I purchased a Feitenn Samsung Galaxy A51 Metal Case (ASIN B0839C38GM). The case is sturdy and it DOES protect the phone. The screen protector IS NOT attached (together) to the metal case like it shows on the pictures, and the screen protector IS NOT gorilla glass, it is just regular and it doesn't have the whole for the front camera. I placed an order for 3 Tempered Glass (ASIN B082S7NCB8).Thanks"", 'Llego en el tiempo estimado, el producto correcto y nuevo, tras ya varios meses de uso funciona como nuevo, su pack de 4 camaras dejan muy poco que desear, ya que incluso en el modo automatico de la camara de samsung toma muy buenas fotos, el estabilizador de video funciona bien para el precio del producto, el modo macro funciona bien tambien, la pantalla tiene un buen campo de visión dependiendo del angulo y tiene una relación mas angosta que el de otros celulares de la marca que he probado, una muy buena sensación en mano, y no se siente como un telefono de 6,5 pulgadas. la carga rápida es buena, pero deja que desear, pero por 15 watts supongo queno se puede pedir más, la duración de la batería es bueno en general, dandole un uso moderado me ha durado 3 días, y lo máximo de tiempo en pantalla han sido 8 horas 40 minutos, que, insisto, para su precio y capacidad esta muy bien. el sensor de huellas no es lento, pero al no ser ultrasónico, hay sensores físicos por asi decirles que funcionan más rápido, Las 4 gb de ram son suficientes y por lo normal tengo entre 1.3 a 1 gb libre usando un launcher de terceros, así que supongo que si usas el ui deberá de andar con más espacio libre, sus 128 gb de espacio yo los siento interminables. En la cuestión de software es un telefono que al menos de aquí a dos o tres años se mantendrá al pie de las actualizaciones, a la fecha que escribo esto ya se actualizó a one ui 2.5 y con android 10, aunque preferiria siendo sincero que trajera un procesador snapdragon, el exynos 9611 no se queda tan atrás, siendo la competencia directa del snapdragon 662.En general considero que es buen telefono que justifica su precio, además de que estéticamente es muy bello,', ""All those people complaining about the phone not having 6 gigabytes of ram did not look close at the description before buying make sure you know what you are getting. That being said, I have had this phone for 10 days and it has been great, only a few times have I had issues with the device lagging while scrolling on web pages or opening apps but I have not has anything else like that happen to me since those first 2 times, which I think is pretty acceptable considering the price.The camera(s) are fantastic, I have taken some photos of my birds with this and if you zoom in really far you can see their small individual feathers, which is a big upgrade from my old Motorola E4 smartphone I've had before this phone, the only downside is using the Google Street view app to take 360 photos because I guess the gyroscope is not top of the line, and there can be strange stitching results or large black parts in the photo once its processed even if you got all the photos in the augmented reality view in the first place, however I don't believe the blame all goes to Samsung as there's probably something wrong with the coding the developers wrote for the application.You can play games like Assassins Creed Identity, and Call of Duty which is great as well, and do basic video editing such as trimming, adding, and cropping. As of now however I have not experimented with how well the phone performs if you have a game capture application running as that's not a major concern for me.(As a side note to anyone who may be concerned with preinstalled malware or spyware as seen in some cheap phones, I have done many full system scans with the malwarebytes application for android in safe mode and have found nothing, so if you are coming from say a BLU Products phone which are well known to have Trojans and malware than you shouldn't be worried about anything like this for this phone.)So to sum it all up, great mid-range phone with amazing camera(s), and you cant go wrong for the price, I defiantly recommend considering this phone.""]"

Nummer eins ist leider ersoffen.Geschwindigkeit, Haptik, Fingerabdruckerkennung, Gesichtserkennung, Akkulaufzeit, Dual-Sim: Alles wirklich OK.Bluetooth funktioniert auch mit meinen Endgeräten (außer TomTom - aber das war bei TT immer grottig) super.Im Vergleich mit meinem (dienstlichen) IPhone: Empfang und Klang: Besser.Nun zu der Besonderheit - das 'Makro'.  Hier bin ich unentschlossen. Man muss das Objekt sehr nahe an das Gerät bringen. Der Vorteil: es gibt wirklich schöne Bilder. Der Nachteil: Man beschattet das Objekt durch das Gehäuse. Vielleicht wäre eine ringförmige Beleuchtung um das Makro-Objektiv die Lösung (habe ich aber noch nie bei einem Smartphone gesehen).Sehr schön finde ich den fast komplett verstecken Lautsprecher und den 3,5 mm Klinkenanschluss für ein Headset. Fast die gesamte Frontfäche ist nun Display (bis auf die Aussparung für die Selfie-Kamera). Der Fingerabdrucksensor 'hinten' funktioniert gut, ist aber (wie bei IPhone) vorne besser, weil man das Gerät nicht in die Hand nehmen muss.Im Gegensatz zu anderen Androiden möchte ich das Fehlen 'Brand-eigener' Tools positiv bemerken. Kein Speicher belegt für ein drittes Mailprogramm oder andere Kaspereien.Ich vermisse das NFC (nicht wirklich).Die Hülle ist direkt mit dabei.Fazit: Ein paar Sensoren fehlen, dafür aber sehr günstig.Für geplagte 'Funklochbewohner' und Outdoor mit Dual-Sim eine perfekte Lösung."", 'Ergänzung nach 2 Monaten Nutzung:Aufgrund der vermehrten Negativkommentare zu Kamera und Bildschirm möchte ich hier direkt vorneweg anmerken: setzt euch bitte mit eurem Smartphone auseinander. Wie weiter unten in meinem Kommentar noch erläutert wird, ist die Belichtungszeit bei dunklen Motiven ungewöhnlich lange. Hier gilt es aber einfach das Smartphone nicht zu früh vom Motiv wegzuziehen, sondern die 2 Sekunden auszuharren. Ich persönlich habe mir das Smartphone vor allem wegen der Möglichkeit von Makroaufnahmen gekauft und bin sehr überzeugt von der Kamera. Trotz Blitzlicht sehen die Aufnahmen natürlich aus und werden in 9/10 Fällen beim ersten Versuch scharf.Zu dem Display: die Android Version liefert die Option ""Nachtlicht"" direkt im Schnellmenü (obere Leiste von oben runterziehen), was die Blautöne entfernt. Weitere Einstellungen sind in den Einstellungen unter Display, erweiterte Einstellungen möglich. Wem das Display mit der automatischen Helligkeitseinstellung zu dunkel ist, deaktiviert diese einfach und stellt sie manuell ein.Jetzt zum ursprünglichen Kommentar:Wie von Motorola gewöhnt, bietet dieses Smartphone ein gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis. Ausgestattet mit einem Octa-Core Prozessor und 4GB RAM ist eine flüssige Bedienung bei normalem Gebrauch konstant möglich. Anders als in vorherigen Rezensionen erwähnt, halte ich die Kamera für brauchbar. Mithilfe der Makro-Funktion können sehr nahe Aufnahmen vorgenommen werden. Von Nachteil ist hier jedoch die von Android mitgelieferte Foto-App. Diese versucht Fotos automatisch zu optimieren. Dabei entsteht unter Umständen ein Rauschen in den aufgenommenen Bildern. Die Installation einer anderen Kamera-App kann hier eventuell Abhilfe schaffen. Bei der Aufnahme von Bildern mit Blitz in sehr dunkler Umgebung sollte außerdem die verhältnismäßig lange Belichtungszeit beachtet werden. Hierbei gilt es das Smartphone einfach ein paar Sekunden länger auf das Motiv zu halten. Durch die lange Belichtungszeit kommt es bei den Aufnahmen deutlich seltener als bei anderen Geräten gewohnt zu einer Über- oder Unterbelichtung. Außerdem wirken die Aufnahmen trotz Blitz sehr natürlich und der Realität entsprechend.Anzumerken gilt es weiterhin, dass die Rückseite des Smartphones nicht abgenommen werden kann. Der Akku ist fest verbaut. Die Sim-Karten bzw. Die SD-Karte werden in einen ausziehbaren Metallrahmen an der linken Seite des Smartphones eingesetzt. Dieser Metallrahmen ist nur mit Hilfe eines mitgelieferten Werkzeugs, mit welchem Druck auf eine dafür vorgesehene Vertiefung am Smartphone vorgenommen werden kann, ausziehbar.Meiner Meinung nach erfüllt das Smartphone was es verspricht.', 'Ho acquistato 2 apparecchi (uno per mia moglie, uno per mio padre), attratto dal forte sconto sul prezzo.Il prodotto si presenta solido e robusto, in una bella confezione viola.

This Samsung A20 is fast, has great colors.  I haven't bought anything by samsung since 2005 when I Bought their high definition projection tv which lasted exactly 91 days and they refused to fix it.  So it was with much hesitation that I bought this phone.  I still don't expect it to last that long.  Samsung is not like Apple.  They don't build things to last, only to look good for the little time that you have them before they break apart.  The first main thing that I noticed is that the encryption really works.  After you turn the phone on, the encryption doesn't really unencrypt until after you start the phone.  The volume is much louder than on most phones when you play music.  But the best part of this phone is the camera!  You don't have to try and focus on anything when you take a shot.  it does it automatically for you.  Not one bad photo.  Also you can use your fingerprint on the behind camera and it is deadly accurate.  ONLY my index finger will open the phone.  One problem though with samsung.  They have all these extra programs, bloatware, that they add onto the software that you don't need.  These programs eat up your tracfone data which can be expensive.  They also drain your phone very quickly.  I had to uninstall a lot of samsung programs.  Still, the phone antenna seems to be good since I have a cdma phone, which expires on Dec 31st, but verizon can't be beaten for its cell phone tower strategy."", 'I went to a Tracfone review blog looking for reviews on phones available with 3gb ram/32 gb rom and the Samsung A 20 was the first on the list.  There was a link that was active for $100 this was about a $49 dollar savings so I went for it.  I did my research prior so it was not a difficult decision to make.The screen is wonderful without being FHD - this is fine with me, but like all Samsung displays it is bright and crisp.  Another requirement for me was 13MP camera and  this phone comes with dual cameras 13 MP + 5 MP back and 8 MP front.  Have not played with it so cannot give a review of the camera, but I am sure that they are more than adequate for my needs.The phone came with Android 9, but Android 10 is immediately available for download - it install without a problem.You cannot use generic usb cable for charging; the cable appears to be unique to Samsung.So far I am happy with my purchase.', 'I love this phone, got mine when they were cheaper, and its fast.  I really need to be able to record my calls and you cannot do that on this phone.  No built in feature and all 3rd party apps will not record.  Samsung is telling people to check with the app developer, but I have tried 9 different apps before I gave up.  It is very annoying because I have to pull the sim card and put it in an old phone with a call recorder when I need to make calls I need to record and it means I can only record outgoing calls unless I just leave the sim in the old phone.Not too long after I left this review, they released the update to Android 11 and that fixed the call record option.

I opened it up, connected ot to my wifi and it was working as well as my Samsung. I never bothered setting it up with Tracfone, I didn't need to. He absolutely loves it and since the layout is the same as my Samsung he had no trouble navigating it. He is a happy boy."", 'Nice phone, replaced my real old one']"

After spending two weeks with my new pine green Oneplus 9 pro, to say that I am satisfied is an understatement. First of all, the screen is so bright and colorful, even in direct sunlight. The touch haptics is just perfect and the speed of going thru the apps is so fast and buttery smooth.  The warp speed charging brick that comes with the phone (you listening Apple, Google, Samsung) literally charges this phone from 20% to 90% in less than 16 minutes (unbelievable). I would say the battery life is above average and I get thru a whole day (16 hours) with still 20-30% left.But, my favorite feature of this phone is the voice to text accuracy. Now, before I purchased this phone, I visited a Best Buy store and the nice sales person let me try voice to text on this phone, the Samsung S21, and the Google 6 pro. To my surprise, the Oneplus 9 pro blew away the Samsung and Google pixel 6 in both accuracy of typing and speed. Now, it isn’t perfect, but I am very impressed with the google voice recognition. That alone was a deal breaker that leaned me toward the Oneplus.The camera in pro mode takes phenomenal pictures. Now, is it as good as an Apple 13pro or the new Samsung S22, maybe not, but I can’t tell the difference.Are there any cons on this phone. I couldn’t tell at this time and I hope that the future software upgrades don’t mess it up (recently oneplus has allowed 3 years of Android upgrades and 4 years of security updates, which is a nice bonus with this phone).So, in conclusion, I would highly recommend this phone. For what you get, 12 gigs of ram, 256 storage, 5G, wireless charging at 50W and reverse wireless charging, etc., etc, it really is a no brainer purchase.', 'With Google Pixel 3XL\'s spontaneously bricking all over the world, I decided it\'s better to be proactive and just get a new phone. I was originally dead-set on getting a Pixel 6 Pro - but seeing Google\'s execrable response to the bricking issue, I decided never again on a Google phone.The OnePlus 9 pro is a great phone. It\'s a fair bit heavier than my Pixel 3XL, but that\'s a minor complaint. Battery easily lasts all day. Screen is lovely. Occasionally it seems like the refresh rate clashes with an app and the scrolling will flicker and glitch.The camera takes lovely picture, I just wish some of the icons in the camera interface were a bit larger/more contrasty, they can be hard to make out (us old farts can\'t help having weak eyesight).Other than that, it performs very nicely. The one gripe I have is with their silly insistance on making the number ""1"" in the clock a dark red. There is no workaround. It\'s hard to see the \'1\' in sunlight. It\'s just goofy to ignore all the complaints and requests to just let us make the \'1\' look like the other digits.Is that enough to take a star off the review? Ha. No, it\'s a very fine phone, regardless.', 'Awesome phone in this price 👌Cheap price provides by Amazon thanks 😊', ""I really enjoyed the phone. The included rapid charge is amazing. Being able to run magisk without flashing roms and stuff is awesome. The camera works very well in every situation I have used it in, excepting dark shots, which I believe to be a weakness of all cell phone cameras. Being a oneplus phone , expect to have a more difficult time finding niche accessories. (I'm looking at YOU moment camera lenses) The screen is very nice, 120 hz is nic but tbh I would rather lock the display at 120 and charge more often than deal with the momentary switch where my eyes adjust to the higher frame rate. Finally, and most importantly, my battery has just about totally failed at this time in april 2022. I wont say I've done an excellent job not letting the battery die, but I have only ever used one plus brand chargers and now every now and then my phone will just outright die and require like six hours of charging to turn back on again. So i guess its a dope phone, and i really like it, but the battery recently started being bad. I can deal with needing to charge more often but the phone now dies and stays off until charge for like 6 hours uninterrupted."", 'My biggest gripe with the phone is the fact the native launcher does not support folders for apps, this is crazy to me. The other main issue is the camera is slow to take a picture, we are talking like 0.25 seconds so seems fast, but you never quite get the moment you though you did. The phone charges quick, is responsive, minimal bloatware, and decent power for the cost. Would recommend and plan to strongly consider OnePlus for my next phone.', ""While the phone is amazing and from what i can find on the web supposedly Verizon 5G Certified it unfortunately according Verizons Web activation service, online assistant, automated phone assistant, and the Verison technical support team isn't actually compatible with their service. regrettably i need to return the phone."", ""I really was hoping to switch from Pixel to One Plus, but......... The camera is not good, not even close to good, I had Pixel $ XL, which is half of the price and it's better. Even the Pixel 3XL is doing a better job, and I do not even talk about the branding and makes something good, don't just buy a logo to fake it !!!! The colors are weird and skin town looks fake!!!ANDROID AUTO DOES NOT WORK......I know, I tried ways to make it work, but you don't speed $1000 for a phone which keeps freezing while you drive!Also, I use APP PINNING, but by default, you can not use it, because you have to go to 3-way button mode, in order to make the app pinning available which is damn stupid, it's 2021, not 2016 to have a 3-way mode Android.Honestly, I wanted it to work, I like the church speed and the ring mode but man, without Android Auto, App Pining, and the colors and camera quality, NO!"", 'This is a decent phone unless you\'re expecting it to be on par or better than the OP8 Pro.They fixed a decent amount of bugs in this iteration, the screen is better and evenly lit with no green artifacts. The Bluetooth stack is functional and works properly with Chrysler/Fiat vehicles.That\'s where the notable improvements end though. The performance is terrible. It\'s worse than my OP8 Pro when measuring display latency from Steam link. You\'ll see around a 15% perf regression with this phone compared to the ""slower"", older and cheaper OP8 Pro.There\'s of course a high performance mode that they added to disable their throttling. Turning that on, the OP9 Pro closes the gap and reaches parity to around 2% perf improvement. That comes at the cost of significantly increased heat and a power draw roughly double that of the OP8 Pro.The perf issues on this phone are impressively bad. It\'s not likely this is directly OP\'s fault as Qualcomm has been suffering from power drain and performance issues in their entire portfolio. The last good SoC they made was the 865+.OP were likely very limited in their options to address these garbage chips without significantly increasing R&D and introducing expensive garbage like vapor chambers to hide Qualcomm\'s problems like Samsung has done.', ""I've ordered four of these phones now and all of them basically bugged out after the A12 update. I called Oneplus and the CSR indicated that this was not normal. I've finally given up. I'll just keep my OnePlus 8 Pro until this issue is resolved.""]"

Aun no he aprovechado la garantia llevandolo a reparar, pero a menos que esto sea un caso aislado ciertamente hay una debilidad en esa parte especifica del cristal y el protector con el que viene no ayuda ya que justamente deja desprotegido ese cristal.Tambien añadir que el reconocimiento facial no es espectacular, es seguro si, pero en la noche falla si no tienes un fondo de pantalla de bloqueo blanco o de algun color claro. No es malo, definitivamente lo puedes usar, pero tampoco es el mejor. No tiene jack para audifonos ni almacenamiento expandible.Por lo bueno:En potencia es el mejor, ningun gama media consigue mover los juegos mas exigentes en ultra y 60 FPS, no creo que nadie necesite mas que esto en ningun telefono. Sin mencionar que es muy estable y no se calienta mucho.La camara es muy decente, solo peca en el gran angular, pero en la normal y modo noche son las mejores de su precio y apenas se comienza a ver superado a los 500 euros por el pixel 6a y el Realme GT neo 3.El audio es estéreo; bueno y con mucho volumen.La conectividad es muy destacable aunque no sea algo que se suela mencionar. Lo compare con un Samsung Galaxy S10 5G y el Nord 2t alcanzaba redes en lugares que el S10 no solo no alcanzaba, si no que el Nord 2t conseguia reproducir videos en 4k sin problemas a esta distancia de la red.La pantalla es muy buena, hay algunos en la competencia que alcanzan mayor iluminacion y mas que 90hz, pero no lo veo necesario personalmente. El brillo maximo funcionan para leer en un dia soleado en la playa sin sombrilla (al menos para mi) y 90hz son mas que lo necesario.La bateria es muy buena, no solo por los 85w de carga rapida que te cargan de 0 a 100 mientras desayunas, si no por que dura facilmente 2 dias de uso constante, puede parecer que no por los 4500mAh, pero lo hace sin problemas. Definitivamente tiene una bateria de calidad y una buena optimizacion de software.El software es muy bueno. Algunos se quejan de que oneplus siga perdiendo identidad, aunque esto es cierto sigue siendo mi software favorito hasta ahora en opciones y fluidez, viniendo de haber usado Motorolas y Galaxy's hasta ahora.El Alert Slider pense que no lo usaria pero acabo siendo uno de mis motivos para no querer cambiar de telefono en muchos años, en una semana te acostumbras a el y lo usas tanto que te da pena pasar a un telefono que no lo tenga.Muy recomendado y le daria 5 estrellas si no fuera por esa rotura en el modulo de camaras. Si la garantia funciona bien posiblemente lo pase a 5 estrellas."", ""Dopo il reso di device di altro brand, non ho perso la seconda valida occasione di acquistare il nord 2T 5G ad un prezzo irripetibile con il prime day..Dopo appena 3 giorni di utilizzo è giunto il primo aggiornamento sulle patch di sicurezza e dopo un altro giorno quello relativo ad android 13..Il terminale risulta molto maneggevole non essendo nè grande e nè piccolo, con una buona fluidità e fotocamera nelle aspettative per un medio di gamma..Il display amoled ha un'ottima visibilità sotto il sole, ma almeno per me una piccola pecca sulla luminosità automatica che non permette l'impostazione di un parametro minimo a scelta dell'utente e con ambiente scarsamente illuminato il display tende ad essere troppo scuto, quindi lo utilizzo con luminosità manuale..Infine il dimensiti 1300 con i suoi 8 gb di RAM DDR4 mi ha sorpreso paragonandolo al kirin 980 - 7 nm con geekbench 6 ha dato i seguenti risultati: KIRIN/MTK single core 689/902, multi core 1942/3064. Non paragonabili ad un 8 gen 1 ma direi che per un medio gamma vale la pena acquistarlo. Infine la batteria con un uso medio intenso dura abbastanza a lungo solo che il caricabattere in dotazione da 80w mi appare anche eccessivamente veloce se si vuole salvaguardare la batteria e personalmente preferisco usarne uno di minore potenza con tempi di ricarica più lunghi ma evitando il surriscaldamento del device durante l'operazione."", 'One plus nonostante la discesa degli ultimi anni rimane una garanzia.

Ce serait à refaire, je ferais plutôt remplacer la batterie de mon Oneplus 6 plutôt que d\'en acheter un + récent ! Je ne pense pas que ce soit un problème de Oneplus mais plutôt de l\'industrie du smartphone dans son ensemble : elle fait du surplace depuis 5 ans et ne s\'occupe plus que de créer des modes (cf. les 2 gros ronds noirs à l\'arrière, bien clivant et qui seront bien has-been dans 2 ou 3 ans)...Points positifs (par rapport à mon Oneplus 6) après quelques jours d\'usage :- la batterie tient sensiblement plus longtemps, et se recharge super vite- écran avec poinçon plutôt qu\'avec un grosse goutte- always-on display- meilleure luminosité- son stéréo, et un peu plus puissant- Android 12 (mais j\'ai pas encore vu ce que ça m\'apporte par rapport au 11)Points négatifs :- Oxygen OS (la surcouche Android du constructeur) n\'est pas aussi bien qu\'avant : on ne peut plus renommer les applis ; le shelf est nettement moins facile d\'accès (à cause de cet enquiquinant ""Google Discover"" qu\'on ne peut que remplacer par une lamentable page blanche) ; la navigation par gestes n\'est pas aussi efficace que celle proposée avant (avis perso).- capteur d\'empreinte sous l\'écran pas aussi naturel que l\'ancien qui était situé à l\'arrière et qui trouvait naturellement sa place sous le doigt rien qu\'en prenant le téléphone dans sa main.

Quitte à prendre de l\'embonpoint, j\'aurais préféré 1 ou 2 mm plus large à la place.- un peu plus lourd (mais ça reste agréable)Je parle pas de la photo ni de la 5G car je m\'en sert quasiment pas...Bref, très bon smartphone pour qui n\'en a pas, mais ne faites pas comme moi : ne gaspillez pas 400 € si votre appareil n\'a que 4 ans et marche encore...

However after many years and replacement batteries it finally started to show its age and would spontaneously reboot. So although I had been putting off buying a new phone and saw models come and go I was forced to look and I chose the Samsung 10+ International  model. Setting up and using it on A&T network was a breeze, it took a little while getting used to the new interface and only a little regret for the loss of the Note4. I am liking it now. The 256Gb internal storage with the 256Gb sd card. It is fast and easy to use. The battery life is  amazing even with watching videos and net browsing I am getting well over 24 hours use and it charges fast. I have ditched the charger that came with it as it is an Euro plug with adapter cumbersome and replaced it with and Anker multi-port charger. I like the face recognition unlock it's easier than the long passwords I use. I'm still customizing it I didn't transfer my apps from my old phone wanted to start with a clean slate as always when I move to something new. I am an amateur photographer and almost never go anywhere without a camera so I was pleased to see that this phone has a quality camera built into it. I chose International because I didn't want any chance of it being loaded up with any phone companies software crap. It's fine it does come standard with SI units selected but that is easy to fix.Samsung Please understand that your registration and support app it too cumbersome and too complex to setup what's more why can't I have one login for all of my devices why insist on a different login for each I have enough to keep track with I am one person with many many devices. Would it be too difficult for me to have one login for me instead of telling me that name is in use choose another.The Screen is bright the detail is fine it would be nice to be able to magnify all screens, sometimes my eyes don't resolve so well and reading the fine writing becomes difficult. I know I could use a magnifying glass the screen is that good. but to be able to zoom in to read some things would be nice.I'm still exploring the capabilities and am not really disappointed with anything yet, it is a great phone, hope it lasts as long as my Note 4. Oh yes I would recommend it to anyone that needs a seriously sharp phone."", 'Comenzare comentando que esta un poco ingrigadi debido a los malos comentarios que existian con el vendedor, despues decidi buscar un poco mas de informacion por internet lo cual me arrojaba muy malos comentarios acerca del vendedor (fraudes), sin embargo decidi arriesgarme contando con el respaldo de AMAZON quien siempre me ha atendido de la mejor manera y me ha dado soporte a todas horasLo pedi y me me llego el mismo dia en que lo solicite, el empaque estaba en perfecto estados, al abrir la caja me encontre con la caja del celular , la cual contaba con lls sellos de samsung correctamente , sin estaf violados o maltratados, al abrirlo me encontre con el equipo, audifonos, cable usb tipo c por ambos lados, adaptador OTG Y cable de carga,El equipo venia cubierto por plasticos pre-instalados por las orillas , parte frontal y traseraTodo estaba nuevo y en perfecto estadoLo encendi y aun venia con android 9 pre-instlado , sin embargo al realizar las configuaraciones necesarias se termino actualizando a ANDROID 11 , El funcionamiento del equipo es asombroso, las funciones que te da el S-pen, la gran pantalla y el excelente audio hacen un comolemento genial , si eres un usuario promedio que solo entra para ver redes socuales y comsumir mumtimedia en general es una opcion mas que sobrada, estafas muy satisfecho con el equipo sin duda algunaLa bateria me ha durado todo el dia, llegando a casa con el 10-8% usando el GPS,youtube,amazon,facebook, spotify con auriculares inalambricos todo el dia y algun juego durante poco tiempoSe carga aproximadamente en una hora y 15 minutos', ""So far I'm loving this. I have no idea what the bad reviews are about. I got this to replace a ROG Phone II because I didn't like how there was nothing to protect from intrusion by dust and water. For almost everything I do, it's nearly as fast, and for some things it's faster. If you haven't used a Samsung phone before, the One UI 2.0 is really good as far as making sure that things run well, and the speakers despite being side-firing are a treat.My favorite feature has to be how the S-Pen lets you use the phone underwater. With only one point of contact - the pen - it is able to figure out what you're touching by looking for the pen and ignoring your fingers. If I'd been told about this I'd probably have jumped on board a long time ago.The biggest con for me is that the S-Pen isn't integrated into almost anything. I imagined that I'd be able to swish it around to scroll every window, use gestures to go to the top and bottom of web pages, click the button to go Back, double-click it to view Recent Apps, and none of that exists. It's just there for writing and doing gestures in the Samsung apps. This is a huge missed opportunity and is minus one star for me.Otherwise, loving it! Big screen, durable, the whole shebang. If you're a mobile artist like me, there's no other game in town. Every other stylus phone has a worse camera, worse specs, or is lacking in some other way.

A quick note (hehe, see what I did there?), My Last phone was the Galaxy Note 8, I only bought a new phone because, after two and a half years of use, the battery no longer lasted more than 5 hours and my screen had finally cracked after dropping it about 30 times...The phone:Pros:-Great Camera- I love all of the features that Samsung has included including using gestures and the S-Pen for Camera control- Fast-Good Battery Life. Fast charge. It will still be on 40% by the end of the day, but they've made the system much smarter and it will turn various background running programs to conserve battery.-Delivers everything you expect from the Flagship phone and more-The international version always includes an adequate case in the box. I've never bought new directly from Samsung US, so I don't know if this is the case for the US Version.Cons:-Finger Print ID: This tends to need extra pressure on the sensor to read your fingerprint. Luckily I have both Finger and FaceREC set up, so if one isn't working fast enough, the other does.-Layout (this is a personal preference) It has changed since the Note8, and I don't like it.

‎PAGL0002US,Motorola One Action | Locked | Made for US by Motorola | 4/128GB | 16MP Camera | White,Smartphones,S$509.70,https://www.amazon.sg/Motorola-Action-Locked-128GB-Camera/dp/B07WF9K475/ref=sr_1_363?qid=1695968277&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051%2Cp_72%3A6469119051%2Cp_36%3A20000-150000&rnid=6450031051&s=electronics&sr=1-363,https://www.amazon.sg/Motorola-Action-Locked-128GB-Camera/product-reviews/B07WF9K475/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,4.3,"['This phone punches well above it\'s weight! Despite only having 4 GB of RAM, the Motorola One Action runs smoothly thanks to running nearly stock Android and it\'s more-than-capable Exynos 9609 processor. At around $250 (at time of purchase), the Action blows away everything else in its price range.Pros:+ Android One(ish?) - Despite what many are saying in the Q&As, the US model is being treated as an Android One phone by Motorola. It\'s not 100% stock Android, but it\'s pretty close, with just some minor UI improvements. It *will* receive Android updates just like all Android One phones according to Motorola\'s website. ""The phone initially launched on Android 9 Pie and will receive OS upgrades to Android Q and Android R; security updates will be provided for three years from the initial global launch date of August 2019.""+ Excellent haptic feedback - this is important to me because I have low vision. Vibration feedback helps me a lot. Unfortunately, most phones in this price range have horrible vibration engines. The Action, however, has one of the best I\'ve ever used. The only phone that is comparable is the iPhone, which is considered to be the gold standard for haptic feedback. The vibrations are tight and percise; they don\'t make the phone rattle, either.+ Moto UI enhancements - I really, really like stock Android. Most of the UIs released by Android phone makers these days are horribly complex and really take away from the intuitiveness of Android as designed. I haven\'t used any other Motorola Android phones, so I can\'t speak for those, but Motorola did an excellent job here with keeping the stock Android look and feel. This phone includes their iconic circle clock/weather/charge widget, which I\'ve fallen in love with. It also includes a nice ""peak display"" where you can see if you have notifications at a glance while your screen is off. But the star of the show is the one button nav feature. It\'s what the Android 10 gesture navigation should have been. It\'s very intuitive and gets out of the way when you don\'t need it.+ The earphone and bottom speakers are loud and clean.+ It fits easily in one hand without sacrificing screen realestate.+ Headphone jack - my last phone didn\'t have one and it was super inconvenient. I had to use a USB C adapter if I wanted to use wired earphones, which likely attributed to the early death of the phone due to the USB port failing.Cons:- The battery life is OK, but not great.- The front camera hole punch is way too big and looks stupid. I\'ve gotten used to it and it doesn\'t bother me as much as I thought it would (I almost didn\'t buy this phone because of it).- It\'s one of the cheapest feeling phones I\'ve ever used, even at this price. The edges between the sides and back are sharp at the corners. This can be mitigated by putting it in a case (see my next point). The screen itself is very nice, though.- There aren\'t a lot of accessories for this phone. The options for phone cases are few. None of the screen protectors available for this phone were actually designed for it, so I\'m going without one.', ""Honestly, this is probably the best phone I've owned.  I've had some cheap ones and I've had some expensive ones.  The Moto is the only one I don't get irritated with.  It just does what I want without all the stupid software limitations that plague the Samsung, Apple, Sony, Asus, and ZTE phones that I've owned.  And it's fast.  There's no lagginess or waiting around with this phone.  Does it have the greatest screen, processor, camera, latest features?  No, but like I said, it's still fast with a good camera and I don't find myself wishing it has something it doesn't.  The screen looks great to me.  Really the only negative is the battery life.  Is it terrible?  No.  It lasts all day, but I've definitely had much better battery life.  I'd recommend this phone in a heartbeat.  One thing I almost forgot, I requested a replacement of the first one I received because it had something on the screen (glue?? not sure what it was) I thought wouldn't come off.  I'd clean it and dirt and fingerprints would stick to the same area no matter how much I cleaned it.  Even used alcohol wipes.  It was weird.  The second phone had the same issue.  Same spot, same shape.  I got the idea to get the car polish from the garage and try to clean it up with that.  It worked.  Wish I had just done that with the first one.  If you have that problem, now you know what to do.  Must have been some type of hard glue/resin from the manufacturing process.  Hope this helps."", ""So, I bought mine on January 24, 2020 for $272. And today, March 11, 2023, my Moto 1 Action is still functioning like new. My sister (and her kids) changed phones (well known, fancy brands) numerous times in that period -- perhaps I take good care of mine better.But, why pay more for a brand name? This phone has features that make one's life easier. Like, shake to turn flashlight ON/OFF -- this feature alone has roots in human history. Take a screenshot by touching screen with 3 fingers. I find the colors (+adaptive light, attentive display) on this screen to be more eye-friendly than most phones I see.Let see how many more years it can live!"", 'UPDATE: Phone has sent me an error message on a black screen that my device has failed verification. I have never seen this on any phone before.  I\'m wondering if unlocked phones are not worth buying anymore. Guess I\'ll tough it out with this one for now.Battery life is NOT 3 days... It\'s hardly one day with average normal use(moderate Wi-Fi use, screen brightness medium and I am not a gamer). I bought this phone to replace my Redmi Note 6... While I am better off with the Motorola, I am thoroughly disappointed with the claim for long battery life, It\'s just not true! Another annoying feature is the drop down notification shade-if you open an app that contains ads and you select the""x"" to close it, it\'s so close to the drop down shade that it would pull down instead of closing the ad! Grrrr, very irritating. Otherwise, the display is great(although the brightness level leaves something to be desired as it always appears dim even at average brightness)  camera/video decent, phone call quality amazing and the overall appearance is nice, I bought the white one.  Glad I bought it when it was on sale for $226. I now see it\'s over $300! It\'s definitely not worth $200+, leave alone $300.', 'Just like computers, smartphones degrade overtime, you no longer get Android OS updates, and pretty soon the battery life is worthless. Android phones - most all i know of - have been following suit to Apple\'s no easy way to replace the battery model. Pretty soon the old phone is a paperweight that has to be recycled. So why invest in a $700 phone when it will be worth $10 in 3 years? I guess that is why i decided to go with a NEW but slightly older phone (2019). The Moto Action One works just fine and the battery life is fantastic (day-3days depending on use) compared to my old one that had to be plugged in all the time.Since buying it, it already got the Android OS update to 10. It has a lot more space than my old phone did and I only paid $230? $250 for it. It works just fine, and i know in 3 years I will probably have to get another one. What made this transition seamless was I am on Google FI. I ordered a new sim card from Google, got my phone which was unlocked and non-carrier specific. I put my new sim card in, turned on the phone, followed Google Fi\'s instructions (very easy) and I was ready to go!  I didnt need a person to ""change over"" anything.Because all my contacts, etc are in Gmail, your phone will use that. It was very seamless, the phone works perfect!!! I will do this in another 3 years and this saves you lots of money.', 'Do not purchase this if you are on Sprint. Both Motorola and Sprint say this is compatible with their Network, but Sprint could not find a SIM card to work with this. Luckily I was on month-to-month because my contract was over. I ended up going to Walmart and getting a Straight Talk SIM package. I put in the Verizon tower SIM card and was up and running in seconds. This was after a week of trying to activate it with Sprint and many hours of being on hold with customer ""support"" and trips to every local Sprint store. This is a great phone and I have no complaints with it. I started with the original Droid before switching to Samsung Notes. After the Note that was recalled for catching on fire and the increasing prices, I went back to Motorola. I do a lot of photo and video editing as well as multi-track audio recording with a DAW and this phone performs just fine rendering huge files. A flagship might run a little faster, but at a third of the price I don\'t mind waiting a second or two longer on the really big files.', ""I usually buy Samsung phones so I was a little dubious about a Motorola product, but I thought I'd give it a shot. As the title say's an android is pretty ubiquitous, so the only differential is in the hardware.Cons:  The screen is smaller than I'd like, so I get the fat fingered misspelling effect when texting.  The Battery life isn't what it could be for a new phone (Qualifier: I work in IT & have supported mobile devices, so I know what I'm talking about).  It is a little weak with wi-fi acquisition, but nothing that would be a deal-killer.Pros:  I was pleasantly surprised how seamless the Verizon activation was.  I often use it for music playback & it performs well.  Takes great photos and streams online content with no lag.I guess time will tell, but so far I'm happy with the purchase."", ""I normally buy used phones and stick to Android. This was almost as much as I paid for my last phone and it's brand new. It's shocking to me that people will shell out over $1,000 for an iPhone when you could pick this up for a fraction of the price.Battery is much better than any other smartphone I've had. Camera is obviously fantastic. You can unlock the screen using face recognition, passcode, or the fingerprint sensor.It updated right away to Android 10, it looks really crisp on the screen. Unfortunately I do not think CyanogenMod has support for this phone but they might in the future.Also it came with a case which I didn't realize!I was worried about it because it's very long but it actually fits in my hand quite well."", ""It's a good phone without a hefty price, graphics are more than plenty for gaming but the phone is more known for the action camera. I'm not a fan of the plastic body or the speaker being at the bottom but sound quality is good and Dolby makes a difference specially when using wired or wireless headphones. Really like the wide screen for video and the front camera hole doesn't bother me but may bother others. Now the finger print sensor is not accurate at all , I was due for a new upgrade from my moto g5+ and I really do enjoy this phone and have been happy with Motorolas products but I am very nervous about the plastic body specially coming from the G5+ which has a metal frame and back. Now Motorola is not very good when it comes to software updates."", 'I bought this particular phone because the info given stated it could be used with my Verizon account in my area. But it could not. I assume there is no fault with the phone itself. It is simply a model not compatible with my provider. Because this wasted much of my time and effort in replacing my old phone which had crashed, I give a rating of just 4 stars.']"

On sale, it\'s a great deal!Hardware:The processor is mid-range not flagship-level, but the phone feels snappy in basic day-to-day tasks, which was my #1 concern. The screen is bright, crisp and has no notch; just a tiny ""hole"" for the front camera lens. Nice.The phone comes with 4 GB RAM and 128 GB of storage. I added a MicroSD with another 128 GB of storage. Ample RAM and plenty of storage.The phone also has a relatively large screen, which I also wanted, and has all the 4G LTE bands for T-Mobile including 66 and 71 (unlike its dual-SIM International counter-part, which does not have at least one of those bands, from what I\'ve read). It also has other LTE bands which are used by carriers outside the US (as shown in the specs).In addition to the usual Wi-Fi and BT radios, this phone also has NFC, unlike many other phones in this price range (like almost all Moto phones that I researched as well as some of the Chinese brands\' non-flagship phones).The screen protector glass that I use seems to make the fingerprint reader unable to recognize my fingerprints, so I would have preferred a separate fingerprint reader, but the phone does also offer face recognition, which I have not tried.One thing this phone does not have is an LED on front for notifications, but I don\'t really miss that, as you can see an ""always-on"" screen by simply double-tapping the screen.Software:I happen to dislike the design that Samsung used in their built-in apps like Contacts and Messages, where they block out a large portion of the top of the screen for just a title and some subtitle information, and begin the contacts or messages only about half-way down the screen. Once you scroll, you regain the whole screen, but I find this annoying to initially lose half the screen. Solution: Download the official Google Contacts and Messages apps and use those instead of Samsung\'s.One thing I do like in both Samsung and LG\'s customization of Android is that you can choose to have the bottom software back button on either the left, which is the ""Google"" default or on the right, which is the ""Samsung"" default. From what I have seen, Moto and perhaps others do not offer this option; the back button is always on the bottom left, not customizable to the right.I use the extremely customizable Nova Launcher (highly recommended) so I did not use the included Samsung Launcher.A big benefit to having a Samsung phone is the following: there is a ""feature"" of Android OS 10, about which many have complained online. If you connect a Bluetooth headset, and set that to play both phone calls and music, then your notification sounds will play over the headset only, not the phone\'s speaker. So if you are not wearing your headset and you get a text, for example, then you will not hear any notification sound.LG addresses this by enabling you to toggle from the notification ""shade"" whether or not to use the BT headset for only calls or for audio as well.But Samsung does better, in my opinion. It offers a free SoundAssistant app (downloadable from either their App Store or the Play Store but only for Samsung devices) which easily addresses this (and adds some nice features, like quick access to all volume sliders and more). I have it set to always play the notification sounds over the speaker, even if I\'m listening to music on my BT headset.Samsung and LG both offer software (typically included in the phone) that enables you to migrate from any old phone, including their respective competitors\' phones, to their own. Samsung calls this SmartSwitch. I was unable to use a USB-C to USB-C cable to do the transfer, but Wi-Fi direct did work to copy over all my call logs and other data. Google also can backup/restore some data from your Google Drive, but that does not include Call Logs and certain other data.Finally, since it is unlocked by Samsung, there are no hoops through which to jump (like calling the carrier for an unlock code, etc.) if you want to travel overseas and use a local SIM card; it\'s unlocked and ready to go.Other thoughts:My more recent phones have been LG Stylo phones, with the Samsung Galaxy S3 prior to those.I have been looking into a replacement for my old LG Stylo phone, which is very laggy as it comes with only 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage.Most of the Moto phones, for example, while reasonably priced, do not come with NFC. You probably won\'t miss NFC until you happen to need it. You could use NFC to transfer data from one device to another, though you can use Wi-Fi Direct instead, in most cases. Samsung actually makes good use of NFC with its Samsung Pay digital wallet, if you are interested in that.Bottom line: This phone is a very good all-around mid-range phone. On sale, it cost not much more than a typical low-end phone from T-Mobile or elsewhere. Unlike many other phones, it has NFC but, more importantly, it just works and does not lag.', ""Despite a number of other reviews claiming this phone doesn't work on Verizon, I had zero issues. Just swapped the SIM over and it connected to both LTE and phone service. My guess is that the people that couldn't get it to work ordered from a third party and weren't actually getting the US version. I ordered direct from Amazon, and got the advertised phone.The screen is the primary reason I was interested in this phone. It's beautiful. My last phone had a normie LED screen, and always looked washed out and inconsistent. This phone has a great OLED screen. It's the least expensive big-brand phone I could find with a nice OLED screen. It does not disappoint. Colors are vibrant and beautiful, and it handles very bright images and very dark ones really well. My only disappointment with the screen came from the aspect ratio: streaming video doesn't fill it up, and you end up with black bars on both ends as a result. That's just a matter of design, and no fault of the screen itself. I felt it worth mentioning because I ordered this phone primarily to improve my streaming video experience. It did, qualitatively, but the extra screen real estate is just wasted on black bars at the end. To be fair, the narrower aspect ratio does make it a lot easier to use as a phone...which is what it's for.Performance is good. I'm not a power user. I mostly just use a phone to stream video, browse the web, communicate by text, listen to audio books/music, and maybe the occasional phone call. I'm not very demanding of a phone's CPU. I've only run into an issue with slight stutter browsing sites that had too many ads that were in the process of loading, but that'd likely happen on any phone. Everything fires up very rapidly and I have no issues navigating anything.The camera is good enough. It's better than my last phone, especially at taking shots in darker rooms. It does a solid job of making everything look well lit. It does have it's limits. This isn't a Pixel. When I picked it up, it cost $200 less than the Pixel 3a XL, so I didn't expect it to hang in every regard.  I don't take a lot of pictures with my phone, so this wasn't a huge priority for me anyway. It does a good job with the simple stuff I do take pictures of, though, so I'm happy with it.Now, for the 100 ton elephant in the room: the fingerprint reader. It's not great. My last phone's fingerprint reader was located on the back, and it worked a lot better. My phone was unlocked before I'd removed it from my pocket because my index finger naturally found it's way to the reader. It was very organic. The location on this phone's fingerprint reader is really poorly thought out, and I suspect that's largely to blame for it's inconsistent performance. It's located where the phone's keyboard manifests, which makes it the dirtiest part of the screen. It sees the most finger traffic, so it accrues the most oils. That leads to some inconsistent readings.I did notice that if the reader won't recognize your print a few times, you can just wipe your finger over it to clear it, then try again. That usually does the trick, and isn't as disruptive. The issue seems to be false readings of print contours from buildup of dirt/oil over the reader. I've also taken to wiping the screen off here and there. That has significantly improved performance of the fingerprint reader. It's probably a good policy with any phone for accurate keyboard registration.I knew that in-screen fingerprint readers were a bad idea before I picked up a phone that had one, and I was right. It's more convenient when you've got your phone sitting next to or in front of you, certainly, but my phone's generally in my pocket. I grip the edges of it when I'm pulling it out, so in order to unlock it I have to move my thumb over to the keyboard after it's all the way out and level. It's clunky and inorganic to do one-handed, and will likely lead to some people dropping their phones. I do understand why it's appealing to some, especially if you work at a desk and keep your phone out and sitting on it. You can just touch the screen and it opens. For my normal use case it's just inconvenient. I'm hopeful that future phones will have both screen and back fingerprint readers to make unlocking under both use cases faster and easier, but I guess we'll see.Another issue I have with the reader is that it can only store three prints. You can't do both thumbs and both index fingers. I opted to do my left thumb and both index fingers because I keep my phone in my left pocket. That made it easy to open on a desk with either hand, or at least less clunky with the hand I pull the phone out with.I didn't bother with face recognition because I don't feel like something you can fool with a picture is smart enough to be considered security.All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase for the price. If this were a flagship with those issues on the fingerprint reader, I'd have returned it. However, the fingerprint reader problems are manageable with a little care, and this is a budget phone. I don't expect perfection. Ultimately, the solid performance and beautiful screen are worth it. I'd recommend this phone to anyone looking for something with a really great cost:performance ratio. This phone is great if you're not looking to drop a mortgage payment on a cell phone."", 'My review of the Samsung Galaxy A-50.I purchased this phone as an ""upgrade"" to my Samsung Galaxy S-6 Edge. The main reason was simply screen size. 5.1"" for the S-6 verse 6.4"" for the A50. I was also impressed with the cameras on the A50.  A 25 mega pixel front camera, with 3 rear cameras. I have not had a chance to check out the night time camera or slow motion video yet.From the camera screen it is very easy to change between the different camera functions such as normal and wide angle lens, video, slow motions, etc. I was pretty amazed at the difference in the amount of content that can be included in a picture taken using the wide angle lens, verse the normal lens. Incredible.The USB-C charging cable that comes with the camera is pretty much junk. It\'s only like 3\' long and pretty useless. I ordered a couple of 6\' cables from Amazon, and they are very high quality.The Fast Charging is pretty fast. Example: My S-6 was down to 68% last week. I plugged in the charger and it told me the estimated time to reach full charge was 2 hours 59 minutes. Today, my A50 was down to 28% and it charged to full capacity in about 2 hours. Have not tested to see how long the battery will last. I\'m not a big data user, mainly just Facebook and email. (Update: I charged it to full yesterday at about 1400 hrs. Today, at 1640 hrs, the phone is at 68% and that\'s with mild use.)It has a tear drop notch on the front screen to accommodate the front facing camera but thankfully it is not very obtrusive and allows for much smaller bezels around the phone.I have been having trouble getting the finger print scanner to work correctly. I\'ll keep playing around with it. I placed a screen protector on the phone so that might have something to do with it. I do have it set for Facial Recognition and that works well. I can only san approximately 75% before it shows me a message and I have to start over. I even removed the screen protector, to no avail.  For this reason I awarded the fingerprint scanner 1 star.Overall, I\'m pretty happy with my purchase. I\'d have to say this was a well worth upgrade.  IMPORTANT SCAM ALERT:I am now very disappointed. This is a copy of a portion of my Amazon invoice:Items Ordered Price1 of: Samsung Galaxy A50 US Version Factory Unlocked Cell Phone with 64GB Memory, 6.4"" Screen, Black, [SM-A505UZKNXAA]Sold by: Amazon.com Services LLCCondition: NewNote it states Condition: New.Well after receiving my phone, I went to the Samsung web site to register my ""new"" phone. It asked me for the IMEI number. When I entered it, the web site advised me the product was already registered!I\'m not an expert in these matters, and correct me if I\'m wrong,  but the only way a product can already be registered is if it was owned and registered by someone else, yes?So Amazon sold me a used/renewed product they listed as being New. Now I\'m left wondering how this is going to effect my manufacturers warranty, if one even exists for this product?????  Secondary UpdateI jumped the gun, and was a little unfair of my comments above. I spoke with John, an Amazon Customer Service Rep. After explaining this situation, he offered to either have me return the phone for a refund or he would send a replacement. I really like the phone so I opted for the replacement. He processed that before we even got out of chat and it will be here in a few days. He assured me the replacement will in fact be new, unused and unregistered, so I\'m back to being a big fan of Amazon. Thanks John', ""I had high hopes for this phone, especially after the online tech sites saying how great it is for lower mid-range device. I noted the drawbacks they mentioned including the fingerprint sensor, lack of water protection, and midling camera. Even so I was disappointed,because those aren't the issues that frustrated me to the point that I'm returning it.Let address the three above first:In-screen fingerprint sensor: it's not so bad on a bare screen. Slow, yes, but with practice you can learn how best to place your finger to get a hit most of the time.The issues arise when a screen protector is used. As recommended I tried to reenter my prints after adding one. I could only get to 41% no matter what finger I used then the phone would finally give up on that try. I won't use a phone without something on the screen so that's a huge fail.Lack of water protection: as someone who takes public transit in on the rain fairly often. The Moto g7, a supposedly lesser device but the one I ordered to replace this one, at least has a coating inside and out to repel the occasional splash or spill. I considered overlooking this, but the other drawbacks made that impossible.Camera: while the phone sports a 25 megapixel rear shooter it only engages using certain settings and can't be used in conjunction with HDR and other options that improve photos. The best shots will usually be captured using the 12 megapixel camera.The auto correction the a50 used is very aggressive. Unlike the g7 which will render picture brightness close to that of environment, the a50 ramps up the light making things look artificial. This is especially true for the selfy camera. A dim room results in overly bright, hazy photos with very heavy white balance. Returning to the rear cameras, the a50 often increases a sharpness to such a degree that outlines are black and subtle lines in people's faces become dark, heavy crags.Now for things that really soured me on this phone and caused me to return it...The display: several sites lauded the quality of the AMOLED display. In my opinion the blackest blacks aren't much deeper than the g7's LCD screen.The a50's display is definitely less sharp. Fonts and pictures are less crisp. I prefer a cooler color pallette, and the a50 is noticeably yellow even after using Samsung's custom color adjustments.The settings options: Samsung's One UI does offer some features not found in vanilla or near vanilla (eg, Moto phones) Android devices. That said, Samsung has either removed or buried in sub menus options that are present and easily located on more streamlined Android UIs.One thing I use every night is Do Not Disturb. On Moto devices, hitting the toggle brings up the option to easily set it for one to X number of hours. No such option exists on the a50. You have to go into settings and set up per day schedules if you don't want to remember to manually shut it off. There's no setting DND on the fly. This is simply one example of the UI isn't as user friendly as what I'm used to.Now the big one...Touch sensitivity and accuracy:  I've never used a phone that's so glitchy. Often the phone will simply stop registering touch input, especially near the top of the screen. Touching another area of the screen will sometimes restore function, other times it will not. Often I have to hit the home button several times before it registers.This behavior means that typing is far from accurate and simply a pain, especially if you use autocorrect. I followed the suggestions online to improve accuracy, including disabling accidental touch and increasing screen sensitivity. Neither improved my experience.In contrast, the Moto g7 screen is sensitive and accurate.  I've used it two days, and I haven't noticed a missed or incorrect input. In those two days I've gone back and forth between the g7 and the a50. Returning to the Moto g7 has like a breath of fresh air. It's simply a more relaxed and carefree experience.I really wanted to like the a50. I was excited to once again have NFC, a supposedly better camera, and a bit more screen area. Unfortunately those things aren't a substitute for a better everyday experience and confidence in the rain. That's especially true when the speed of both devices is almost identical. Online reviewers who put the display and camera ahead of the Moto g7 must be Samsung fanboys/girls."", 'Previous phones owned:BlackberryGalaxy Note IIBlu Vivo 5Honor 6XGalaxy A50I really missed my Galaxy Note II for its screen and great features.  AMOLED is the best screen period.  Sadly, one drop messed it up after 3 years of use.  Even in an Otterbox (adds like 5lbs to a phone) it did not tolerate a 3 ft drop on carpet.  Oh well.Had the Blu Vivo 5 until it took a weird shock to the corner of the screen on a steel table.  Too bad.  That LCD screen was great and the phone had great features.  Yes, that LCD screen was MUCH better than the current IPS screens on most phones.Shopped for a while and found the Honor 6X.  WOW!  Did not realize how great the phone, UI (or lack of), cameras, and speed could be.  Still works but I keep it as a back up.  2 issues with the Honor 6X, first, the “China” factor.  What the media says, makes you believe that China has a direct connection to these phones.  Second, the IPS screen is annoying.  Too bright and the off axis imaging is like looking at it thru window blinds.  Weird.  But, this is common on ALL of the IPS screens I’ve seen.  Great at burning your retinas☹.Shopped a while and found the Samsung Galaxy A50 for a good price.  Awesome Screen!!  Thank you AMOLED!  Horrible UI.  This phone is like a needy friend.  It’s always making dumb alerts for things I don’t care about or want.  I see 2 notifications for a voicemail.  One connects to the vm system to hear it.  The other is a text version of the same voicemail.  Dumb.  After I hear my voicemail and delete it, I get another notification 5 to 20 min later that the text version of it is available.  Why??  That is dumb and I don’t care, I deleted the vm.Other annoying features:1. If your screen is still on and you pocket the phone… it will open lots of apps and do lots of searches.2. Fingerprint reader is useless.  1 out of 30 tries will work.  My Honor 6X did fingerprint at 99% accuracy.  I really miss that.  Keying in a PIN EVERY TIME is SOOOO Annoying!3. Keypad is not accurate.  No smaller than the Honor 6X or Blu VIVO 5 yet I get so many mis spellings.4. Autocorrect is wrong and not intuitive.  Come on Samsung???5. Adding a contact or modify contacts is a challenge.  The terminology is messed up.  (Don’t do what Donnie Don’t doesn’t do).  You will find this in “Do not disturb” settings and other places as well.6. Music playback is bad on the single speaker.  Yup….there is one external speaker.7. Music playback on Bluetooth to a wireless speaker OR a stereo is Fair.  Connection is OK, the sound quality is not acceptable.  I’m an audiophile and the Honor 6X was better.  The Blu Vivo 5 was good too.  How can this newer phone sound so bad?Since I’m several years since my last Samsung phone, maybe I’m slow learning this Galaxy A50.  I may try and “root” the phone if that will get it to basic Android UI.  I’ve never done that to a phone but I don’t appreciate this Samsung UI at all.  I’ve owned this A50 for 2 months and I’m looking to replace it.If you are looking for a replacement phone (duh, that’s why you’re reading this), I would recommend this phone to an existing Samsung phone user.  I would recommend looking at other phones if you are used to a less intrusive UI.  The only other AMOLED phones NOT China made I can think of are the Google Pixel phones.  The OnePlus phones are hit or miss with screens.  The LG is a POLED and I have yet to see one in person.Gotta go.  The Samsung A50 is beeping to let me know I did good yesterday walking or some other attention needing thing.Good luck.', ""I have been needed a new phone for quite some time. I bought a Samsung tab A 10.5 2018 over the summer, and I could not connect it with my phone, because my phone was too, old and did not support the new software. I had a Samsung galaxy note edge, but I didnt want to spend $1000 on a new Note, so the A50 was in my price range, even though it is a mid range phone, it has flagship features. This phone works great on Tmobile, the only problem I had, was that my phone was so old, I didnt have a nano sim card, so I had to go to the Tmobile store and purchase a nano sim for $10. The Tmobile sales rep, put my new sim card and my micro sd card in, then she activated my new sim with my with my old Tmobile number(I'm already a Tmobile customer), and I was on my way in less than 10 minutes. Setting the phone up with the apps and content from my old phone was easy with Samsung Smart Switch. The phone is absolutely stunning and so is the screen quality. The A50 has better screen resolution than all my devices including my new tablet.  So any movies or shows you watch on it in HD, are going to look beautiful! The phone is very intuitive, it basically tells you what you need to do, to get the most out of your apps and how to set it up. It's very fast, fluid and very touch responsive without the lag you might get on a inexpensive phone. So far the photos come out great. I haven't put the camera through all of its paces yet, but once I do, I will upgrade my review. I took a photo at night, and I was impressed with the detail, and color on the photo, the phone's camera as so many features, it's going to take me a good week to play with them all. I'm still setting the phone up, because there are so many features you can play with, and I definitely want to utilize them. I use my phone for work, and  my last phone had a 13mp camera and the photos were good, so with a 25mp camera, I can't wait to take work photos and upload them to the website. I have had $1000 phones before and for $350 this phone still delivers the same premium experience as a flagship phone, with only one drawback the speaker quality isn't that great, but it is doable. I still gave the phone 5 stars because it's only $275-$350, so it's not going to be perfect. The sound quality is fine for watching movies and shows, not so great for listening to music, but I use earphones to listen to music anyway, so it is not a deal breaker for me. Call sound quality is good, so no problems there. I hear alot of people having problems with the fingerprint scanner, I never used it, because I always had problems with them on my other high end Samsung devices, so I stick to a lock pin. You can program you phone to stay unlocked when you are in a trusted place, like home or work or when it is on your body. You can also do face recognition, it's works, but only if you are in a well lit room. Did I mention how beautiful the screen is, or how easy it is to use and navigate, you are going to love this phone!"", 'Most of these reviews throw this phone under the bus for being flawed in some way as being incompatible with certain carriers when simple research would show what networks it is compatible with. I did my homework with this one extensively before purchase and it works great on Straight Talk through AT&T. I went with Straight Talk\'s BYOP plan where you buy a SIM card for $1 and then when you get it in the mail you just transfer your number to the new SIM on their website if you\'re an existing customer, pop the SIM in your new phone et voila! Easy peasy. I had service after I completed the number transfer online, so service really is a non-issue and is kind of unfair to the overall rating of the phone imo. GSM Arena is a great resource to look at prior to making a mobile purchase. Not spon, their site was just really helpful answering the questions I had.I ultimately went with this phone because the A70 is not on the US market yet and most reviews from other sites heralded this phone as the champion of mid-range. I bought this to replace an international unlocked Galaxy J7 that still performs, but does not get Android updates (a serious flaw of international phones as well as Straight Talk, who doesn\'t permit android updates to keep people buying new phones). The J7 feels nicer in my hand as it wider and has more of a bezel and heft to it, but the screen is about an inch smaller top-to-bottom and frankly isn\'t as pretty as the A50. Android 9.0 is a more watered down version compared to what\'s stock in the S10 (I test drove an S10 for a few days) and feels a little confusing. It\'s hard to find certain settings and a lot of the same functionality I had using the S10 and even in my J7 are just...not there. It feels very restricting to not be able to change the appearance of your text messages, etc from the messaging app and instead have to go through your display setting and adjust font size and screen zoom instead. On my J7 I just hit the volume up and down to increase and decrease the text size. It should be that easy on a more expensive phone but it\'s not.Call clarity is on par with the J7 and phones from 4+ years ago. Sounds like a regular old phone. There\'s no HD call quality you\'d get with other phones like the LG Stylo.My biggest gripe with this phone is the one mono speaker. Notifications and audio sound tinny, almost like a blown speaker. As these phones are unlocked by Samsung, they look ""used."" They don\'t look pristine. Everything has been re-packaged and you can tell. I\'m actually worried my phone may have been used and was just wiped and re-sold, so I hope like hell the audio issue isn\'t actually because of a blown speaker. My J7 is mono and sounds a hell of a lot better, much more balanced. The S10 has dual stereo speakers and gets LOUD. Not to say the A50 doesn\'t also get loud (it does), it just sounds....lackluster in comparison. Why my 5 year old phone sounds better than a phone I paid double the price for, I\'ll never know. For that reason, and that reason alone, I docked a star.FWIW I haven\'t had any issues with the fingerprint scanner. It\'s worked every time for me. If it stops, I will update this review accordingly.', ""I was seriously impressed with this phone. Heck I was impressed with the Galaxy A20 that I saw in store. When I researched and found for a few bucks more the Galaxy A50 had significantly better specs, I bought it immediately.And I wasn't disappointed.The screen is phenomenal. It isn't the highest resolution screen in the world, but it's higher resolution than my eyes can notice. So no complaints there. The LED panel makes color rendering fantastic. Visually the screen is stunning.The battery life is just silly. I'm seeing 4 to 5 hours of screen time on a single charge. And the standby time is crazy, with almost no drain whatsoever with the screen off. I'm talking about it going all night with less than 1% drop. I'm not playing games though. This is internet, email, phone calls, etc. Gaming will probably drain it a little faster.The processor is snappy. The whole thing is very responsive. I don't find any lag on it at all. It's a GREAT phone for the price.There are a couple minor things.The camera is just okay. 25MP sounds like high res, but the rendering of an image still has a lot of noise when you zoom in. Any photo it takes looks find on the screen at normal 1x zoom. They look fine when printed on normal sized paper. But you can't zoom in far or print really big and get a high res image. It's good enough for 95% of people who want a simple point and shoot camera handy.The speaker (the media speaker, not the phone speaker) is slightly tinny. It's not crystal clear reproduction of sound.  This really only impacts music. And odds are that you're listening to music on headphones that negates that problem. Pod casts, speakphone calls, etc....it's not bad enough to cause audio problems with that sort of thing. But it's not crystal clear sound reproduction.My biggest complaint about the phone is the lack of notification lights.  The Always On Display is a nice idea in concept (only on an LED phone. On an LCD it's a battery hogging disaster) but its' not nearly customization enough. I like that I can have it show notifications. But I don't like it showing the clock. Even as super dim it's too bright for a dark room. It needs to have an option to only show notification with no clock and then ONLY if you have an active notification.  And why can't it blink so I'd notice a notification from across the room? Just make a small circle that blinks in the middle of the giant LED panel to give notification alerts. Why is that so hard?Anyway those are my 3 complaints about the phone. They aren't deal killers. But they do knock the A50 from 5 stars to 4. I don't see any reason to spend $1000 on the Galaxy S10 though when the A50 is more than enough phone for 90% of people out there. It just does everything you'd want it to do (minus good notifications)"", ""If this were an Android one phone it would be five stars, but Samsung's pointless and sometimes intentionally bad software takes it down a star.First I want to talk about the good things for this phone.The screen is great, it looks great and gets super bright if you need that.The reception so far is good, I get reception in buildings my last phone would sometimes drop connection in.It's quick, if you set it to be. It seems to default to a nice to preserve battery life, which seems kind of silly considering the phone has a large battery, but if you turn off this feature the phone is very quick and smooth. With the battery saver mode it's still good, but someone might get confused thinking the phone is slower than it really is.The battery is 4000mah, which is excellent. If you use your phone a lot during the day this one can handle it.It has a headphone jack and sdcard capability. If you like using headphones with the 3.5mm Jack this phone works.This version (unlocked USA) has ip68 water and dust ratings according to Samsung's website. The international versions you can buy cheaper don't have that.It supports T-Mobile band 71, the international versions don't.It is set to get update support on par with Samsung's flagship phones. Monthly security updates and supposedly at least upgraded to Android 10. We'll see if that hold to that.Now for the minor negatives.The included camera software is terrible. The camera itself isn't great, it captures a fairly noisy image, but with the default camera software you wouldn't know that because it aggressively filters for noise, and then even worse it only saves in a very low quality jpg format. If you get third party camera software like open camera and turn off all of the filtering and set it to save in higher quality you'll see that the camera is actually pretty decent, not flagship level, but much better than the default software makes it look. I'm not sure why Samsung doesn't include some options in the default camera software to allow for less filtering and higher quality files. If you get this phone do yourself a favor and get open camera.The rest of the included extra Samsung version software can also be annoying. If you're like me and you're going to be using Google's apps anyway then having all the extra Samsung versions of everything is just a distraction. Luckily if you're a bit savvy you can use adb to remove or disable almost all the extra Samsung software.Like I said earlier, if this were an Android one phone it would probably be the one to get. As it is is a tough choice between this and the pixel 3a xl. If you know what you're doing you can save some money and get a great phone in this one, but some might not want to make that effort or might want the better camera software included with the pixel. Still for what the unlocked USA a50 costs, is a pretty good piece of hardware."", 'Depending on what you have, and what you\'re looking for, this may be one of the best upgrades you could go for.  Sure, it\'s not a ""Flagship"" phone, however, it comes rather close IMO.128GB of storage?  Far more than the 16GB my old phone had, plenty for me, for now!SD Card Support? WOO!4GB of RAM?  Sweet!  I had to live with 2GB for the last 3 years, almost always at ~100MB free, was painful!I had an AT&T Prepaid cellphone that I got from Walmart several years ago, for me, this was a 100% swap the sim, update everything over wifi, and I was ready to go.  Didn\'t have to mess with any network settings to get LTE, SMS, or anything else.  Media messages come through fine, and calls work fine.The DOWNSIDES!!!  I can\'t FATHOM why Samsung would remove the ability to add backgrounds to messaging, OR remove the messaging widget!  I always used that Widget to get a good idea of what was going on, and to help remind me of texts that might need replied to.  It\'s enough that I am looking for an alternative app.Next downside, no fault of the phone, but the advancement of technology.  I get to replace all my micro-USB chargers, and car charger with Type-C ones, which with the current world affairs, has proven difficult.  But hey, that 4000mAH battery sure as heck lasts me a good 10 hour shift at work, and a 2 hour drive home with Waze running and screen brightness set to auto.BIXBY!!! Or what ever that is called, junk IMO, immediately disabled it to restore my lock/unlock button to its former glory.The last downside, I grew accustomed to being able to change my batteries once they get worn, this one, well, it\'s not serviceable.  But, if it lasts me as long as my previous Samsung phone, or longer, then I will be well pleased.So, should you get it?  Sure, if you are looking to upgrade from a lower end, older phone.  But if you have a flagship phone from the last few years, it\'s probably not worth the current market value as of writing this.']"

The specs are on par with the Galaxy S series at half or over half the cost depending on S10 version.  I opted for the white one because of the specs listed for the bands it can use.  I know it should not matter what the color is on the outside, but the black and blue A70s did not list as many bands as usable.  That was not just on the listing here, but other places I searched.  I didn\'t want to take a chance of getting one that may or may not work on AT&T in this area so got the one I knew would.Pros:  It came with a clear soft case/cover and an SD card. The call quality is great on both ends through my AT&T service.  It has a battery larger than the ones in other Samsung S series phones I\'ve had so it has no problem lasting all day.  If I were to somehow wear the battery down before the end of the day I don\'t see where it would be a problem because it is VERY fast charging.  I have also forgotten to charge it overnight a couple of times and still had enough to run through the second day without a boost.  No it does not ""share"" power to other devices as the S10 series, but I was not looking for that option anyway.  The screen is very bright and ""flat"" (THANK YOU).  I never was a fan of the ""edge"" screen on the S series but Samsung never gave an option for them with a flat surface instead of the edge screen.  That actually was part of the reason I pulled the trigger on this model.  I haven\'t had any more problems seeing it in bright sunny areas than any other phone I\'ve ever had and don\'t have to deal with the annoying edge that could at times glare when the reset of the screen did not. The speaker when playing music or videos is what you would expect from a phone if you are realistic; I\'ve never heard a phone that sounded better or even close to the old HTC Mate with 2 front facing speakers.  This A70 has a single downward firing speaker like 99.9% of all others.  It has an option to turn on Dolby Atmos if you plug in headphones but I have not tried that so cannot comment beyond the fact the option is there.  The same it true with NFC (have not tried it).  It is not an option on many ""economy"" phones but is on the A70 if that was a concern for you.Con:  Not sure it is a ""con"", but it is not a ""pro"" -- the in screen finger print reader.  When I first started using this phone I would sometimes just give up and swipe the screen to enter my PIN to unlock.  I have since found that it will not always recognize your print if you have dirt on your finger (or screen) and are not in exactly the right spot for the full print.  I\'m not sure if this has anything to do with the screen protector I put on it so it could be in part my fault. At any rate, I have now gotten used to it and know my finger has to be totally clean and I know exactly where and what position it needs to be placed on the screen.  It still have to try 2 or 3 times on occasion even after that, but again could be the protector I put on it so I did not remove any stars for it.Overall I highly recommend this phone to any budget minded shoppers looking for a great phone at a reasonable price for a very high end mid-level device that performs like a top tier flagship.', ""This is going to be a review that highlights a few stand-out points (good and bad).  There are plenty of more detailed tech reviews out there so be my guest.  I purchased this for a family member but i used it for a while before passing it on.What I LOVED1) price tag / value position.  When you find this phone at around sub 400$ mark,  you really  do appreciate this phone.2) really decent screen / size.  It's massive but it still holds OK one handed because its not that heavy.  the screen is bright and ultra bright enough for outdoor use.  despite what other reviews say, i think this screen is sufficient3) its a mid-teir chipset  but actually , for one who doesnt play games much, this is not sluggish at all.  8g ram helps.  love the massive flash capacity of 128gb too --- it kind of makes up for samsung's bloatware.  Most of it is not used ---> install all google apps and disable the rest.4) camera performance is  not as good as a pixel2/3 in low light. but it is still quite good.  The extra wide lens is handy for some situations which pixel phones cannot offer.  i'm really impressed with how quick the shooting lag is.  it focuses and takes the shot instantly , similar performance as pixel2/3 performance imo.  i'm often annoyed by mid-teir phones that have a slightly longer lag between pressing the shoot button and actual picture capture (moto, sony...) but this mid teir spec phone has none of that.  the camera app is much more richly featured than a simple pixel camera but  in my honest opinion, these are all  gimmicks.  it takes good shots and it takes it quickly.  thats really all i can ask for for mid tear phone.5) micro SD card slot and DUALSIM capable.  This is a  nice bonus for me.  this device already has a generous amount of flash but having that extra SD card slot helps alleviate the storage needs (i route all camera pics to the card whilst keeping internal flash for apps).  DUALSIM is actually useful for me because the user of the phone travels to asia annually and its a nice feature to slot in a local sim during travels.What I wish were better1) finger print sensor  --- many reviews reported it doesnt work well under the screen.  I found this very weird.  It seems to work PERFECT with my thumb but with another person's thumb, it doesnt work AT ALL (???)  I had to resort to face recognition for now until i figure this one out2) samsung bloat -- theres a tonne of bloat on samsung phones.  i ended up disabling a lot of it especially the launcher.  i dont love it at all.  you cant really remove the software since it's baked into the firmware but the 128gb flash makes up for that.  a typical pixel phone comes with 64 gb.... if samsung phones came with just 64GB, you'd have little left for your own apps/data :)  but thank goodness there is 128.3) heat.  this phone heats up quick  and its warmer than other devices i've used.  I'm not sure why but it is noticeable.so what other options are there?  well there is samsung A50 too  (at the time of writing, the A51 and A71 are the most current A-series phones but theyre just priced too high).  If i'm going to be totally honest here,  i think if you can find a pixel2XL with 128gb flash, at under 400$, then you are better off with that especially because of the camera performance.  I'm going to recommend this device if you really need the extra wide lens, the SD card, and nicer larger screen real estate."", ""Don't use the print with wet hands."", ""I got this phone and unfortunately wasn't able to take good pictures since my old phone was very bad and dying. But overall the phone is really great!It came with an SD card I believe it to be 128GB. Which is very nice. A phone case. The fast charging charger. And headphones.I was a bit disappointed since the phone came in a tad bit late, and I wanted to go to work with my new phone, as well as not charged, and dead out of box. I took points off that a bit. But I can understand not all phones come fully charged.After charging halfway I was able to go to work right after trying to set things up and the phone wasn't dying much at all still lost a bit of battery though.Fast charge goes work wonders for someone who had not had a new smart phone for 5-6 years.After a few more days of finally being able to sit down an set things up because of work I was able to play around with the phone.I found that the phone isn't really good at battery, which I'm not really surprised with due to researching the phone. I charged up the phone to 100% and was only able to play a game for 10 mintues to 30 mintues before it started going down. By 30 mintues it was around 97% and about 3-4 hours it's around 80 which I'm not too impressed with. And a little upset about. Even with apps on sleep and power settings on and other custom battery saving options it still goes down no matter what I use. So I'm a bit upset for that. And marked points for battery again.My games barely use anything as it's just a regular visual  novel or candy crush like games. So it shouldn't make sense that my battery goes down so fast.The fingerprint options I'm not too fond of and find myself having to reset my fingerprints all over again.The pictures aren't that great. But it is great during daytime.I was on a budget and can't complain about camera and battery. But overall this phone is wonders if your looking for just a new phone and space with a small income. Especially upgrading to a newer phone as I did.If you don't use apps as much as me, I'm sure your battery will be better than mine. But I'm not sure if it was because the phone's battery itself.If you have t-mobile I'm sure you would be okay using your SIN. I did that and everything seems to work just fine."", 'The short review- Buy this phone. The long review- Read on.Wow. That was my first impression when I transferred my files over and starting using this phone. But first, a little background before we dive into the review. I\'ve had an iPhone for several years now. I\'ve even tried different android phones over the years to (Motorola, Xhaomi, Huawei). But nothing came close the polished well-designed experience you get from Apple, until now.The UI:To me, the Android UI has always felt a little rough around the edges when comparing it to the refined design of IOS. I heard Touchwiz was a bit of a cluster, so I avoided it; but Samsung\'s new OneUI has a very intuitive, well-thought-out design that easily rivals that of IOS.The Screen:Amazing! I can see why Samsung is the exclusive display supplier for Apple\'s  X line of phones (X, XR, XS, XS Max) Apple\'s marketing team calls it a ""Liquid Retina Display"" but the rest of us call it an FHD+ Super AMOLED display. It doesn\'t quite roll off the tongue like Apple\'s name, but the display is gorgeous.The Specs:The  Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 Octa-Core processor, 6GB of RAM, 128 GB ROM, AND an additional 128GB Micro SD card included in the box, make this a powerful combo. I\'m not a mobile gamer, but the operation for all other media consumption is fast and smooth.The camera(s) 32.0 MP + 5.0 MP + 8.0 MP provide great detail easily rivaling or exceeding that of my iPhone 7, and on the front...a 32MP selfie camera!Audio- I purchased a pair of Anker Soundcore Bluetooth earbuds back when was using an iPhone; the sound quality was OK and you definitely needed to EQ your music when using them but now that I\'m using them with the A70 and the Dolby Atmos processing, music, movies, and podcasts sound so much better! (non-technical exaggeration here) like 80% better!Size- It\'s a big one! about as wide as my iPhone 7Plus but taller, this makes it much easier to hold; and for the most part, you\'re in two-handed usage territory here anyway. NOT a phone for skinny jeans wearing folk.The ONLY Downside so far- The in-screen fingerprint reader. There I said it, It takes about 1 full second for the in-screen fingerprint reader to validate and open the phone IF it recognizes you (I\'m sure a software update could fix this) but my work-around has been to register my fingerprint twice to make authentication a little smoother.  My suggestion? Just use face unlock if it\'s too slow for you.Additional recommendations: Anker Soundcore Bluetooth Earbuds, and the SunRemex Carbon Fiber Designed Galaxy A70 Case, a perfect combination IMHO.That\'s it for now- I\'ll report back in about a month to add if anything changes.Cheers!', ""This phone has proven to me that cheap phones are nearly as good as the flagships. The only feature I miss is waterproofing. But seriously this phone has everything. The underscreen fingerprint reader can be finicky at times, but still works most of the time. Never going back to flagships, especially since they eclipsed $1000. And yes, it works perfectly in the US. I was worried it wouldn't, since it says international, but it works great, I'm on T-mobile also, so mileage may vary for Verizon or sprint users. Also, 128gb internal on a phone that's $300??? I'm just so impressed.Pros:-Strong enough to play any game I've thrown at it, (*cough* dolphin works fairly well too, astonishingly, all emulation below that power wise works flawlessly)-Amoled screen, in a freaking budget phone-128gb internal with expandable storage!-Works in the US on GSM-Wide angle lens, that's fairly good.-Pretty good speakers-Underscreen Fingerprint reader-Near bezelless display, (the tear drop camera doesn't bother me, and I forget it's there.)-INCREDIBLE BATTERY LIFE. I seriously cant kill this thing in a day of heavy use. Playing games all day while recovering after getting my wisdom teeth removed was the lowest it's gotten, to around 8%. But then...-Suuuuper fast charging! I plug it in, and within half an hour I could use it for another day.-Platic back that doesnt look plastic, so if something does come up with the battery like my old flagship, I can just easily remove the back and replace it, it doesnt pop off, you still need the heat and stuff, but it wont shatter like glass when you try to remove it.-Headphone JackCons:-Camera is so-so. It's great in outdoors pictures. But definitely shows its midrange price if you dont have the flash on. You also can't take the highest resolution settings and have the flash on, it at most can be auto.-Fingerprint reader doesnt always work. I'd say 1/10th of the time it doesnt read on the first try. And 1/30th of the time I just have to type in my passcode. I do have a glass screen protector on (registered thumb after putting it on though), so maybe that's the problem.If you're reading reviews and considering a phone, this is the one to get. Price is fantastic. Battery is astounding. Screen is vivid and bright. Can play fairly intensive games at max settings. AND IS $300 DOLLARS. This is the phone to buy!"", ""So far this phone is great, especially for the $300+ (The cost when I purchased it) it cost. I was looking into the A50 but after doing research I felt comfortable spending the additional money on the A70 and I don't regret it. The battery life is really good, especially at first, but as with every phone over time it uses up the batter faster the longer it's owned and used. However, since I use my phone almost all day long, I really only recharge it once, but most of the time if I'm at my desk I'll just keep it on charge because I can. The camera is good, I've noticed the the quality of the picture looks better before you hit the button to take the photo, but it's not a huge difference. Lighting does impact the quality of the photo a good amount as well, so sometimes trying to get the best lighting is a challenge but normal sunlight is the best option for lighting. Sound is great, picture/video quality is great. I have not noticed any lag with transitions or opening and closing apps like I have in previous phones.The main downside I have for this phone is that it uses a Type C USB charging cord which is different from the previous samsung charging cords, but it's not a big deal. It just requires you having to buy a different charging cord if you want more than the one it comes with. The phone is a pretty big fit in the hand so it may take some getting used to with being held. The screen protector that comes with the phone works great. I have yet to take it off. However, I doubt that it would stop any cracks or screen damages from occurring if one is known to drop or hit their phone. I'm not, I like to take care of the things I have. I have not used the finger print scanner or face recognition thing nor do I plan on using them so I have no idea how well they work."", 'Was skeptical about purchasing this phone because its the international version and the US doesnt carry this phone and supposedly it worked for tmobile in the US. I did a lot of research on the frequency compatibility with my network and supposedly I only had 1 freq out of 5 available and that was 850MHz so obviously I was a little apprehensive about it, but not anymore!PROS- Android Pie 9.0 update right out of the box!- AMOLED screen looks just as good as my previous phone the Galaxy S8+!- Web browsing and downloading is extremely fast, even with 10+ apps running at the same time!- Gaming is very smooth, can play PUBG with no issues whatsoever.- Battery life is the BEST. It\'ll last all day with 4500 mah!- Fast charging! I get to around 40% in about 30 minutes.- The white plastic back cover looks awesome and feels like premium in your hand!CON (it can be fixed for the most part)- The camera.It doesn\'t have video stabilization so if you move your hand a bit, it moves the camera more than you\'d think it would when you watch it again. Although every task that Samsung says it does, it does but don\'t be fooled by reading the ""32 mega pixel primary cam"" the 32 pixels you get are software pixels not hardware from the camera itself. Selfie pics are a little too soft and you\'ll look a little washed out unless you\'re closer to the camera than the normal selfie. BUT it can fixed! Well about 85% better than stock. Download the app \'One S10 camera\' it\'s almost the same layout camera as the REAL Galaxy S series cam and has a more premium layout than what is already installed. It improves the quality of each pic in every way possible! It cleans up the lines and gives much better details over all, as well as the selfie pics are much better and night pics are really good, it even makes the color black a lot deeper too but in all the right places. It\'s rated a 4.6 stars in the android app store so you know it\'s good!Overall it\'s an amazing phone at an even better price! This is the FLAGSHIP of top end, mid tier phones and being that barely anyone has it in the US makes it even better.BTW my phone is a A705MN model.', ""I've had this phone for a few months now, and like it quite a bit.Quick review:Overall very fast, efficient, and great battery and very fast charging. Great storage capacity and can use a Micro SD for even more. Meh camera, good screen, the display is AMOLED which is a plus. Great for multitasking, videos, and works good with basically any games too. 8/10?Detailed review:Great bang for your buck. I really enjoy this phone. The best parts are mainly the speed, RAM, storage size, and the battery life/charge speed. The drawbacks, if any, is the camera, and screen durability from scratching. It's clarity also isn't perfect, though it definitely looks fine overall. The camera is alright, definitely not super high resolution, though it does have a nice wide-angle lens option which is useful when you don't have a lot of distance from something but want to photograph as much as possible. However, the phone is always quick, and basically never stutters the way I use it, meaning you can multitask easy and not have to close apps often, if at all. The screen is also big so you can utilize the split screen and other multitasking features without sacrificing too much screen space. The charge rate is super fast, and the speed the battery declines is quite slow. You could charge it for an hour and have power in it for several more, and I never even use the battery saving functions. As for ways to unlock, it has facial recognition and a fingerprint scanner, though I have not tried the facial recognition due to lack of interest. The fingerprint scanner however I have used since the day I got it. It's a useful feature."", ""Le telephone a tout pour que je l aime.Il est gros et bleu.J'aime son esthétique.Mais quand je viens pour texter j essaie d envoyer et ca clik pas.Il a fallu que je le ferme et l ouvrir pour que cela fonctionne.Plusieurs reprises qu il a fallu que je ferme l appareil et que je l ouvre pour pouvoir cliker sur les touches pour que cela fonctionne.Avant sur mon s9 on pouvait voir en haut a gauche de l ecran le pourcentage de la batterie maintenant il y a juste un petit signe de batterie mais pas le pourcentage on doit aller dans les parametre pour aller voir le pourcentage.Jusqu a maintenant il y a ca qui fonctionne pas bien j attend ca ne fait pas longtemps que j ai recu le telephone.Mais en gros c est bien""]"

Google support were not helpful - they said they wouldn't offer normal warranty on this item, because the IMEI showed it's a demo phone that has been resold after being used for demonstrations in stores. This was a red flag for me, as the Amazon listing doesn't mention that anywhere, and if I were to go by the information in the original box, I'd expect it to be covered. I'd suggest to the seller that they update the listing to make it clear they are selling demo phones, if that is the case.

Smartphone , caricabatteria da muro da 30W , cavo USB Type C 2.0 , cover e manualistica varia . Fortunatamente Oneplus ha pensato bene di pre-applicare sul bel display una pellicola 3D di buona fattura e ti ottima trasparenza con trattamento oleofobico dignitoso .Estratto dalla confezione il 7 Pro appare in tutta la sua maestosa importanza . Il display da 6,7 pollici occupa oltre il 93% della superficie dello smartphone con cornici sottili e ottimizzate al meglio su tre lati mentre sul lato inferiore del Chin (Mento) concede un filo di spazio in più alla cornice per consentire l\'inserimento dell\'Amoled e relativa piegatura flat cable . Nulla di visivamente sconcertante ma la differenza seppur minima rispetto agli altri lati c\'è e va segnalata .Rispetto ad altri smartphone TOP risulta meno invadente o comunque in linea con la diretta concorrenza .Interamente realizzato in Vetro Gorilla Glass 5 della Corning assume la caratteristica configurazione 3D sia nella parte frontale dove la curvatura dei bordi risulta più evidente , sia nella parte posteriore con un curva più dolce che asseconda la presa con il palmo della mano .Il tutto incorniciato da un sottile ed elegante frame di metallo .Display frontale privo di Notch ( finalmente un Display senza fori , notch e gocce ) . Parte posteriore con le tre fotocamere e il doppio Flash led quasi a filo e poco sporgenti ( forse 1 mm) allineate centralmente lungo l\'asse longitudinale ( grazie OnePlus) .Bilanciere del volume sul lato sx , tasto accensione ed il classico tasto slide di selezione modalità (Suoneria – Vibrazione – Silenzioso) posti sulla dx in sequenza con il tasto di selezione modalità zigrinato per riconoscerlo immediatamente senza dover sbirciare in continuazione il lato frame .Al momento Amazon distribuisce solo la colorazione Mirror Gray nella configurazione 8Gb RAM 256 Gb ROM .Colore che seppur non innovativo risulta all\'atto pratico molto elegante e con dei riflessi tono su tono a me decisamente graditi . Trattamento oleofobico posteriore quasi a livello degli Oppo Reno . Scivolosità dello smartphone drammaticamente alta .Bisogna prestare mota attenzione se non si vuole utilizzare la cover in dotazione . Rispetto al Case omaggiato da OnePlus sarebbe meglio una cover in silicone con i Bumper sugli spigoli . Ne ho presa una sempre su Amazon che non aumenta lo spessore del 7 Pro se non per integrare a filo le camere posteriori ma quantomeno offre un minimo di protezione soprattutto sugli spigoli .Dopo questa nota introduttiva iniziamo  la recensione particolareggiata  dal Display Amoled ( 1+ lo definisce Fluid Amoled) ovvero un gigantesco 6,7 pollici ( precisamente 6,67) con una risoluzione massima QHD+ che rende il Display del 1+ 7 Pro ( a mio modesto parere ) il miglior Display per Android di questo 2019 , con una risoluzione di ben 560 DPI in QHD+ e 420 DPI in FHD+.Se la batte ad armi pari con i migliori Amoled Samsung (S10/S10+) ed in alcune circostanze li supera grazie alla visibilità 100% senza interruzioni della visione dovute a fori o notch .Una vera e propria meraviglia che vince a mani basse nei confronti con i Display dei vari P30/P30Pro ed ancor di più con gli Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 e Mi 9 .All\'atto pratico la differenza fra le due risoluzioni (QHD+ o FHD+) si nota tutta ed anche in maniera vistosa .Grazie anche al Refresh da 90 Hz la visione dei contenuti in QHD+ risulta piacevolissima , nitidezza , contrasti con una profondità dei colori e del nero tali da rappresentare un vero e proprio punto di riferimento su cui basare tutti i futuri confronti con altre realizzazioni .Niente paura per quanto riguarda le modalità d\'uso del 7Pro , tramite impostazioni del display si potrà scegliere il refresh a 90 o 60 Hz oppure la risoluzione QHD+ o FHD+ … presente anche una regolazione software automatica che ne ottimizza le prestazioni secondo l\'utilizzo al momento .Nell\'insieme il 1+ 7 pro risulta abbastanza grande e probabilmente scomodo nell\'utilizzo con una mano . Il peso di ben 206 grammi non aiuta dal punto di vista ergonomico e della maneggevolezza ma godere di un Display simile e quindi poter visionare contenuti puliti e full-immersion fanno dimenticare e passare in secondo piano determinate caratteristiche legate alle misure e peso prettamente fisiche .E\' un bel padellone per cui se avete mani piccole o siete amanti degli smartphone compatti ( vedi MI9Se o P30) lasciate perdere questa meraviglia e date un\'occhiata alla concorrenza che propone comunque smartphone compact più che interessanti .Sorvolo sull\'Hardware che ben sappiamo OnePlus ha affidato alla CPU Snapdragon 855 ed alla GPU Adreno 640 . Un connubio scontato ma allo stesso tempo una garanzia per chi ama utilizzare lo smartphone anche per il gaming ( è presente un settaggio software Turbo che unito al refresh da 90Hz rappresenta una vera goduria per gli amanti del gaming ai massimi livelli ) .Effettuato test AnTuTu sia con risoluzione QHD+ che FHD+ … i risultati (per quel che possono valere ) si attestano fra i 364.000 ed i 367.000 punti che posizionano il 7 Pro al terzo posto del Ranking subito dopo l\'inossidabile MI 9 ed il Black Shark . ( Per la precisione avendo provato anche il nuovo Asus Zenfone 6 ancora non ufficialmente in classifica AnTuTu il 7Pro si posizionerebbe al quarto posto ) .Il modello da me recensito possiede 8Gb di Ram e ben 256 Gb di velocissima memoria UFS 3.0 che vanno a completare la sezione Hardware primaria .Ricezione ed Audio.Ricezione veramente al TOP , in nessun caso ho avuto problemi di ricezione sia per chiamate che per navigazione web . Anche nelle posizioni di riferimento dove altri smartphone hanno mstrato qualche problema di segnale ballerino il 7 Pro ha mantenuto una ricezione del segnale ( sia Vodafone – HO – 3 ed addirittura Fastweb) senza problemi … anche minimi .Ricezione in capsula eccellente - Viva Voce con volume alto e bello corposo , mai metallico e robotico .Finalmente ( Alleluiah ) è presente l\'audio stereo ben bilanciato fra l\'altoparlante inferiore e capsula auricolare . Rispetto ad altri Smartphone con audio stereo Oneplus ha restituito un audio praticamente sovrapponibile fra Microfono e Capsula Auricolare . Buona presenza delle fq basse e ottima nitidezza . Una vera goduria soprattutto per il Gaming .Non sono presenti moduli IRDA o uscite jack cuffie ( bisogna utilizzare la USB Type C ) .Presenti ad occhio ben tre microfoni per l\'ottimizzazione della ricezione e soppressione rumori di fondo .(Non ne sono sicuro al 100% ma sembra sia questa la filosofia di pulizia suono della OnePlus …. nel caso avessi commesso qualche errore chiedo venia in quanto 3 gg scarsi sono relativamente pochi per scoprire tutte le future e particolarità di uno smartphone) )I comporto sicurezza contempla il posizionamento del lettore d\'impronta posto sotto lo schermo ed il riconoscimento facciale tramite l\'altra novità ovvero la camera frontale PoP Up che potranno essere utilizzate a piacimento sia indipendentemente che assieme .Consiglio l\'utilizzo del lettore impronte sotto schermo , veloce ed affidabile oltre ad essere più sicuro . Sono presenti ulteriori sistema di sicurezza come inserimento PIN o sequenza grafica .FotocameraHo letto a dx e sx che la fotocamera del OnePlus 7 Pro potrebbe rappresentare uno dei lati deboli di questo smartphone .C\'è chi dice che non è presente la Grandangolare ( errato visto che ci sono ben tre sensori  di cui  uno dedicato alla funzione Wide seppur non esasperata come in altri smartphone  ) . Che non è presente la stabilizzazione ottica ed elettronica ( falso è presente in contemporanea limitatamente al sensore principale da 48mp da 0,8nM- o 4x1 1,6 nM Sony IMX586 f. 1,7 – solo OIS sul sensore Tele da 8Mp apertura 2.4- Assente solo sulla grandangolare (???) da 16Mp con apertura 2.2 ed angolo di ben 117°) .Zoom Ottico 1 a 3 X – Digitale fino a 10X .Fotocamera Frontale Sony IMX471 fuoco fisso apertura 2.0  Pop UP  ( la  soluzione del momento per avere un display  senza notch o fori )  con  una ottima resa  e Bokeh scontornato ottimamente  senzA mostrare  lati invasivi nella sfocatura .  Una ottima fotocamera  con dettagli di primissimo livello.Comparto Video  4k -  30 e 60 fps  che consentono  riprese di ottimo livello  , ovviamente stabilizzate  con colori realistici ed audio  eccellente . I  video risultano  fluidi e  non tremolanti con colori  naturali e quasi  totalmente privi di scatti  e perdita di frame .Nel complesso il comparto Foto - Video è un  un vero e proprio  balzo in avanti da pare di OnePlus rispetto ai predecessori  OnePlus 6 e 6T .C\'è da affinare alcune gestioni software  ( il OnePlus 7 Pro  ha ricevuto  alla prima accensione  un nuovo aggiornamento firmware  relativo alla gestione  Camera  che ha migliorato  stabilità e AI ) . Rimangono i soliti problemi  per gli scatti  notturni  che rappresentano  un vero e proprio  spauracchio di qualsiasi smartphone  TOP gamma .Anche il P30 pro seppur sicuramente  una spanna migliore  del OnePlus 7 Pro  non è che mi abbia convinto al 100%.Quel che si apprezza del complesso Camera è la resa dei colori  molto naturale , la buona gestione dell\'AI mai troppo invasiva , le ottime riprese Video , l\'ottima camera  anteriore PopUp.Dopo tutti questi dati che rappresentano solo valori numerici ma che danno l\'idea della tecnologia impiegata all\'atto pratico ho riscontrato una realizzazione fotografica da Top gamma a tutti gli effetti . Sicuramente non ai livelli del P30 pro ma equilibrata e con una resa cromatica decisamente naturale e godibile . Ottimo il comportamento nell\'ingrandimento delle foto scaricate su PC che reggono senza alcun problema ingrandimenti paragonabili alle migliori fotocamere digitali Bridge o Mirror Lens ed alcune Reflex .Se proprio vogliamo trovare il pelo nell\'uovo forse una certa lentezza nella messa a fuoco che non si può considerare fulminea soprattutto su oggetti contrastati o riflettenti per il resto decidete voi dalle foto inserite in recensione .Software di gestione semplice e basico . (Solo 4 modalità in primo piano )Video – Foto – Ritratto- UltraNight …. per le altre modalità bisogna entrare nel menù a tendina -Piacevole la scelta di utilizzare la regolazione del tele o grandangolo tramite un menù a carosello che consente con semplici movimenti di passare da 0,6 fino a 10 X .Buono se non ottimo lo scontorno dei selfie , l\'effetto sfocatura Bokeh risulta essere ben controllato e non eccessivamente invasivo .ConnessioniSono presenti tutte le possibilità di connettività immaginabili – Bluetooth 5.0 – WIFI 2X 2,4-5,0 Ghz- NFC - GPS preciso e stabile ( nella prova effettuata aggancia fino a 42 satelliti su 50 con una precisione di posizionamento inferiore ai 2 mt ) - Intelligente la soluzione proposta da OnePlus di marcare il posizionamento della vettura parcheggiata tramite GPS e Foto . Questa peculiarità ci permette di rintracciare l\'auto in qualsiasi momento tramite l\'utilizzo di Google Maps anche nelle situazioni più caotiche ed in posteggi megagalattici .Presenti tutte le bande di connessione compresa la famigerata banda 20 .Connessione LTE 4G+Gestione SIM dual sia per la navigazione che per le chiamate -Compatibilità Android AUTO accertata sulla mia Suzuki Vitara , basta ricordarsi di selezionare una SIM prestabilita per le chiamate e navigazione altrimenti alcune funzioni abortiranno senza prova d\'appello .Il sistema operativo Andoid PIE è caratterizzato dalla personalizzazione OxygenOS OnePlustanto amata ed apprezzata da chi ama soluzioni poco invasive molto simili e vicine ad Android Stock .Autonomia e RicaricaL\'accumulatore di questo OnePlus 7 Pro è un ottimo accumulatore da ben 4000mA che potrebbero essere più che sufficienti per raggiungere senza problemi la tarda serata .Solo nel caso di selezione fissa in QHD + e largo utilizzo Gaming potrebbe essere necessaria una ricarica prima di andare a coricarsi .Fortunatamente OnePlus ha previsto la funzione super Charge Wrap tramite alimentatore in dotazione da ben 30 W che consentono una ricarica del 70% in soli 20 minuti ed una ricarica completa in circa 40/45 minuti .Personalmente con un utilizzo medio - intenso arrivo a fine serata ( 10,30/11,00) con un buon 20 % di carica residua .Impossibile prendere due giorni pieni se non limitando il Refresh a 60 Hz e la risoluzione in FHD+ unitamente ad un utilizzo blando e limitato a qualche telefonata , escursioni saltuarie sui social e web , utilizzo della messaggistica limitato .Giudizio finale .Dopo aver provato ed ( ahimè) acquistato da inizio anno MI MIX 3 – MI 9 – Oppo Reno – Asus ZenFone 6 - Samsung S10 – Huawei P30Pro e P30 posso quantomeno fornire una mia considerazione personale basata su prove reali e non sul sentito dire o su letture estemporanee.Quelli citati tutti ottimi smartphone con peculiarità e caratteristiche che determinano le scelte ed indirizzo dell\'utente finale .Se degli Xiaomi ho apprezzato la compattezza , velocità , prezzi contenuti ed un ottico comportamento generale non altrettanto posso affermare sul lato autonomia e comparto fotografico .Samsung ( non è il mio Brand preferito ) ottimi in tutti i comparti ma con il quid dell\'autonomia e del costo non sempre allineato con prodotti simili .Huawei P30Pro e P30 potrebbero essere una vera alternativa al OnePlus 7 Pro ma con l\'ansia del ban Google che ne sta limitando considerevolmente le vendite ed il futuro .Gli OPPO ( Fratelli di OnePlus) possono rappresentare una valida alternativa se non si punta ad un Hardware TOP … tutto il resto è Ok , prezzo compreso .Grande sorpresa l\'Asus Zenfone 6 che consiglierei ad occhi chiusi per Hardware , Accumulatore da 5000 mA dalla autonomia infinita e Flip Camera rivoluzionaria ma che pecca terribilmente con il Display Led a mio parere un po\' sottotono rispetto alla concorrenza . ( Con un Amoled lo avrei inserito fra le prime scelte in assoluto ) .Ebbene OnePlus ha sfornato un prodotto che dovrebbe mettere d\'accordo tutti quanti . Hardware di primissimo livello , miglior Display presente sul mercato ( Top Samsung esclusi ) , comparto fotografico eccellente , garanzie di supporto ed aggiornamenti che la OnePlus ci ha abituato ad apprezzare nel corso di questi ultimi due anni , schermo full immersion , ricarica rapidissima ed accumulatore da ben 4000 mA , personalizzazione OxygenOS OnePlus che è sicuramente la migliore presente sul mercato …. insomma tanti fattori che collegati e presi nella dovuta considerazione mi fanno propendere per considerare il 7 Pro il miglior Smartphone attualmente in commercio …. per altro ad un prezzo tutto sommato congruo e conveniente', ""Ich möchte euch gerne mit meiner kleinen Rezession einen Einblick in die Nutzung des Oneplus 7 Pro's geben.Fangen wir mit dem Highlight an, dem Display:Das Display ist, und das lässt sich nicht abstreiten, das beste was ich bisher auf einem mobilen Gerät gesehen habe. Es ist gestochen scharf, bietet schöne natürliche und zugleich kräftige Farben und hat einen Weißwert, den ich noch nie bei einem Android-Device gesehen habe. Die 90 Hertz sind ganz klar ein Schritt in die richtige Richtung.Ich muss zugeben, dass ich mir von den 90 Hertz mehr erwartet habe (Als ich damals von 60 Hertz auf einen 144 Hertz Monitor umgestiegen bin, waren das Welten). Klar man sieht es auf jeden Fall wenn man drauf achtet, aber ganz ehrlich, in der täglichen Nutzung fiel es gar nicht so viel ins Gewicht.Von mir gibt es daher 5 von 5 Fingerabdruckscanner(Der im Display versteckte Fingerabdrucksensor der OP 7 Pro ist übrigens erste Sahne. Ich habe noch keinen schnelleren in diversen von mir getesteten Geräten gefunden.)Kommen wir zum Lautsprecher:Der Lautsprecher ist richtig schön laut und bietet, warscheinlich auch wegen der Größe, einen sehr tollen Stereo Effekt. Der Klang ist klar und kräftig, allerdings hätte ich mir etwas mehr Tiefgang erwartet. Da bietet das Galaxy S10+ auf jeden Fall den runderen Klang. Der Lautsprecher spielt aber ziemlich weit oben mit und ich verstehe die Kritik, die ich teilweise gelesen habe nicht wirklich.Was mich allerdings etwas gestört hat, ist das die Lautstärke in gefühlt 50 Stufen regelbar ist. Das kann zwar ein Vorteil sein, aber für mich war es ziemlich umständlich das Handy zB. wieder leise zu bekommen, nachdem es auf voller Lautstärke war. Man kann die Wippe allerdings gedrückt halten und die Lautstärke schnell verstellen. Leider ist dies nicht so präzise, wie das anklicken.Für den Lautsprecher gibt es von mir 4 von 5 Klinkensteckern(Diesen hat das Oneplus 7 Pro übrigens nicht und es wird auch kein Adapter dafür beigelegt -> Schade!)Die Leistung / Performance:Keine Frage, das Oneplus 7 Pro ist aktuell die Speerspitze, was die Performance angeht. Es läuft Pfeilschnell und läst eigentlich keinerlei Verzögerungen zu. Es macht richtig Spaß das Handy zu benutzen und das 90 Hertz Display sorgt dafür, dass sich das Handy noch schneller anfühlt als ein Vergleichbares S10+ oder Iphone XS Max.Ich habe es nicht geschafft, das Handy an seine Grenzen zu bringen.Für die Leistung gibt es von mir 5 von 5 QI Ladegeräten(Funfact: Oneplus hat es leider immernoch nicht geschafft einen QI Empfänger für kabelloses Laden zu verbauen. Viele andere Flagschiffe bieten dieses Feature. Ich persönlich nutze es nicht. - Dennoch Schade!)Kamera:Fassen wir es kurz, die Kamera ist auf einem guten Level und im Alltag brauchbar. Allerdings fühlen sich die Sensoren eher nach gehobener Mittelklasse an. Ich hatte schon sehr viele Mobile Geräte und das Oneplus ist in Punkto Kamera einfach etwas hinter der Konkurrenz. Gerade beim Weitwinkelsensor, welchen ich eigentlich sehr gerne nutze, muss man Abstriche machen. Da hat zum Beispiel das LG G6 aus dem Jahr 2017 die bessere Weitwinkelkamera gehabt.Wem die Kamera sehr wichtig ist, sollte sich leider nicht gerade das OP 7 Pro zulegen. Mir fehlt einfach ein wenig die Schärfe und der Weißabgleich wird nicht wirklich oft richtig getroffen.Von mir gibts für die Kamera leider nur gute 3,5 von 5 IP-Zertifizierungen(Diese hat das Oneplus leider auch nicht. Es soll zwar Wasserdicht sein, aber OP entschied sich dagegen das Handy zertifizieren zu lassen. Hierzu kann man geteilter Meinung sein.)Akku:Der nächste für mich sogar sehr wichtige Punkt ist die Akkulaufzeit des OP 7 Pro's.Was soll ich sagen, ich war Anfangs echt skeptisch ob das OP7 mit seinem 4000 MaH Akku im WQHD und 90 Hertz betrieb genügend Saft für einen Tag bieten kann.Hierzu sei gesagt, dass ich vom Akku echt überrascht bin. Ich kam bei ausgiebiger Nutzung immer auf etwa 6 Stunden Bildschirm an Zeit. Dies ist meiner Meinung nach ein wirklich guter Wert mit dem man auf jeden Fall locker über den Tag kommen sollte. Für zwei Tage reicht es für Vielnutzer allerdings leider nicht.Klar könnte man den Bildschirm auch auf 60 Hertz bei Full HD Auflösung stellen. Aber im Ernst, ich kaufe mir doch kein Flagship um dann alles runter zu schrauben.Der Akku bekommt von mir 4,5 von 5 Schutzfolien(Von Werk aus, ist auf dem OP 7 Pro schon eine Schutzfolie aufgebracht - Sehr löblich !)Sonstiges:- Oxygen OS ist ein wirklich sehr angenehmes Betriebssystem. Es bietet sehr sinnvolle Optionen und ist dennoch sehr nah am Stock Android angelehnt. Von mir gibts dafür wirklich ein Plus!- Der Notificationslider am Gerät ist wirklich absolut genial! Sehr schade, dass andere Hersteller noch nicht auf den Zug aufgesprungen sind. Wäre auf jeden Fall sehr viel nützlicher, als zum Beispiel die Bixbytaste am S10.- Dem Gerät liegt eine Transparente Schutzhülle bei. Diese ist von der Qualität wirklich gut und weiß zu begeistern. Leider kollidiert das Schutzcase etwas mit der Displayfolie.- Die Größe ist leider für mich ein negativer Punkt am Gerät. (Kann für andere natürlich auch grade der Vorteil sein)( Mit Schutzhülle angebracht, wird das Gerät leider noch viel klobiger.- Der Vibrationsmotor ist tatsächlich wirklich überarbeitet worden und überzeugt in ganzer Linie. Normalerweiße stelle ich das Tastaturfeedback immer aus. Aber hier ist es wirklich angenehm und weiß zu überzeugen.Kommen wir zum Fazit:Das Oneplus 7 Pro ist wirklich ein Wunderschönes Gerät mit einigen Innovationen (Notchloses 90 Hertz Display und Popup Kamera). Es hat ein paar Mängel, macht aber auch in anderen Disziplinen einiges her.Ich habe mein Gerät aufgrund der enormen Größe (Vorher testen ist leider, dank mangelnder Testexemplare im örtlichen Elektronikmarkt, nicht möglich) und ein paar Kleinigkeiten zurückgeschickt.Desweiteren muss man beachten, dass die UVP von 759 € für das Gerät mit 8 GB Ram zwar wesentlich geringer ausfällt als zum Beispiel die UVP von Samsung oder Huawei, dafür zum Beispiel ein S10 schon für knapp unter 600€ zu haben ist.Ein Flagshipkiller ist das OP 7 Pro in meinen Augen nicht! Dafür macht man in meinen Augen leider zuviele Abstriche (Stichwort IP Zertifizierung, Qi Charging, Kopfhörerbuchse bzw. nichtmal ein beiliegender Adapter oder eben die Kamera die für mich nicht ganz oben mitspielt.). Jedoch stecken in Ihm auch Dinge die man aktuell in keinem anderen Handset bekommt (90 Hertz & Warpcharging)Alles in allem bekommt das OP 7 Pro von mir 4 von 5 möglichen Amazon Sternen."", 'Hey, ihr Leser da Draußen!Vorab möchte ich sagen, dass es sich bei dieser Rezension um eine vorzeitige Einschätzung handelt.Ich gehe nicht im Detail auf die technischen Daten ein, diese sind überall im Internet frei zugänglich, und jeder kann sie auf diversen Seiten auch gut vergleichen. ;-)Es geht hier um meinen Eindruck, und wie sich das Handy, in den ersten Tagen, bewährt.Das Oneplus 7 Pro läuft, und zwar subjektiv gesehen sehr gut, schnell und effektiv. Es fühlt sich, für mich, hochwertig und edel an. Auch wenn es OHNE Hülle einigermaßen gut in der Hand liegt, rate ich dringend dazu eine Hülle zu kaufen. Natürlich bekommt das Handy dadurch zusätzliches Gewicht, aber es liegt wesentlich sicherer in der Hand und die abgerundeten Ecken erhalten einen nicht zu unterschätzenden Schutz.Handhaltung:Gewicht: 206 GrammGröße: 162.6 MM hoch, 76 MM breit, 8.8 MM dickJa, es ist schwerer als andere Handys von diversen bekannten Marken. Und ja, es liegt entsprechend anders in der Hand. Ja, es ist größer als der Durchschnitt. Einhändiges Bedienen geht bedingt, letztendlich kommt es darauf an was man an dem Handy machen möchte, aber es geht. Einzig allein der obere Displaybereich ist, wenn man das Handy einhändig bedienen will, schwierig zu erreichen, entsprechend ist man dazu veranlagt es irgendwie in der Hand hin und her rutschen zu lassen. (Mit einer Hülle kann es einfacher gehen). Letztendlich muss aber gesagt sein, dass ein großes Display auch entsprechende Vorteile liefert, SOFERN die Hardware mithält. Und das tut sie hier bei dem Oneplus 7 proEine Auflösung von 1440 x 3120 px, eine Pixeldichte von 516 ppi, 90 Hertz (!) und Amoled-Technologie Hinter dem Display verspricht (und hält es auch) eine top Qualität, wo das Schauen von Filmen, Youtube Clips und Videos angenehm ist.Leistung im AlltagIn dem Oneplus 7 Pro ist der Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 verbaut, ein Prozessor der durchaus in der High-End Klasse angesiedelt ist. Mit anderen Worten, wir haben hier einen Prozessor der mit 2133MHz auffährt, schnell taktet. Wer auf Gaming aus ist, der kann durchaus von dem Oneplus profitieren. Eines sei aber gesagt, dass es am Ende ""nur"" ein Smartphone ist, und an sich hat jedes Smartphone Probleme mit der Wärmeentwicklung, wenn es darum geht auf eine längere Dauer leistungsintensive Spiele zu spielen (PubG etc).KameraEin Handy kann noch so toll sein, doch wenn die Kamera mist ist, dann überlebt das Handy nicht...Und ja, ist die Kamera Mist oder kann sie mithalten? Als damals das Oneplus 7 pro auf den Markt kam, schwächelte das Handy tatsächlich in Sachen Kamera. Die Hardware ist eigentlich gut, doch die Software hatte seine Macken. Im Laufe der vergangenen Monate kamen jedoch immer wieder Updates, die auch die Qualität der Kamera angehoben haben. Mittlerweile kann man also sagen... Ja, die Kamera ist toll und die Qualität völlig in Ordnung!Auf der Rückseite sind drei Kameras verbaut (48MP & 16MP & 8MP). Hauptkamera, Weitwinkel und eine Zoom-Linse, die bis zu einem 3x Zoom garantieren soll. Dabei muss gesagt werden, es handelt sich eher um ein 2,5x Zoom. Der Rest wird von der Software""zusammengeschnitten"".Die Frontkamera fährt mit 16MP.Die Pixelsensoren der Kameras auf der Rückseite haben eine Pixelgröße von 1.6µm & 1µm & 0.8µm. Je größer, desto mehr Licht kann absorbiert werden, was zu besseren Fotos führen kann.Zwischen den drei Kameras auf der Rückseite ist noch ein automatischer Laser-Fokus eingebaut.Man kann mit dem Oneplus 7 pro Fotos machen, man kann auch gute Fotos machen, und es kann auch Spaß machen Fotos zu schießen! Die Qualität überzeugt, die Bilder sehen toll aus. Natürlich kann man, wenn man es will, immer noch nach Macken und Kanten suchen, an die Software anderer großer Marken kommt sie vielleicht nicht so sehr heran, doch dafür verlangt man keinen vierstelligen Betrag für das Handy.Für die Qualität sei eines gesagt: Je mehr Licht (natürliches Licht) vorhanden, desto besser wird auch das Foto. Für mich persönlich reicht es, da es auch gut aussieht. Immerhin befinden wir uns hier auf einem hohen Niveau!Über die Frontkamera muss ich wenig sagen, außer dass diese Kamera das gibt, was sie auch verspricht. Tolle, satte Fotos! Und wer nun Angst hat, dass diese ""Pop-Up"" Funktion eine Gefahrenstelle sei, bzw. dass dort Wasser eindringen könne oder ähnliches .... Oneplus hat eine Gummidichtung in die Pop-Up Kamera eingebaut, die durchaus in der Lage sein soll(!) Wasser und ähnliches abzuhalten.Ich könnte jetzt noch weiter ausholen, und schreiben und schreiben, aber dann wird es zu viel.Also kann man das Handy kaufen? Absolut, Ja! Wie ist das Preis- und Leistungsverhältnis? Es ist gut, aber es kommt darauf an zu welchem Preis es angeboten wird, daher ist da meine Empfehlung den Preis zu beobachten und nicht blind zu kaufen. 700 Euro und mehr würde ich dafür nicht ausgeben, daher gut überlegen, beobachten und aufpasse! ;-)Mein persönliches Highlight an dem Handy ist das Betriebssystem ""OxygenOS"". Ein aufgeräumtes, überschaubares System OHNE vorinstallierte Apps von Dritte, die man NICHT deinstallieren kann. Es macht einfach Spaß mit dem System zu arbeiten, da es sich frei und unberührt anfühlt (Klingt komisch aber man muss es halt einfach selber getestet haben, um zu verstehen was ich meine! ;-) )Ich hoffe, dass mein Eindruck ein wenig helfen konnte. Letztendlich kann ich nur empfehlen selber auf diverse Internetseiten nachzuforschen, wie sich die technischen Details im Kern anfühlen sollen, ob das Handy das verspricht was es sagt, und wie die Vergleiche mit anderen Flaggschiffen großer Markenkonzerne sind.', ""Dopo una settimana di utilizzo posso dire che questo Oneplus 7 pro si è rilevato un ottimo smartphone, nulla da invidiare ai top di gamma di quest'anno che si sono rilevati decisamente costosi.È la prima esperienza con Oneplus e la tanto narrata super fluidità si nota subito, la parte forte è il display, un display grande a 90hz e con una super risoluzione, l'ideale per la multimedialità, grazie anche all'audio che è davvero ottimo.Processore al top, mai un lag e non scalda mai, non noterete una differenza sostanziale con gli 865 di quest'anno. Ovviamente questi pregi si pagano un po' lato autonomia, c'è da premettere che si arriva sempre a sera e si fanno sempre come minimo 6 ore e 30 di display acceso e almeno 26/27h d'uso dall'ultima ricarica. Se si decide di portare il telefono a 60hz, ma non ve lo consiglio in quanto la differenza si nota, o abbassare la risoluzione a FHD, la scelta consigliata in quanto non si nota grande differenza, l'autonomia sarà più duratura, si arriveranno a fare poco più di 7 ore di display acceso, non cambia molto ma se vi aspetta una giornata stress anche un 7/10% in più di batteria è utile.Fotocamera ottima per il poco uso che ne Faccio, ottime foto e ottima stabilizzazione, video in 4k davvero ben fatti.In generale è davvero un ottimo smartphone, forse la scelta più adatta se volete un vero top di Oneplus e non volete spendere cifre enormi, visto che la serie 8 in questa configurazione supera i 1000€, in generale 7 pro e 7t pro convengono di più se non vi crea problemi la mancanza della ricarica wireless e della certificazione ip68, anche se comunque la serie 7 è resistente ma non certificata e i danni da liquidi non sono mai coperti da garanzia nonostante la certificazione.Questo è un ottimo telefono, consigliato se fate un ampio uso di contenuti multimediali, va comprato principalmente per lo schermo che, come già detto, è la parte forte, se non guardate molti video o comunque non sfruttate le potenzialità di questo display consiglio altro perché lo schermo così grande, e curvo tra l'altro, può risultare scomodo se poi non lo si sfrutta al meglio.Per il prezzo beh ormai tutti i brand hanno alzato l'asticella quindi per queste prestazioni si paga, preso in offerta lampo, ma in generale tra questo e il 7t pro non troverete nessuna differenza, ovviamente a seconda del prezzo e della differenza conviene il 7t pro ma ciò dipende da voi, in generale super consigliato."", 'Mein erstes OnePlus Smartphone und bisher bin ich absolut begeistert.Besonderheiten:Randloses Display ohne Notch, Loch oder Balken, dank ausfahrbarer Frontcam. Für mich die mit Abstand eleganteste Lösung, ich mache aber zugegebenermaßen sehr wenig Selfies. Ob die Mechanik auch in 2 Jahren noch so tadellos funktioniert, wird sich zeigen. Bisher habe ich keine Problem damit. Auch das face-unlock klappt problemlos, wobei ich normalerweise aber den Fingerabdruck Scanner zum Entsperren nutze, das liegt mir einfach mehr, keine Ahnung wieso.90 Hz Bildwiederholrate auf großem wirklich gutem Display. Ob man das braucht? Ich kann es ehrlich gesagt nicht wirklich sagen aber der Trend geht ja klar in die Richtung 90 oder sogar 120Hz Displays zu verbauen. Das Display ist auf jeden Fall Klasse. Hell, kontrastreich, gestochen scharf, einfach ein richtig guter Bildschirm.Performance ist erstklassig, dank Snapdragon Prozessor und 8 GB RAM läuft das 7Pro wie geschmiert.Speicherplatz ist nicht erweiterbar, was zwar Schade ist, da sowieso ein Dual Sim Träger vorhanden ist, bei dem aber eben nur SIM Karten und nicht wie bei anderen Geräten sowohl SIM als auch Speicherkarten verwendet werden können. Allerdings sind 250 GB Speicherplatz wiederum für die allermeisten Nutzer mehr als genug, für mich definitiv, somit für mich kein negativer Punkt, muss ich schon keine zusätzliche Speicherkarte kaufen.Die Kamera ist nach meinem Empfinden nach sehr gut. Ich denke da ist OnePlus von den Top Smartphonecams von Huawei, Apple oder Samsung quasi kaum mehr zu unterscheiden. Die ""Profi-Fotografen"" unter euch, falls solche tatsächlich Handys fürs Fotografieren nutzen 😜 finden aber bestimmt Gründe warum irgendwelche anderen Smartphone Kameras viel besser sind.Der Akku hält bei meiner Nutzung, die aus hauptsächlich Nachrichten lesen, Musik, hin und wieder Videos schauen, WhatsApp und ein paar Telefonaten täglich besteht auch bei für mich starker Nutzung problemlos den ganzen Tag durch.Telefon-Qualität, ja tatsächlich können das die Smartphones immer noch, ist für mich super. Sowohl bei Lautstärke, Empfang, Verständlichkeit auf beiden Seiten als auch beim Freisprechen gibt es Nichts zu bemängeln.Design - TOP.. mehr Beschreibung braucht es nicht, ein wirklich schönes Smartphone.Vorne und hinten Glas und die abgerundeten Kanten machen das Gerät zwar elegant aber halt auch zwangsweise glatt und man lebt immer mit der Gefahr dass es einem mal aus der Hand rutscht. Daher ist eine vernünftige Silikon Hülle, wie bei eigentlich allen Smartphones ratsam. Die mitgelieferte, ja ist tatsächlich dabei, dafür aber Headset ist ziemlich gut.Wissen sollte man noch, dass das Gerät groß und sicherlich nicht leicht ist, wobei alle Geräte dieser Größe da ziemlich gleich auf liegen. Es ist kein Headset dabei, es hat keinen Kliniken Anschluss sondern nur einen USB Typ C Anschluss, für mich belanglos da ich eh über Bluetooth höre. Adapter USB C auf Klinke gibt\'s aber für wenig Geld, daher sicher zu verkraften. Wasserfest soll es angeblich sein, allerdings ohne Zertifizierung. Naja Schwimmen gehe ich damit sicher nicht, das würde ich aber auch mit einem nach IP XY zertifizierten Gerät nicht tun. Telefonieren im Regen und wahrscheinlich auch mal ein Sturz in eine wässrige Lösung beliebiger Art wird\'s bestimmt überleben.Sonst gibt nicht mehr viel zu sagen.Achja der Preis. Für ein Smartphone auf Top Niveau, das sich nicht mehr oder wenn dann nur noch in für mich nicht relevanten Punkten von den Topmodellen von Apple, Samsung oder Huawei unterscheidet oder sogar besser ist, ist der Preis völlig akzeptabel. Ich habe es kurz vor Erscheinen des Nachfolgers dem 7T Pro, welches nahezu identisch ist gekauft. OnePlus wird jedoch auch immer teurer. Logisch, es sind halt die gleichen Komponenten in der gleichen Qualität verbaut wie bei vergleichbaren Geräten. Ein bisschen günstiger ist OnePlus aber immer noch, von daher kann ich dieses Gerät wie auch die Marke selbst aus dem Gesichtspunkt Preis-Leistung noch empfehlen.', 'Envio:Mi pedido fue por medio de DHL, pude rastrear el envio durante todo momento y la estimacion de envio de DHL fue puntual, incluso 1 dia antes de lo que me aparecia por parte de amazon.Empaque:El empaque de DHL llego de forma decente, la bosla de aire que esta dentro de la caja de DHL se desinflo, en cuanto a la caja de OnePlus, no tiene la banda roja de OnePlus Community que se ve en fotos oficiales, tiene sellos de plastico a los lados, desconozco si esos sellos sean ""oficiales"". Toda la documentacion, garantia, instrucciones y stickers del telefono viene en Chino (no conozco el lenguaje asi que es solo lo que yo imagino). Accesorios como cargador, pin para remover el sim y el protector vienen en perfectas condiciones.Calidad.La calidad de la pantalla es excelente excepto a 3 detalles en la superficie de la pantalla que detecte, una linea en la parte superior, y dos pequeñas marcas. Ninguna de estas es realmente visible mientras usas el telefono independientemente del contenido que estes viendo, solo las puedes ver contra la refleccion de alguna luz. Desconozco si las imperfecciones son de fabrica o cual es la razon de estas, tratare de incluir fotos al respecto en cuanto tenga tiempo.Telefono.El telefono en si es excellente, hay muchos reviews en internet sobre el telefono y no puedo decir mas que ellos, es rapido, la pantalla a 90hz se ve genial, la camara es relativamente buena, no tiene certificacion de resistencia al agua pero he visto videos donde lo sumergen sin ningun problema, creo que si eres cuidadoso no deberias tener problemas al respecto. No hay ranura de expansion pero tienes 256gb de inicio cosa que creo mas que suficiente, no tiene ranura para audifonos, tendras que usar una conexion usb-c, un adaptador o algo inalambrico.ConectividadEl wifi funciona muy bien, lo he probado hasta 100mb de descarga y 10mb de subida. En cuanto a red se conecto con Telcel sin ningun problema y una vez con datos solo necesite reiniciar el equipo y tenia conexion 4g, con 6-7Mbps de subida y bajada en una conexion y 13/11 respectivamente con conexiones multiples, esto fue con una señal de aprox 60%, tal vez en alguna otra zona me de mejor velocidad.Resumen: El telefono es genial, las imperfecciones en la pantalla, el hecho que no se especifica que la caja e instructivos estan en chino, la falta de garantia (que no es culpa del vendedor al ser importado) son los unicos contras en mi caso, pero al final del dia los pros son mayores.Update: Las marcas en la pantalla son del protector que viene pre-aplicado, ahora no tengo ninguna queja de mi compra.', 'Este teléfono es el mejor que ha hecho nunca OnePlus, y los he tenido y todos desde el 5. Antes de eso, he tenido Samsung, Sony y siempre fui muy fiel a Apple hasta que probé OnePlus y su fluidez, calidad y precio me ganaron.Trabajo con el móvil cada día desde las 9 de la mañana hasta eso de las 12 de la noche. Ahí está mi único gran pero a este terminal: la batería. Desenchufandolo a las 9 a las 13 ya ando en torno al 60%. Sí, la carga rápida ayuda, pero eso no quita que lo tenga que tener enchufado un buen rato a mediodía cada día, lo cual es muy molesto.Por lo demás, la cámara es la mejor que han tenido nunca, el terminal es precioso, la huella la reconoce rapidísimo y bueno, solo tengo buenas palabras en general. Para todo, menos para la batería.Aún así, ningún terminal hoy en día aguanta el día entero para mí dada la cantidad de horas de pantalla que yo necesito al día. Por cierto, la media que me da a mí con una carga es de 6 y pico horas de pantalla.Lo recomiendo? Sin dudarlo. Pero el cargador, si lo usas mucho, llévalo contigo.EDITO TRAS DOS MESES DE USO:A pesar de que el teléfono me encantaba, me he desecho de él. El tema de la batería era insoportable. Los 90hz se la comen y tener este móvil para andar con él “limitado” a 60hz me parece absurdo. Y ni con esas me aguantaba la batería un día entero. Ni mucho menos! A las 3 de la tarde, el teléfono cargando. Desenchufado de nuevo al 100% y a las 9 de la noche ya andaba en torno al 20%, así que otra vez a enchufarlo para estar usándolo hasta dormir.Así que... teniendo que cargarlo a veces hasta tres veces al día tienes la sensación de pasarte el día con él enchufado. Supongo que en la versión 7t pro mejorarán la batería. No entiendo la manía de hacer teléfonos tan finos. Que los hagan un poco más gordos y nos den 1000 mha más por lo menos.En fin... si la batería para ti no es un problema, o si no le das un uso intensivo como yo... pues perfecto. Si no, te recomiendo otras opciones que hagan una mejor gestión de la potencia. Ah! Y sí, la carga rápida ayuda, pero eso no quita que en mitad del día tengas que tenerlo enchufado al menos una hora. Lo que, para mí, es un engorro.', 'Ich besitze das OnePlus 7 Pro nunmehr seit gut einer Woche und möchte euch meinen Gesamteindruck zu diesem Gerät mitteilen:Optik und Haptik:Ganz klar ist das OP7 Pro ein Handschmeichler. Aufgrund der Form und der nun etwas angewachsenen Dicke liegt das Handy top in der Hand. Einzig und allein die etwas glatte Rückseite macht es schwierig dieses Handy ohne Hülle zu benutzen drum bitte immer mit Hülle benutzen sonst habt ihr euren Spaß daran gehabt wenn das 750€ teuere Gerät auf den Boden fällt. Optisch kann ich nur sagen Hut ab OnePlus da habt ihr ein Handy produziert welches absolut den Zeitgeist trifft und durch die Mirror Black Rückseite einiges hermacht!Leistung:Angetrieben vom SD855 zerstört dieses Handy eigentlich alles was Apptechnisch auf den Markt ist. Selbst Hardcore PUBG Zocker können dieses Handy nicht mal ansatzweise ins Schwitzen bringen. Was auch noch posititv zu erwähnen ist, ist der neue UFS 3.0 Standard der dafür sorgt das Apps und Daten noch schneller geladen werden wie bisher ! Der USB C 3.0 Anschluss ist auch sehr gut wenn man Daten vom Rechner auf das Smartphone lädt, denn die meisten Flagships haben zwar USB Typ C aber nach wie vor den langsamen USB2.1 Standard... Der RAM Speicher ist auch außerordentlich schnell. Der Antutu Benchmark spuckt bei mir phänomenale 376000 Punkte aus und ist damit das schnellste Handy dass ich bisher getestet habe.Kamera:Hierbei möchte ich das Xiaomi Mi9 als direkten Konkurrenten mit einbeziehen weil sich die Ergebnisse daran sehr gut messen lassen da beide ähnliche Sensoren besitzen. Aber um es kurz zu machen das OnePlus ist dem Mi9 in Sachen Zoomqualität und Dynamikumfang leicht überlegen aber das sind nur Nuancen. Im gesamten produziert das OnePlus 7 Pro hervorragende Bilder her und der Sony IMX 586 hält wirklich was er verspricht. Das lässt Instagram und Socialmediaherzen höher schlagen.Akku:Bei einem 4000mAh Akku hält man als Powernutzer ohne Probleme einen Tag durch. Wenn man sparsam ist und die Bildschirmauflösung und Wiederholrate auf FHD+ und 60Hz stellt sind sogar easy 2 Tage drin. Der mitgelieferte Powercharger mit seinem Warpcharge pumpt den Akku bei 30W innerhalb von 70 Min von 0 - 100% was unglaublich schnell ist bedenkt man die Größe des Akkus.Display:Ich habe noch nie so ein schönes Display bei einem Smartphone gesehen außer vielleicht noch das QHD+ Display vom neuen Samsung Galaxy. Die 90Hz Technik schockt schon wahnsinnig weil dadurch die ""Speed"" des Handys noch besser herauskommt. Kritikpunkt ist für mich persönlich der Curvedscreen da dieser im Licht störende Reflexionen wirft und das Bild beim Filme gucken etwas verzerrt...Konnektivität:Das Smartphone besitzt eigentlich alles was man als Smartphoneuser braucht (LTE Band 20 etc.) außer Kabelloses Laden und einen Klinkeanschluss. Zumindest kabelloses Laden wäre noch nice gewesen bei dieser Preisklasse ...GPS funkt super auch das GSM Modul arbeitet so wie es soll, alles einwandfrei!Fazit:Ich kann das OnePlus 7 Pro uneingeschränkt empfehlen aber nicht zu diesem Preis drum einen Stern abzug (realistischer wäre ein Preis um 550€). Besonders geflasht hat mich das 90Hz Display und die super Performance der Hardware. Der In Displayfingerprint ist auch der Wahnsinn und entsperrt das Handy wirklich fix, ich hab keinen so schnellen Sensor gesehen. Auch die Kamera ist über jeden Zweifel erhaben und produziert hervorragende Bilder.', 'Mittlerweile ist der Markt was Android Smartphones angeht ziemlich übersättigt so dass die Auswahl nicht mehr so leicht ist. Hier sticht aber OnePlus positiv heraus. Was mich letztlich dazu bewogen hat sich für das 7 Pro zu entscheiden war zum einen das 90 Hz Display, aber auch Arbeitsspeicher (8GB) wie auch Festspeicher von 256 GB sowie die Update Politik von OnePlus.Während Samsung und Co. Android 10 ankündigen (ist ja auch leichter als es bereit zu stellen) zeigt OnePlus wie schnell es gehen kann. Android 10 kam die letzten Tage per Update an und es funktioniert alles reibungslos.Das Gehäuse ist sehr gut verarbeitet, liegt gut in der Hand und die Geschwindigkeit des Snapdragon 855 lässt keine Wünsche offen. Die eingebauten Lautsprecher sind in Stereo, aber leider vom Klang nur Durchschnitt. Hier klingt ein Goggle Pixel 3 XL deutlich besser.Das Display sieht aus wie gedruckt, tolle Farben, kein Flimmern, sehr schnelle Reaktionszeit. Alles läuft sehr flüssig. Die Helligkeit des Displays ist sehr hell, auch hier schön anzusehen. Der Fingerprint im Display funktioniert zuverlässig und schnell, nicht wie beim Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus, welcher mich schon zur Weißglut brachte. Dennoch eine Kleinigkeit, wer ein iPhone nutzt wird es sicherlich wissen. Hier läuft das iOS einfach noch geschmeidiger und flüssiger (nur eine kleine Randinfo).Die eingebaute Hauptkamera macht sehr schöne Bilder mit angenehmen Farben jedoch zeigt sie bei Landschaftsaufnahmen das der Hintergrund wie gemalt aussieht und Elemente wie z.B. Bäume oder Häuser dort keine Details zeigen und nur angedeutet werden. Hier zeigt z.B. ein Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro (249 Euro) weitaus mehr Details. Die Frontkamera, welche bei Bedarf ausfährt, liefert schöne und genaue Details.Der eingebaute Akku hält bei mir mit normaler Nutzung fast drei Tage. Ich kenne kein Smartphone das bisher bei mir so positiv eine Akkulaufzeit hat hinbekommen. Hier zeigt OnePlus was die Energieverwaltung angeht wirklich sehr gute Arbeit geleistet hat. Aufladen geht dank des Warp Charge Netzteil rasend schnell, jedoch muss man sich keine Sorgen machen da hier intelligent aufgeladen wird, heißt einfach ausgedrückt, je höher der Stand des Akkus desto weniger Energie wird in den Akku abgegeben.Was auch sehr positiv aufgefallen ist, dass OnePlus 7 Pro stellt sehr schnell Telefon-Verbindungen her. Das hatte bisher nur Apple so hinbekommen. Die Sprachqualität ist deutlich und auch laut. VoLTE wird voll unterstützt.Insgesamt ist das Paket was hier OnePlus abliefert, gemessen am Preis schon sehr überzeugend. Einzig bei dem Lautsprecher könnte man etwas nachlegen. Leider besitzt es kein Drahtloses laden. IP 68 ist auch nicht vorhanden, aber mal ehrlich, wer will sein Smartphone unter Wasser nutzen? Gegen Spritzwasser scheint es geschützt zu sein, denn am Sim-Kartenschacht ist unter anderem auch eine Dichtung zu sehen.Kommen wir zu der Frage ob es eine Kaufempfehlung wert ist? Leistung, Ausstattung, Updates, ganz klar ja. Legt jemand auf drahtloses Laden wert oder einer IP68 Zertifizierung, dann ehr nein.', 'Seit ein paar Tagen bin ich stolzer Besitzer eine OnePlus 7 Pro. Die letzten Jahre habe ich immer mal wieder mit einem OnePlus geliebäugelt....bin aber immer wieder bei meiner Lieblingsmarke LG gelandet. Nun muss ich sagen, das ich mit diesem Smartphone eine neue Lieblingsmarke habe.Hier merkt man wirklich, das sich Gedanken gemacht wurde. Ich bin von dem LG V30 auf das 7 Pro gewechselt und ich merke mehr als Starke Unterschiede.Bis jetzt war für mich ein IPhone immer am besten abgestimmt, was die Hard & Software anging, aber bei diesem Handy...alles butterweich, flüssig und mit dem OxygenOS einfach super strukturiert.Einzig muss man sich ein wenig umgewöhnen, weil das schnelle Umstellen von Ton auf Vibration / Lautlos über die Stausleiste erfolgte. Hier wird dies über einen Slider an der Seite durchgeführt. Daran gewöhnt man sich aber schnell und als Kritikpunkt wäre dies Jammern auf sehr hohem Niveau.Das erste Lade erfolgte bei 25% und war innerhalb von gut 35 - 40 Min komplett voll. WowIn Mirror Grey ist das Telefon, wie viele andere, ein absoluter Fingerabdruckmagnet. Die blaue Farbe sieht hier viel besser aus, aber mal ehrlich....wer nutzt so ein Handy heutzutage ohne eine Hülle?Da ich persönlich lieber eine schwarze Silikonhülle benutzte, weil die transparenten mit der Zeit alle eine Gelbstich bekommen, war mir die Farbe ehrlich gesagt egal.Für alle die, die wie ich nach einer Hülle geschaut haben, die mit einer Folie / Panzerglasfolie nutzbar ist ohne diese anzuheben....dem kann ich die Spigen K09CS26390 ( ASIN: B07QQ9LSK4 ) empfehlen. Die vorinstallierte Folie hat noch minimal Platz zur Hülle und wir durch diese nicht beeinträchtigt....klasse.Wie in vielen Youtube Tests oft erwähnt, das Handy ist nicht das leichteste....aber meiner Meinung nach noch voll akzeptabel. Hier muss man einfach akzeptieren, das ein Handy mit einem 4000mAh Akku, einem 6,67 Zoll Display kein Leichtgewicht sein kann. Trotz seiner Größe ist es aber gut zu bedienen. Der Fingerabdruckscanner ist gut platziert und funktioniert einwandfrei.OnePlus mausert sich langsam zu einem Premiumhersteller, der sich mit seinen Smartphone vor der Konkurrenz nicht verstecken muss. Wer vor dem eintreffen seines 7 Pro mal im Elektromarkt seines Vertrauens mit einem S10+ ausgiebig herumspielt, der wird dann die Unterschiede feststellen. Ich hatte kein aktuelles Smartphone in der Hand, welches so schnell ist wie das OnePlus 7 Pro. Es macht einfach Spaß das Teil in der Hand zu haben.Wer bereit ist 759€ für ein Smartphone auszugeben, wir hier nicht enttäuscht und begeistert sein.']"

Por donde empezar, su sistema de cámaras que son muy versátiles, su pantalla, su duración de batería, el diseño. Todas estas cosas que acabo de decir es lo mejor que tiene este teléfono.  Esta reseña la realizo después de usar el teléfono por 2 meses, realmente fue un regalo para mi esposa y ella había usado iPhone por años y a pesar que estaba super acostumbrada a esos dispositivos la transición no le costo nada de trabajo.Las cámaras, son simplemente asombrosas, las fotos es lo que mas envidian el resto de la competencia. son fáciles de usar a pesar que tenga 3 camaras traseras. cada una la usas según la situación en la que te encuentres, el modo noche es lo característicos de estos modelos ya que ganan por goleada a todos sus competidores. El punto malo de esta sección es que el vídeo le falta un poco por mejorar en la calidad y estabilidad.Pantalla, es de las mejores del mercado. bonitos colores, los puedes ajustar a tu gusto, bajo la luz del sol se puede ver el contenido que estés viendo sin problema alguno.Autonomía, es una bestia, mi esposa se quejaba mucho de la duración de la batería de los iPhone, ahora con este le dura todo el dia con uso intensivo o hasta 2 días de uso normal, su tiempo de carga es brutal, en 50 min a 1hrs lo cargas al 100 si lo tienes al 20-25% con su cargador de carga rápida. Punto malo en este apartado es que no trae carga inalambricaEl diseño, es fantástico y de calidad, cuando lo tienes en la mano sientes una pieza solida de calidad, esta hecho de cristal al frente y atras, con unos marcos de aluminio pulido. El color unicornio es una alucinación, todo el mundo que se lo ha visto piensan que trae una funda que hace ese efecto. simplemente es hermoso ese color sobretodo para una mujer.Accesorios incluidos, en este apartado tampoco se queda atrás, incluye una mica de protección para la pantalla, una funda trasparente para que luzca su color, cargador y cable de carga rápida, y unos audífonos con la misma calidad que los que trae un iPhone. En este apartado le gana a la competencia, no ocupas invertir en cosas para proteger tu inversión porque simplemente ya lo incluye todo en la caja del teléfono.Seguridad, el lector de huellas en pantalla es genial y super moderno.Capacidad, uff... trae 6gb de RAM y 128 GB de almacenamiento, mientras que un iPhone trae de entrada 64GB y sale un 40 % mas economicamente.Se imaginaran que trabajo para Huawei pero la realidad es que no, me sorprendieron los chinos con el nivel de innovación y calidad de estos productos de gama alta, porque he los gama baja he escuchado a amigos que no son muy buenos. A pesar del beto de USA este modelo es actualizable a Android 10 sin problema alguno.Tanto me gusto que me compre un Huawei P30 Pro Rojo a pesar que fui un apple fan por mas de 10 años, y la verdad actualmente no extraño mi viejo iPhone. Si no me crees entra al P30 Pro para que leas mi reseña de ese teléfono(Las fotos que tome para esta reseña las tome con el P30 Pro)', 'Llevo una semana usando el Huawei P30, mi teléfono anterior era un LG G6. Debo decir que hasta ahora, ha superado todas mis expectativas. Decidí cambiar de teléfono por tres razones, mi anterior móvil empezaba a quedarse sin batería alrededor de las 3-4 pm, 30% de carga restante para esas alturas del día. La pantalla empezó a tener problemas con el ""touch"" y ya no era rápido como antes, de repente se quedaba pasmado. No tenia esos problemas muy a menudo pero definitivamente ya no se sentía como tope de gama.Mi nuevo Huawei P30 todavía tiene 50% de batería iniciando el segundo día, lo cual me impresiona, de todo modos lo pongo a cargar en lo que me ducho por la mañana y se carga rapidísimo. Ya no ando pensando en la batería de mi teléfono mientras hago mis actividades diarias. Lo cual me da una sensación de libertad que no sentía desde los teléfonos viejitos Nokia que tenían su lamparita en la parte superior.Otra cosa que me gustó es lo rápido que es, ademas tiene una pantalla ligeramente mas grande a pesar de ser mas o menos de tamaño idéntico a mi viejo teléfono. A mi no me gustan esos nuevos teléfonos gigantes, jaja. A pesar de tener manos grandes, hay situaciones en donde tengo que usar ambas manos para estar cómodo.Aunque no todo es mejor, el lector de huella digital en la pantalla no es tan bueno como los de botón de los celulares de hace unos años. Falla en reconocerme 1 de 3 veces. El de mi LG G6 quizás fallaba 1 de 100. Esto seria algo muy negativo pero, el P30 se desbloquea fácilmente utilizando la cámara frontal con mi rostro. Ademas que solo con colocar el teléfono cerca de mi cara, se da cuenta que lo quiero usar y se desbloquea sin que yo presione un botón.Cabe mencionar que el teléfono advierte que el desbloqueo por rostro, no es tan seguro como el dactilar. Pero si es mucho mas conveniente en mi experiencia hasta ahora. De hecho prefiero desbloquearlo con mi rostro.Otra característica que me gusto es que la pantalla es mas fácil de leer bajo la luz del sol a medio día. Ademas de que en comparasion con el LG G6, el P30 conserva la señal 4G con mayor facilidad y la recepción es notoriamente mas clara y con menos perdida de sonido en las llamadas. Sin embargo la bocina durante las llamadas suena un poco raro. Prefiero por mucho poner el alta-voz, que usa otra bocina en la parte inferior del teléfono, o en su defecto los manos libres.Y bueno, nunca eh sido fan de tomar fotos, pero debo decir que las opciones fotográficas de este teléfono me están entusiasmando a adentrarme al mundo de la fotografía. En especial las fotos en condiciones de poca luz, son mucho mejores a cualquier teléfono que yo eh tenido.Tiene mas cosillas extras que hacen la experiencia muy buena en mi opinión. Lo recomiendo ampliamente y el precio se me hace razonable.', ""I am coming from a Huawei Honor 8 and I don't want a huge phone to replace my honor 8 and the pro version was just too big, adding a case on it will get it even bigger so I settled with this standard P30 and with the headphone jack which I occasionally use it's a no brainier better choice for me. And even with it's smaller form factor it's screen real estate is quite huge, a lot bigger than my honor 8 and even with my big hands reaching the very top of the screen is a stretch but luckily the one hand gestures is there.The camera is amazing, sure it would be nice to have that x5 optical zoom from the pro version but the x3 is quite enough. The night mode shots on both are practically the same. I uploaded one of the shots I took with the night mode on this phone. I am impressed. I can get good results with my honor 8 on pro mode but not like this. I provided the standard mode and night mode shots of my window view for comparisonBattery life is awesome, I've been playing online games on this phone everyday at least 2hours of game time and another 4hrs of on screen time with YouTube or vlc player and normal social media/browser use and at the end 0f the day I'd still have around 20-30% left on my battery. The provided charger does it's job so fast as well that I normally charge my phone 30mins before I go to bed and unplug it and it'll be ready for the next day. Even the honor 8 fast charger works but not at supercharging speed.Overall I can see this lasting me 3yrs again before I think of replacing it. Only reason why I replaced my honor 8 was it started to slow down. Probably coz it's not optimized anymore as it has an old version of android."", 'I love this thing. I\'ll start by saying the ONLY phone to pick for better battery life is the P30 pro. The only way your battery will die, is if you planned it to. It charges too fast and last too long otherwise.  The camera is well known. So, you know it\'s amazing quality. My only con with it, and maybe the entire phone, is I\'d like an option to force the telephoto lens. Sometimes it doesn\'t want to switch because of ""poor"" lighting, but I\'ll take my chances with poor lighting for better zoom quality. (There is a work around. Camera app, pro mode, camera settings, turn on raw images. In pro mode, you can only use the 3 lenses as is. No digital zoom, but it forces the lens. Just a hassle of having multiple photos after.) The OLED display is as clear as they come. The notch doesn\'t bother me at all. Speaker is loud, sometimes too loud lol. I have no problem with slowness or lag. It runs every app great, and fast. I\'ve done no hardcore gaming. Just light games: Stick Fight, Pako 2, Drone shadow strike. All ran smoothly. Can\'t comment on skin, as I use Nova launcher. Another con, expandable storage. Yes, it has expandable storage, but it\'s nano memory. Not micro. Huawei is the ONLY company that makes nano. I did not know nor realize this before buying. It was a big bummer. Their smallest is $60 for 64GB. Lastly, I got the Breathing Crystal and it\'s absolutely beautiful. It makes you want to get a case with a transparent back, like it did. It does come with a case, that\'s OK and clear. It also comes with a screen protector on it. Case and protector are for temporary use. So, makes sure to buy another pair. UNBAN HUAWEI!!!', ""This is by far a great phone for about half the price of the leading phone brands out there. It is super snappy, transitioning from screen to screen is smooth and running several apps at the same time doesn't slow it down.The display is wonderful, the home screen is akin to iPhone interface, but runs an android system. Videos look fluid and amazing, at the highest settings on Netflix and YouTube, for those streaming connoisseurs.For gamers out there, games run great, less input lag, I let my friend try out fortnite (I'm not really all that into it) And he liked how it felt. I play gacha games, and from the phone I had, It was an upgrade, because the frames per second were so low, the game suffered. Now, that's not the case.For Picture/Phone photographers out there, if you want something at the same tier as an iPhone, for less money, look no further. The pictures taken on this phone are phenomenal. It was crisp, and I even tried out taking pictures from far away, (as the pro version is known for) and this one is still pretty solid. It has minimal blur and focuses well at a distance. Overall pretty good photo taking phone.My only gripe, which doesn't have much of an impact on my rating, is that the Huawei services, arent available in the U. S. Unfortunately, probably because of the rumors circling the phone. But isn't much of a hindrance, however.I enjoyed this phone overall. Would recommend if you're on a budget!"", 'Siempre me había quejado por Android y su inestabilidad junto con demás problemas.Por eso cambié a iOS desde hace unos 5 años, sin embargo decidí comprar éste Huawei P30por las reseñas que vi y la cámara, además de las ofertas.En fin, me di cuenta que el problema es que no había comprado un gama alta y he de decirque... ¡MADRE MÍA! ¡Estoy FASCINADO con este teléfono!Lo compré directamente con Amazon México y el color Piedra Luna es una preciosidad !!!El teléfono es muy ligero, cabe en la mano perfectamente, y a pesar de ser grande no es tanvoluminoso como otros.

Lo tengo hace un mes y aún sigo descubriendo cosas que me sorprenden, como la carga inversa (poder usarlo como cargador para otros móviles que soporten carga inalambrica), o el receptor infrarrojo que permite utilizarlo como mando a distancia para casi cualquier dispositivo y a destacar principalmente sería la gran apertura focal y una calidad fotográfica digna de cualquier cámara profesional.Como contra, no permite ampliar el almacenamiento con tarjetas Micro SD (que de momento tampoco me ha hecho falta) y el lector de huellas digitales integrado en la pantalla funciona increible.PANTALLA: OLED 6,1 pulgadasPROCESADOR: Kirin 980MEMORIA RAM: 6 GBALMACENAMIENTO: 128 GB + NM CardSISTEMA OPERATIVO Android 9 Pie + capa EMUICÁMARAS TRASERAS 40 MP SuperSpectrum (f/1.8) + 16 MP (f/2.2, ultra gran angular) y 8 MP (f/2.4, zoom 3x, OIS)CÁMARA FRONTAL: 32 MP (f/2.0)BATERÍA : 3.650 mAh + Supercharge hasta 22,5 vatiosOTROS: USB tipo C 3.1, lector de huellas en pantalla, jack 3,5 mm', 'Ok, primero Amazon con su super envío llego bien empaquetado, sellado, nuevo sin un solo rasguño, desbloqueado, o sea, perfecto. Vamos al celular: originalmente quería un S10 plus, pero al ver el precio y la cámara me decepcionó un poco, busqué otra opción y me encontré con el Huawei p30 y p30 pro, obvio mi presupuesto estaba un poco limitado y por fortuna lo pusieron en descuento el p30. La cámara es bellísima, es super rápido, todas las apps que tenía en mi cel anterior (un pobre s7) corren de maravilla, se sincroniza super rápido con mis audífonos bluetooth, detecta el brillo de la habitación, tiene el modo blue light, en fin, el cel es una maravilla!! Estoy muy feliz con mi compra y si esta desbloqueado, le metí mi chip de telcel y lo agarro de inmediato.

Camera is stunning and the Huawei EMUi is very smooth to use. The sellers for the phones themselves though.. kinda shady. Mine was ""new"" but there were signed of use and OEM stickers being stuck back on. Light signs of use of frame. Just an FYI', ""Although I'm not a fan of the facial recognition concept. The fingerprint reader is great and quick to unlock the phone. The organization of photos, and the photo quality is absolutely fantastic. I, myself, am coming from the LG V20, and even though it was good, this was a GREAT switch based on performance.  No lag whatsoever, snappy, responsive, and the color of breading crystal was something I love the most. I did extensive research for the phone I wanted to use, and for the money, this is amazing. +1 for still having the headphone jack. The outgoing speaker at the bottom is good, only issue being that you can cover it with your finger accidentally, but still good quality and LOUD. If you're on a budget and still want greatness, this is an amazing phone.""]"
‎B07Q2N1P5N,Huawei P30 Pro 128GB 8GB RAM (VOG-L29) International Version - Breathing Crystal,Smartphones,S$693.85,https://www.amazon.sg/Huawei-128GB-VOG-L29-International-Version/dp/B07Q2N1P5N/ref=sr_1_379?qid=1695968277&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051%2Cp_72%3A6469119051%2Cp_36%3A20000-150000&rnid=6450031051&s=electronics&sr=1-379,https://www.amazon.sg/Huawei-128GB-VOG-L29-International-Version/product-reviews/B07Q2N1P5N/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,4.7,"['El mejor gama alta que he tenido hasta la fecha. Sin duda la función que más uso del celular, es la que más promocionaban y es el zoom, me gusta mucho. Sin embargo procuren no usar esa función de noche ya que su focal es de f3.4 lo que significa que tiene poca luminosidad, lo que se traduce en fotos o muy oscuras o muy ruidosas, pero de día sigue por encima incluso de los gama alta actuales.Para tomar fotos de noche para eso mejor usa la principal la cual es muy luminosa y toma muy buenas fotos incluso sin necesidad de usar el modo nocturno, aunque si lo quieres usar, el modo nocturno, adelante, le da un plus extra a tu foto.Sobre el modo pro, permite modificar todos los parámetros: ISO, tiempo de exposición, medición, balance de blancos, enfoque, compensación de la exposición.Si seleccionas guardar en RAW, y tiras la foto a 10MP, a saber que el jpg resultante será de 10MP, pero la foto en RAW sí se guardará a 40MP (7280x5456). Lo cual es bastante bueno, ya que te da más margen a la hora de editar en lightroom.También conviene saber que si tiras fotos en lugares donde haya reflejos de luz demasiado brillantes como por ejemplo un rio donde brille la luz del sol en el agua, tendrás una aberración cromática que no podrás sacar con nada (bueno si, a mano alzada en photoshop) , esto sucede por el sensor que lleva montado, el RYYB, así que procura evitar estas situaciones si eres de los que solo dispara en automático.Sobre el rendimiento del dispositivo, voy a hablar poco, pues es un gama alta que cuenta con uno de los kirin más poderosos que lanzó huawei en su momento, así que, corre en alto o ultra prácticamente todo lo que le eches.Sobre la pantalla, pues crei que la pantalla curva me iba a molestar, pero al no ser tan pronunciada te acostumbras rápidamente a ella, por lo que luego terminas pasándola por alto. Lo que no se pasa por alto, es que es difícil encontrar una funda y un protector de pantalla sin evitar que choquen entre ellos, la mayorías de las veces que sepas que la funda terminará levantando el protector.Sobre el software, la mejor versión es con la que ya viene el telefono EMUI 9 y android 9.  He probado distintas versiones upgradeando o downgradando con el software hisuite para PC incluido en el teléfono y en la mayoría malogran las cámaras, la principal baja la calidad aunque no es muy notorio, pero lo que si es notorio es el modo noche es cual se convierte en un autentico desastre.La mejor versión sigue siendo el EMUI que viene con android 9, aunque claro si no quieres estar desactualizado hay un par versiones en android 10 que funcionan bastante bien la EMUI 10.0.0.178 y 10.0.0.203, salvo un detalle, en el modo grabación de video, se activa el modo belleza aunque esté en 0, coloca el valor en 1, para que esto no pase, sino te molesta ese pequeño detalle te recomiendo dejar el telefono en una de esas versiones, para que al menos así tengas un android un poco más actual. Es lo que hize yo, me he dejado en la versión 10.0.0.203.Bueno eso es todo lo que tengo que decir, en general, estoy muy contento con el teléfono.', ""I happy to report that this phone, despite being a few model years old, still competes with the latest model Android phones as far as speed and features, but the camera is what makes this phone stand out. Today, 2023, this phone blows away most other brand phones as far as picture quality. Low light night photos are amazing! I bought the Breathing Crystal color and it's beautiful!The customer service I received from Sell Phone Basement was a truly wonderful experience! Delivery was made to me in an amazing 2 days. Thank you, Sell Phone Basement!"", 'Super satisfecho, cumple con mis necesidades.Batería: dura con uso intensivo todo el día y la carga rápida es una maravilla. Aunque no me ha sido muy necesaria la carga rápida ya que me dura todo el día la batería, se agradece el ahorro de tiempo.Memoria interna y Ram: en una maravilla poder instalar todas las aplicaciones que me gustan sin tener que preocuparse por saturar la memoria, además puedo trabajar con varias apps de edición de imagen al mismo tiempo muy fluidamente.Cámara: supuestamente la mejor cámara es del pixel 3, en cuanto calidad de imagen y rango dinámico en un lente único. En mi caso me enacta la fotografía y ya tengo una pentax K3 para cuando realmente mi prioridad es la calidad y el control manual... así que valoro mucho más la inmediatez y la versatilidad de una cámara de celular, así que me atrevo a decir que si no es la mejor cámara, si es la más divertida y versátil... Y sin duda el punto más fuerte de este celular. No le doy uso gamer, así que en cuanto a procesamiento, me basta y me sobra. La pantalla definitivamente no es la mejor, de hecho miro con envidia el el samsung S10 en ese apartado (se me osea cuando recuerdo que después de vender el y9 de regalo y las ofertas de Amazon solo pagué $12650 pesos mexicanos)La expansión de memoria aún no la requirió, pero no ocupa micro sd y eso me molesta, sin embargo si hay memorias huawei disponibles.Ya llevo 3 equipos con protección de líquidos y polvo, y aunque no lo valoro mucho, se agradece cuando estoy de vacaciones y, aunque no me arriesgo a sumergir los equipos, si he tenido accidentes y se agradece muchísimo la protección.En cuanto estética, es lo que menos me importa, igual lo protejo con una carcasa.La carencia de Jack 3.5 si me molesta mucho, pero igual se resuelve rápido con un dongle... Que incluso te podría ser una ventaja ya que me obligó a invertir en un buen Dac que mejora mucho el audio nativo del equipo.En conclusión, para mí este celular es el idóneo ya que en estos tres parámetros (autonomía, memoria, cámara) se desempeña exactamente como me gusta.', ""The battery life is spectacular, I bought it a while ago and it dies a little sooner than what it used to last year but not by much! It's huge yet it fits perfectly in my hand. There's a lot of cool aspects this Huawei has, and the camera quality is pretty good. HOWEVER Asian phones tend to have this automatic 'beauty effect' and it's incredibly annoying. Takes some time to get used to it, it's a bit tricky to lessen it's intensity since you can't turn it off. But for the battery life and it's effectiveness I can't complain too much. It's a beautiful color, definitely buy it a case. Slightly waterproof but don't push your luck. Oh, the storage capacity is AMAZING. I bought the 265 GB version so I never have to worry about storage capacity. The zoom is spectacular, I use it a lot when taking photos or trying to read something from afar. It's capable of fast charging which is a real treat.A few cons:The keyboard isn't intuitive if you're an apple user. I downloaded the Gboard app which is similar to the apple keyboard.-Sometimes the screen is sensitive and misinterprets your inputs. It's a bit annoying sometimes but it doesn't happen too much.-In the beginning it would constantly kick me out of the app I was using when typing. So annoying! Make sure to turn on your navigation bar, I did it and it was no longer an issue.That's it. Definitely worth the price."", ""UPDATE: After the latest software update the phone not only is it faster but the service probleme is fixed & wifi switch to a tower is fixed this phone deserves a 5 stars!The phone is great super fast super responsive I love every little thing about it keep in mind I'm a huge Samsung & Apple fan aside that if you plan to activate it in the U. S it will become a complete nightmare AT&T has no clue how because the device is not recognize by their system it works if you swap the SIM from an active phone but Everytime you toggle WiFi and then leave you need to reboot the device if you buy it you need to contact a third party hawei storbtonunlock this device I honestly got no where I had to rest the phone incert the SIM card bcak to iPhone then to bcak to the p30 then it'll work if you don't plan to stufgle and want a working device out of the box without the struggle of the companies not being able to fix it I recommend going somewhere but I would rate 5 stars but with all this headaches I bought it new and it's still locked it can no be activated in the us so you'll have problems here and their other wise it's better then any device I've used"", ""I had been using iPhone for the last 10 years and never able to get out from ios ecosystem. Thank to Genius bar employees who refused to fix my phone (11 pro max) and macbook even if it was manufacture problem. Great, then I found this p30 pro.1. fingerprint unlock is extremely great. It's super useful during pandemic. You can still unlock with wet fingers2. facial unlock is great3. Camera is the king. Much better than iphone 11 pro max. Especially the night mode, which is significantly clearer.4. Smooth UI, very similar with IOS, I dont have trouble to switch as iphone user. Instead, it's smoothier.5. It's cheap.

Para muchos el precio de arriba de 22000 no justifica su compra, pero sabiendo que otras marcas ofrecen menos innovaciones por más dinero, es cuando puedes saber que estás pagando lo justo o incluso menos, ya que aproveché una repentina bajada de precio del teléfono y además de que te regalan otro celular, el precio es accesible, insisto, para la gama premium que es. Lo único que debería mejorar es la cámara para selfies (el pixel 3XL es el rey en mi punto de vista) y tal vez Android Stock para quitar la capa de personalización o pulirla como ha hecho Samsung con su Obra UI. De ahí en fuera, todo lo demás es perfecto. Lo mejor, la batería, la carga rápida, el diseño, la cámara principal con el zoom (sí es posible captar la Luna) y el desempeño.']"

Vor allem für die Fotografie fand ich es sehr gut. Auch der Fingerabdruck-Scanner war das beste, was ich bisher bei Tablets und Smartphones erlebt habe. Insgesamt ein ausgezeichnetes Gesamtpaket, das trotz Flaggship-Ambitionen auch preislich noch unter der Konkurrenz blieb.Schon länger stand das Nachfolgemodell P30 Pro auf meiner Wunschliste, da vor allem die Kamera lt. Tests und den technischen Daten noch mehr bietet. Ich habe nach guten Angeboten gesucht und bin, wie schon oft, bei Amazon auf das m.E. beste Angebot gestoßen. Nicht das aller billigste, aber mit eine ausgezeichneten Preis-Leistungsverhältnis, wo ich mich auch auf die Garantie verlassen kann und ein wirklich unbenutztes Gerät bekomme.Die Verpackung ist Huawei typisch ein robuster und relativ kompakter, weißer Karton, in dem oben das Smartphone in einer  schützenden Hülle liegt. Darunter befindet sich ein Fach, in dem sich die Unterlagen und der kleine Schlüssel für das SIM-Fach befinden. Ganz untern findet man das Ladegerät, das passende Kabel und einen Ohrhörer, der mit dem USB-C-Anschluss verbunden wird. Eine Schutzhülle wird, leider nicht mehr mit geliefert. Also sollte man unbedingt daran denken, eine zu bestellen, da das Gehäuse sehr empfindlich ist.Nach dem Auspacken hält man einen ziemlichen Brocken in der Hand, der allerdings eine wertigen und sehr eleganten Eindruck hinterlässt. Hier punktet das P30 Pro deutlich gegenüber seinem Vorgänger. Das Display hat gerundete Ränder. Da fühlt sich gut an und sieht auch edel aus. Nachteil ist definitiv, dass es so nicht mehr durch die überstehenden Ränder einer Hülle komplette geschützt werden kann und somit mehr gefährdet ist.Der Umstieg auf das neue Phone ist relativ simpel erledigt. Wie üblich wird/werden die SIM-Kart(n) in die Schublade eingelegt. Danach startet man die Installation und folgt den Anweisungen bzgl. Sprache, WLan etc. Mit der App ""Phone clone"" von Huawei werden dann praktisch die ganzen Daten und Einstellungen des Vorgängers auf das neue Gerät übertragen. Lediglich bei einigen wenigen Apps (Bank, Mail, etc.) muss noch nach installiert werden und/oder ggf. die Zugangsdaten neu eingegeben werden.Das Display ist noch größer als das des Vorgängers. Die Farben sind brillant und leuchtend. Es versteht sich natürlich  von selber, dass das Display aus jedem Blickwinkel perfekt darstellt. Die Geschwindigkeit ist sehr hoch. Alle Apps starten ohne merkliche Verzögerung. Wie der Vorgänger hält eine Akkuladung bei meiner Nutzung trotz höherer Leistung gute 2 Tage.Jetzt komme ich zum meinem Hauptaugenmerk, der Kamera, die jetzt aus vier einzelnen Objektiven besteht, die in Zusammenarbeit mit LEICA entwickelt wurden: der 40-Megapixel-Hauptkamera, einer 8-Megapixel-Teleskop-Linse für den Zoom, einer Time-of-Flight-Linse für Tiefendetails und einer 20-Megapixel-Linse für Ultraweitwinkel-Aufnahmen. Ich war schon vom Vorgängermodell sehr beeindruckt. Mit dem P30 Pro wurde aber eine neue Dimension erreicht. Der Zoom bietet jetzt 10fache Vergrößerung und auch bei schlechten Lichtverhältnissen sind die Aufnahmen nochmal besser geworden. Ich fotografiere normaler Weise mit LUMIX-Kameras (DC-G9 und DC-GX9), die neben den normalen LUMIX-Objektiven auch mit einigen LEICA-Objektiven betrieben werden. Aber immer öfters springt das Smartphone ein, wenn es unterwegs Motive gibt, bei denen man keine Zeit für längere Belichtungszeiten hat oder die mal schnell mit genommen werden. Der große Vorteil der ""echten"" Kameras lag bisher gerade im Tele-Bereich. Hier hat das P30 Pro kräftig aufgeholt und kommt von der Bildqualität schon erschreckend nahe an die Kameras heran. Wohl gemerkt, ich werde die Kameras natürlich weiterhin nutzen, weil sie in vielen Bereichen einfach noch mehr aus dem Bildern heraus holen können, aber das Huawei P30 Pro rückt auf und für Bilder, die im Internet veröffentlicht werden sollen, reicht die Qualität absolut aus.Und? Bin ich jetzt zufrieden mit dem ""Neuen""? Im Prinzip ja. Es ist dem Vorgänger in fast allen Punkten deutlich überlegen und leider auch wieder größer geworden. Lediglich beim Fingerabdruck-Sensor ist der Vorgänger eindeutig schneller und fehlerfreier. Der Sensor der P30 Pro ist auf das Display gewandert und reagiert deutlich träger. Auch hat es schon einige wenige Fehlmessungen gegeben, nach denen man den Finger zum Anmelden erneut auflegen muss. Das ist zwar Jammern auf sehr hohem Niveau, aber es fällt auf. Ansonsten kann ich nur sagen, dass ich den Kauf auf keinen Fall bereue und dieses Smartphone gerade für Menschen, die Wert auf gute Fotos legen, empfehlen kann.', 'Non sono un\'esperta di telefoni e non compro spesso online. Avevo molta paura a spendere così tanti soldi su Amazon, ma come sempre non mi ha delusa. Il telefono è arrivato in condizioni perfette. Tra l\'altro avevo visto tra le recensioni che alcuni avevano ricevuto il colore ""breathing crystal"", che desideravo, ma non era selezionabile tra le opzioni, ho contattato il venditore il quale non mi ha risposto, per cui avevo perso le speranze, ma quando è arrivato, il colore era quello, me ne sono innamorata. Il telefono è veloce, efficiente, la batteria dura una giornata intera dopo un utilizzo intensivo, arrivando alla sera (non mi è mai capitato in mesi di utilizzo di rimanere senza batteria), la ricarica è velocissima, le foto sono pazzesche. Avevo letto tra le recensioni che per alcuni il telefono era troppo grande, ma io non sono d\'accordo, in tasca entra perfettamente, riesco a tenerlo con una mano e a digitare in tutti i punti dello schermo (tranne l\'angolino in alto a sinistra, per il quale sposto semplicemente la mano, non è affatto un problema). Per me, e per l\'utilizzo che ne faccio, è perfetto, lo adoro.

I could have had the battery replaced by a tech for $55, but decided to treat myself to a slight upgrade. I was very happy with the Mate SE, so I went to Youtube for reviews of Huawei phones. After seeing a number of very favorable reviews of the P30 Lite, I ordered this phone late last Saturday, and received it the following Monday.I had debated spending $500 or more for a ""high end"" phone, but learned a lot of the technology in more expensive phones is dedicated to photo-taking technology. I\'m not a selfie-addict, so I let common sense take over, and opted for a phone in the $300 range (I found a vendor that sold this phone for $259, and 2 day  delivery- I didn\'t want to wait a week in the event my old phone died).The phone comes with the described accessories- USB-C cord, screen protector, charging brick, and a very thin, rubberized case. The phone is very sleek and slippery. I\'d suggest putting the case on immediately, so it doesn\'t slide out of your hand. I originally placed it on a glass table top, and it slid all over the place.The phone has a massive 128 gig internal storage capacity. I put a 128 gig SD card in the 2nd slot. I can\'t imagine what I\'d fill the phone with, but I think most of us have discovered over time that we tend to fill our phones up with pics and music. I\'ll have plenty of room to download Netflix vids to watch when I\'m on a treadmill.Out of the box, the phone was charged to about 56%, and was loaded with Android version 9.The on speaker at the bottom is very loud. I tend to link to a bluetooth speaker or headphones for music and videos anyway. I haven\'t tried a phonecall on speakerphone yet.The phone seems only able to pick-up the 2.5 Ghz channel on your wireless network.Exporting all my apps and settings from my old phone to the P-30 was almost seamless, using Huawei\'s Phone Clone app (you can obtain it in the Google Play Store, for your old phone). This turns both phones into hotspots, and you keep both phones close to each other, and 99% of my apps and settings were exported.By default, ALL your apps will be displayed over multiple screens. I thought I would have to spend hours arranging my apps, but discovered the setting (see attached pic) for ""Home screen style"" under Settings>Home screen & Wallpaper>Home Screen Style> then select the bottom choice, ""Drawer."" This brought almost all my app icons I had from my old phone, where I nested similar apps in their own ""drawers"" labeled ""music,"" ""tools,\' etc. This saved me HOURS of work. All your apps will now be in a drawer that looks like a circle with 3 rows of 3 dots. You can then drag whatever apps out, and align them how you wish. If you drag one app into another, you create a- I think they\'re called ""drawers"" which you can then label. This helps categorize apps.""Ease of use"" is relative. If you\'re new to the Android world, going through all the settings can be daunting, and there\'s LOTS of settings under the hood. I\'m still discovering many. I appreciate built-in apps, like App Lock, which enables you to protect your apps like email, and banking by preventing use by other people. You unlock the app either by your fingerprint, or passcode.I enabled fingerprint and facial recognition to unlock the phone. The responsiveness is instantaneous. One trick with the fingerprint scanner on the rear of the phone: when looking at pictures, you can use a finger to swipe to the next picture, so you can view a gallery of of photos with one hand, instead of two.There is a notch at the top of the phone, which can be hidden via settings.I find the camera much faster than my old phone, and more variety in how to take take photos. The photos are crisp, and capture colors fairly accurately. Are they iPhone quality pics? No. The camera isn\'t a big deal for me, but it\'s nice to have a camera that takes good quality photos. The digital zoom works very well. Sending pics via MMS seem fine to me, unlike another reviewer.There\'s no native internet calling feature, but there\'s 3rd party apps that support that (but you will be issued a new phone number).Scrolling is fast and smooth.I found one little quirk: When viewing Youtube, the video is about 20% smaller than the screen. You can go fullscreen using your thumb and forefinger to stretch to fullscreen. It may be a power saving feature; I\'m not sure.Huawei is known for its extremely long power use. You\'ll have to experiment in Settings to find the one right power setting for you.There\'s plenty more features to be discovered, but at this price point, this phone is a winner.', 'Ottimo telefono, arrivato nei tempi previsti.', 'Bonjour,Je suis très satisfait de ce produit !Bien cordialement,Mr NIASSE', 'Muy buen aparato llegó rapido', ""Performs great.

Comparing online the Samsung S8/S9/S10 and other brands from China. Seeing that I have owned Samsung from the S3 I am partial to the brand as it has always done well for me. I needed a phone in the US to function with two SIM cards simultaneously, one for work one for home, without having two completely different cell phones. I should also say, that I was not interested in an Apple Device.  The carrier that both of my SIM cards uses is ATT. At the time of purchase, ATT does not carry a Samsung device in the US that offers a dual SIM capability.In the Box (factory sealed with intact seal):- Galaxy S10 (SM-G973F)- AKG wired headphones w/mic- US wall plug w/USB C cord (charger)- Pre-installed screen protector (brand unknown as it was already on the phone)- Clear plastic case (brand unknown, and offers minimal protection)- 128GB SD Card (not able to use internal to the phone due to my need for 2 seperate SIM cards)- USB C Male to standard USB female adapter (use for data transfer and/or keyboard/mouse capabilities)- Informational material specific to the phone- Internal SIM card holder with dual functionality (Can hold 2 micro SIM Cards or 1 micro SIM and one SD Card)Initial power on and setup:- Battery was 50% +/- charged- Initial power up was in another language, however a drop down menu on the initial screen offered English (Canada). This option was selected and found to be what as needed for proceeding with US setup- Effortless data transfer from Samsung S8 to S10 using Samsung Smart Switch.- The ATT SIM card was plug and play, no additional setup was needed other than inserting the SIM into the phone.Initial impressions/functions of S10:- Dual SIM capability (yes, both are physical SIM cards (no eSIM)- Wireless charging (Yes)- Headphone jack (Yes)- 3 main rear cameras and 1 front camera (all function very well)- Hidden fingerprint scanner (works well)- Facial recognition (works really well, I no longer need to use my fingerprint unless I am in very low light conditions)- Bixby, (another ""helper"" akin to Alexa, Google, etc. I was never really a fan of my phone talking to me, so this will probably be more of a toy than a feature for me personally. However, there is a dedicated button on the left hand side for Bixby. This button can be customized with a tap or double tap for an additional quick launch of an app. I chose a single tap for my camera.- Other interesting, helpful, gimmicky, etc function on the phone. Some are great and add well to the phone. Others, I simply disabled or hid.Dual SIM: The real reason I purchased the phone.- I will start by saying that this international version of the S10 was EXACTLY what I was hoping for in a cell phone.- Two separate physical ATT SIM cards are being used.- On the phone screen I am able to see signal strength for both SIM cards- I am able to set a default SIM card for: 1) Phone Calls, 2) Text, 3) Data. This is done easily with a swipe down from the top of the screen and shown directly below the primary settings (such as WiFi, GPS, BlueTooth, etc.)- However, default does not mean that the ""secondary"" SIM is in standby.- When making calls, I am given the option of easily calling from SIM 1 or SIM 2 (which can also be identified with different symbols rather than numbers, such as a home symbol and work symbol).- When texting, I am given the option of easily sending from SIM 1 or SIM 2, same things with the symbols.- When using data, the phone uses the default setting that was chosen by the user.- The phone is able to receive calls for both phone numbers without having to change settings.- All in all, I am very impressed with the intuitiveness of the design, capability, and ease of use with the dual SIM functionality.Overall Impression:With everything from purchase cost, minimal wait time for delivery, setup, use, and functionality I am very impressed. At this time, there is not a single thing about the phone where I would say ""this could be better"". I will say that I am not a gamer, thus the phone will not be used for them. I cannot comment on how well it would be used for games. I do take many pictures than range from people to panoramic vista views of National Parks and the phone is used as my main daily use camera. Samsung has never let me down in this area.

Initially, I was a little wary of purchasing this phone online as I was always under the assumption that you had to buy one from the vendors or reputable telecom providers, and seeing this online at an absolute bargain, had me thinking. So after a few days deliberating about buying it, I bought it and it has been an absolute steal considering companies like Carphone warehouse are maybe charging £200-£300+ more! Also, the estimate delivery date was approx.. 2-3 weeks, but to my surprise, it arrived within a few days!For tech-savvy people who actually care, it is worth noting (in my case) it contains the Exynos processor which I believe is standard for UK models. Consequently, not the Snapdragon processor (which is supposedly faster and used in international models), but I was not buying the phone purely for this reason, so couldn't care less.But all in all, I have had the phone a few months now and have not encountered any problems what so ever - just buy it and save your self the money!"", 'I have been using my iPhone SE for three years and I needed an upgrade.

The setup is simple and easy. I live in the US and my SIM card worked fine. I use family mobile at Walmart and it works well with the phone. I only see minor glitches like the screen will be slow sometimes and I think it is because I switch browsers a lot. I think that glitches are normal though because I use a new iPhone X at work and the apps crash all the time. Overall super happy with my new phone. I wish the charger was more effective though.

My only two cons are the battery life draining a little quicker than I like for a new phone (I feel like Androids in general are just like this) and the fingerprint scanner and face recognition being a tad slow (it's my first time having a phone with biometrics, and its slow to me). Other than that I don't regret buying this."", 'Slightly disappointed to receive the Exynos powered version rather than the slightly more powerful Snapdragon 855.  The phone itself though is fast just not as fast as it could have been.  Battery life is fine and doesn\'t seem to suffer from the ""hang-up"" bug some of the early review units had (didn\'t return to low power mode after a call unless you rebooted) .', ""This is a really nice phone, the quality of the camera is amazing. I just have a feeling that the phone was not new. I gave it 3 stars because the seal broken, and the phone was already set up which is weird, as all the phones I've purchased always required charging and set up. Not so sure if it's new or not, apart from that it is a great phone.Update:  I have been having trouble with my phone and it hasn't even been a month. the screen sticks, keyboard won't come up. Have to go to home screen, close apps and reopen app. Also, i like always being able to view the time with always on display,  the time cuts off almost as if the screen  is malfunctioning. I am a bit disappointed after spending so much money on a phone. To early to be experiencing problems"", ""Overall super happy with the phone. I'd had either lost or had my S9+ stolen on a 24 hour YOLO bachelor party and was in need of a replacement. At first was looking into a refreshed S9+ but then was like wtf, why not just look into an S10. Specs looked great and phone was sexy as hell. S10 was pretty much as big the old S9+ but lighter. Saved even more buying the International version vs a refurb one from the States. Everything works great. Most people wouldn't know or care about the difference in chip performance. Get this Internation version!"", 'The phone is great. There is lot to love about s10. Super fast. In-display ultrasonic fingerprint is not fast as optical fingerprint sensors but it will get better by time as it is a new technology. One thing i am not satisfied with is selfie camera performance on low light. There is no major improvement whatsoever over its previous generations. I usually do not take many selfies; so it is not a big issue for me but if you do, consider this. Other than that i have not had any problems. It works pretty well. Sound is amazing. Screen is amazing. Customization is everything']"

Notably improved over the s9+.  Sensitivity to changes in skin cause fingerprint reader to not recognize imprint.  Wash your hands, use a lotion, get dry skin from working in the yard; doesn't matter, any subtle change to the skin from when you scanned it seems to interfere with the function.  Safe, I guess, but annoying.  I've tried two separate fingers and thumbs; I've tried rescanning 2 times since, but it is only a 2:3 chance at best that it will work for me.  Probably good for security, because I can use it for financial account log-ins.  But generally, just don't forget your pattern, and all is well.I've also noted some hang time on some apps while functioning.  Have not been able to determine cause--could be McAfee security software, which is intrusive, even on laptops (my opinion).I use the dual chip functionality, but find the chip disengages after awhile of nonuse.  I have to pop the tray and reset it for the chip to reengage.  Quite annoying.  Don't know if it is unique to my phone, or if it is unique to the particular service chip I use from Ukraine.  When in Ukraine or other countries, it seems to stay engaged, so it must be something in the USA network that cuts it off.The positives--the battery gets me through the day -- the model s10 has a smaller battery than the s9, and was totally inadequate, even for moderate use.  Had to return it.  The s10+ seems smaller than it is.  I find it easier to manage than te s9+, though specs say it is bigger; but, doesn't feel like it.  Phone comes with a good clear cover that has protected my phone on more than a couple of drops, despite its thin profile (which I love).  Fast charge is great.  Camera, I don't use as much as I could, but it has many new features that can provide more refined photots, but it takes time to learn how and when to use them, just like any device."", 'Excelente Equipo... ahora, con las actualizaciones del sistema ah tenido algunos fallos de software en la Cámara, y en apps como Samsung cloud, Samsung carpeta privada y otras, además de que se ah vuelto muy lento.

It beats my A30 thats for sure and thats all what matters. The screen size resembles the A30 and I love the pill cut out, I barely notice it because I don't focus on the rifht side of the screen much because my right eye is my lazy eye so I dont focus much on that side but when I look at it its beautiful to have a full screen display which is also terrific."", 'El teléfono llegó en tiempo y forma, con el cargador nacional, así como el Software para México, por lo que se puede usar Samsung Pay sin problemas.La pantalla es de lo mejor que hay en teléfonos, tiene un buen brillo y la definición y nitidez es de lo mejor que hay en estos momentos.La cámara aunque no es la mejor que hay en el mercado es bastante buena y funciona de maravilla.El reconocimiento facial es es algo deficiente, pero funciona la mayoría del tiempo, es un aspecto que podría mejorar.El Software ,no termina de agradarme porque el dispositivo tiene demasiadas características que muy probablemente no uses y termina consumiendo un montón de RAM, además no hay forma cómoda de bloquear las aplicaciones con S Secure, como en otras versiones. En su lugar se usa el Secure Folder, pero no termina de agradarme.En general un buen producto si estás buscando un gama alta a un precio menor de 20,000.', 'Battery life is as expected from the modern phones. If you use it a lot you need to charge it a lot. I can likely get a day out of it on a single charge if I use it sparingly. I ha e tried cheaper phones In the past and I can only say that you get what you pay for... The discount is not worth the hassle with cheaper brands and lower models.', 'My niece and I love this phone (we both have one) we have been using it for about three weeks now and it is amazing. There is one thing that I do not like with this phone and that is the absence of the Samsung radio app. I upgraded from the Samsung A8 Plus and prior to that I had an S4 Mini. Both were international unlocked phones and both came with the regular AM/FM radio app (uses the headphones as the antena). I was surprised to find that the version of the S10 Plus that I have - Exynos version - does not come with this type of radio installed. I personally do not like the internet radio apps or at least would have preferred to have the chance to choose.  Another gripe I have is the fact that although this phone is a dual sims phone, you have to choose between the extra sim card or your SD card. The A8 Plus had two dedicated sim card slots and the SD card slot.  Lastly a very minor gripe is the reduced length of the USB-C cable. The S10 Plus it is 38 inches while the one for my old Samsung A8 Plus it is 46 or 48 inches.', ""Upgraded from the Note8 to this phone, the S10+, and I really enjoy using it. Transition was seamless, and the experience of usage is great and what you would expect of a flagship. The camera quality, and capabilities, are great. I actually enjoy using this phone more than my usage of my Note8. Definitely recommend the upgrade if you are on an 8th generation or earlier.Box came with serial number stickers, charging block (European connection), USB-C cable, USB-C to USB-A adapter, AKG headphones, a clear case, and paperwork. I did not put on the case on or use it at all, but I would say that it would only be good for small bumps and scratches, definitely not drops.I have purchased two cases, the Spigen Rugged Armor (thin protective case) and an Encased belt clip designed for that case (which is a nice combination). The second case I purchased is the Otterbox Defender, which I haven't received or used yet, but I'm looking forward to using it based on the reviews of others on YouTube.Incase you are wondering, it is the real thing, came to me brand new in the plastic wrap, with the Samsung manufacturer's seal unbroken."", '*I had to return the phone due to ""missing parts and/or accessories"" but got another one directly from samsung.*Overall, this phone is amazing. My previous phone was a galaxy s8+ and this is very much an upgrade. The battery life is amazing, the cameras are super nice especially the ultra wide angle. The screen is really bright and the image is really nice.This phone is full of cool features. The in-screen fingerprint is really usefull. Its quite fast once you get used to it\'s location. Another great feature is power sharing. I own samsung\'s wireless ear buds and the wireless power sharing from the s10+ makes it very convenient to charge them.I could go on about what I like about the s10+ because there is nothing I dont like about it!A heavy price but in my opinion, its well worth it', ""I can not stress to someone who is thinking about purchasing this phone, how much I absolutely love mine! This is hands down, the best phone I've ever had. This is a little strange of Samsung because they are dabbling with technology in this phone that really hasn't been used ever so there are some kinks. For instance, the fingerprint reader is not the best in the world, they honestly would have been better off with an optical in-screen scanner like the ones on the oneplus 6T in my opinion. The facial recognition isnt the greatest but it's very decent. I understand they had to sacrifice hefty more accurate components for more screen real estate and that is honestly a sacrifice I'm willing to make. This phone is the fastest peace of technology I've ever seen, its ridiculous. Snap 855 and 8gb of ram, you cant beat it! I enjoy the attempts at pursuing new tech and this phone to me, is an embodiment of that. I hope the tech gets better, but I won't see it for another 5 years at this price!""]"

My dad has the same phone, but his model works fine. Go figure."", 'I initially had concerns about buying an imported phone, wondering if it would work the same as one I bought in the UK etc.  In short, yes it does definitely consider this.At the time of my purchase this phone was retailing at £799 and I bought it here for £572, opting for green because it was cheaper and would be hidden by a case anyway.It was given a estimated delivery of 1 - 2 weeks, however it was with me in 5 days from America!The tracking says the phone was posted in New York and on arrival it is clearly a genuine S10, sealed in its original box.  It came with an additional UK plug outside the box as the one in the box is a USA charger.Of note your old Samsung chargers will work perfectly with this, just buy some ""USB C"" cables online to plug into your existing plugs as that is the type of wire to fit this phone.Also worth noting is it comes with a factory fitted screen cover, soft plastic TPU case and the one I got came with a free 128GB Micro SD card.I presume it came from Latin America originally as on booting up the phone and inserting the SIM it asked me to confirm my provider in Spanish.  Don\'t worry though, this is the only Spanish you will see and it\'s really easy to see your SIM provider, eg Three in my case.Once you\'ve clicked that, it automatically detects your language and switches to English forever more.Also worth noting, after some concerns I read online, is it contains a Exynos processor which is the same as UK phones.  (The USA and China have Snapdragon processors which are supposed to be ever so sightly faster) Samsung Pay also works perfectly.I hope this helps you save some cash and get a decent phone.  I would also recommend spending a bit more on a decent case to protect your phone, like a Spigen case.', ""So I ordered this Samsung Galaxy S10 (Model SM-G973F/DS) on the 15th July 2019 with a delivery date of 19 -23 July 2019 but despite that I got it two days earlier which I'm so impressed with that I wanted to start my review straight away.The phone came in a sealed box and although the charging plug in the sealed box is a European 2 pin plug a UK three pin plug was included separately in the same package so that's great.  The phone has a 43% charge at the moment so I'm in the provcess of charging it now and will update this review once I have more information and can honestly review the Battery Life, Fingerprint reader and Face Recognition.So here we are 24th July and phone used 24/7 i.e. bedside alarm clock and and on charge overnight. I use my phone to record everything really including work calendar, work and personal WhatsApp Messaging, online banking, news reading and with my volume of use I think the battery could last 2 days...... almost, without charge.Fingerprint reader is excellent successfully reading on first scan most of the time.I can't comment on the facial recognition because I believe that that type of security is not that secure so will not be using it.Really like it so far and buying saved me nearly £300 when compared to what I regard as mostly overpriced contract options."", 'I purchased this phone in July 2023. I gradually realized that it seemed to have a microphone issue. When I need to make or receive phone calls, I have to use headphones or press the speaker button so that I can be heard. I can not have sensitive work calls on speaker phone, while in public.  On the occasions I have a conversation on speaker, there are noisy interferences heard in the background. The seller was contacted around a month after the purchase. This was the reply: ""Even though the phone is new, it is still old. The S10 has not been manufactured since 2020."" Now the battery life doesn\'t last long. They offered a warranty card, which I received. I contacted the seller to return the phone to the company, and I was told that I have to go through the warranty company for further directions. When I enter the warranty details online as instructed, I am told that the warranty number is invalid. As the phone is 3 years old, I would understand outdated apps, not faulty basic functions for calling. This company has not been helpful in resolving the issue. I would not recommend it.', ""This is a Genuine Samsung Galaxy S10 and the sender communication over the product is really good.The OEM Samsung seal for the box had been removed and resealed with a different, larger seal/sticker and the phone started up in French, but it is simple enough to chose your sim for the phone to factory reset to your country (I'm on a UK network and it acted as it should). The phone was untouched, unmarked, had 33% battery, everything was present including a UK charger plug packaged separately to the main phone (but in the same overall parcel package).As mentioned in another review, you would be silly not to buy this product for such a price where you'd be spending minimum £699 from a UK retail store (plus you get the European adaptions too).It's been working good and fine for the last few weeks so I am content with this product. I hope my review helps you make an informed decision."", ""I'm going on a cruise shortly. I have an s8 but wanted to upgrade for a better camera. I ordered at 3pm and received by 11am the next day. This model came from the south american market and booted in Spanish but was quick and easy to set up in English.  The instructions were in Spanish and not available in English but this was not a problem.  I had Samsung and Google backups so my phone was quickly up and running and as familiar as my old phone. I am very pleased. It came unlocked and factory sealed.

The problem may be the Exymos chip used on this model instead of the more superior snapdragon 855 used in US & China model- occasionally stutters when trying to launch apps, something I never experienced with my previous oneplus 3T phoneI kinda wish I bought the Oppo Reno instead but oh well just gonna have to tolerate the flaws of owning a mass produced & heavily advertised device."", ""Before this I had the Samsung Galaxy S7 in fact I had three of them because I like that model so much I still kind of like it the best but this new phone is good too I just think it cost way too much money I don't need all those cameras I just have a cat to take pictures of LOL otherwise though it is a good phone I miss the touchable home button that you can actually feel that's a biggie for me plus I wish there were more explanation about Bixby.

But my wife did upgrade to the Mi9 from her S7 a month before I upgraded to the S10+.By comparison, considering how cheap the Mi9 was, some things show up the S10+. The most obvious is the fingerprint reader - my wife has a thick glass screen protector on her phone and its in-screen reader has never missed a beat. My S10+ with just a thin film is good enough but not as good as hers, and there are no glass screen protectors for the S10+ that don\'t stop its reader working. My annoying Bixby button can\'t be used for anything else, her Google Home button can be reconfigured. And so on.All in all, the S10+ *is* a good phone and if you want a recognised brand and decent UK support it is hard to beat. But it *does* have competition if you\'re prepared to look outside the big names, and at anything up to twice the price for a similar spec the S10+ isn\'t ""awesome"".', ""Anyone buying this phone should be aware of two fairly obvious points:1. It is not the U.S. model, so it has the Exynos chipset instead of Snapdragon, but that's the only option if you want dual-sim.2. As it is not the U.S. model, Samsung Pay will not work unless you happen to be in the same country/region for which the device was made and have a bank account there. Google Pay should work as an alternative, if you live/have a bank account in one of the 28 covered countries.I wanted the dual-sim version and while I am from the U.S. I live in a country not covered by Samsung Pay, so these points were not dealbreakers. In benchmarks, Snapdragon always beats Exynos, but for regular phone users Exynos is more than sufficiently powerful and fast. The phone is definitely brand new but the package is opened to remove the region lock.The phone I received is apparently from the UAE, but it works fine on GSM networks in the U.S. in Europe. In the U.S. I used T-Mobile and had no issues on 4G/LTE. Indoor reception is not always ideal, but having previously owned Samsung phones, this seems to be a persistent issue for the company. The in-screen fingerprint reader is very good, but removing the included screen protector greatly improves the response. Face recognition is absolutely flawless.The only issue I have with this particular purchase is that included power adapter is a UK 3-pin and no U.S. or EU plug adapter is included."", ""I really like this phone for the most part.

I have a bunch of pics and video etc.. and this phone is not bogged down by it...  The other issue I had with it was the chargers were not for use in the states.. Not that big of a deal though I already had a wireless charger and that is all I have needed.

Yesterday I used it from 8am until Noon, setting it up and finding the features. At Noon the battery was down to 50%. Ran it down to 20% then plugged it in.  Left in the ""screen off"" setting over night. Right now at 10am, it\'s at 53%. I bought this phone because of the larger battery (3900 ma) capacity. Just sent back a Motorola G7 because I felt that the Galaxy A50 had better battery life, but it isn\'t starting out that way.The icons look too simplistic and cartoonish. The fingerprinter reader is a joke. I have set it up twice, and it never unlocks the phone, so I have removed all security sign in options.The network symbol shows ""LTE"" but not sure if it is 4G. Researching 4G, there really isn\'t any actual 4G networks, but the name ""4GLTE"" is what most cell phone carriers claim to trick people into thinking they are getting a 4G network.Going to give this phone a few more days of trial, but I think I will be sending it back and getting the Moto G7 again. That phone seems more ""mid"" range than this one. I will say the camera picture quality is good. Not so sure this is a better phone than the Motorola G7, but I will find out in a few days.The Samsung bloatware isn\'t useful at all.  In fact,  it\'s confusing and cumbersome.  On my Moto phone,  I could download files directly to my Onedrive account.  Not even an option. Have to download files to phone!After 2 weeks of use,  the battery isn\'t much better than the Moto 7 I returned to buy this.  I got a free Moto G6 with the purchase of the G7, thinking I might be returning this and going back.UPDATE:April 13th, 2020. I like the way the phone looks, if you don\'t charge it too often, the battery lasts most of the day, so I would say it is a bit better than my previous Motorola Moto G5 for battery. The only thing that bothers me is the lock screen, using Biometrics(face or finger prints) isn\'t always useful to unlock the screen. For the money, this phone is worth it. Don\'t worry about the ""international"" version. I live north of Detroit and use T-Mobile and I haven\'t had any connection issues. I just bought a Samsung 55 Q60 television and I use my phone as a remote control.', 'A great mid-range device with decent performance, nice screen, and excellent battery life. Has all the essential features that you would need on a smartphone without breaking the bank. For normal smartphone activities such as browsing and social media it does not feel slow or laggy at all and the battery is able to last 2 days even with a good amount of usage. Calls are nice and clear, the speaker is loud and sounds pretty good. Samsung\'s One UI really impressed me by how much it has improved drastically from their TouchWiz days in terms of usability and performance. There is still a bit of bloatware (but not much by any stretch) and it still looks a bit cartoony, but functionally works very well.Although I guess it is ""average"" size for a phone these days, it is a bit big for me, unfortunately that seems to be the way phone manufacturers are heading. The in-screen fingerprint sensor is OK but still nowhere near as good as a dedicated one, especially with a screen protector or dirty hands, kind of a gimmick. The obvious corner cut in the A50 to get the price down though is the camera, images are kind of blurry and washed out, below average for a midrange device, especially one that is above average on the midrange price scale.Overall though, not a deal breaker for someone who is looking for specifically a Samsung in this price range if that\'s what you\'re used to and prefer the familiar UI.', 'Battery life is good, charges fast with included charger. Screen is bright and clear with vivid colors. Worked fine on AT&T with SIM card, didn\'t have to go into the store since it was the same size card as my last phone. This phone is fast enough to play games I enjoy such as Hearthstone and Empires and Puzzles, although those games will draw power from the battery faster as with any phone really.The unexpected thing for me was how nice the camera was! There is a wide angle feature which lets you take REALLY wide photos which is useful sometimes, and there is a ""live focus"" or something camera setting where you can control the background blur and effects after taking the image. The video is good too.You can\'t use wifi and make this a hotspot at the same time, but that isn\'t an issue for me usually.The fingerprint sensor is a little picky sometimes, I haven\'t tried the face sensor.Overall this phone feels like an excellent deal given the price compared to other phones, calls are clear and easy to hear, speaker phone works as expected.There isn\'t a lot of extra junk on it which is nice too.  There is this one default ""Bixby screen"" that was annoying me at first, but it is easy to disable, just hold down a finger on a blank area, swipe over to it, and turn it off on the top with a power button looking toggle.', ""It works. I can't stand the low processing power and had to to mainstream with the galaxy phones. The lag on menus and changing apps made it irritating to use"", ""EDIT: Samsung just released an update for the A50, and I haven't had problems with the fingerprint reader since. Out of probably the twenty or so times I've unlocked it so far in the past few days, it hasn't given an error once. The fingerprint reader is so much more reliable now, and it's faster, too.For less than $300 the A50 is an amazing phone. The camera is great (especially in low-light settings), it's fast, it looks good, and it comes with a case and glass screen protector. It doesn't have the build quality of a flagship phone but that's to be expected.The fingerprint reader is my biggest gripe. Assuming your fingers are perfectly clean it works about 80% of the time, but if you're like me where your hands get dirty at your job good luck getting it to work once. There's always some form of grit stuck to my fingers and the fingerprint reader just can't recognize them, even after I wash them.My only other problems are just small things I miss from my LG V20. Double tap to lock the phone and front-facing light/distance sensors that keep the screen from waking up when you don't want it to aren't present on this phone, but they're not that big of an issue."", ""So far I enjoy the upgrade from my previous Android phone (about 2 months of use). Good speed, battery life, and resolution. Two things make this phone difficult to use:-the face recognition does not work well in darkness, and sometimes even in brightness is not the best-the fingerprint reader is very lacklustre; you have to position your finger perfectly and even then it doesn't always work.As a result of these last two it can take a while to unlock the phone if you use fingerprint/face recognition. My old phone with a dedicated fingerprint reader (this one is built into the screen) was much more reliable."", ""This phone is amazing!!! I love the size of the screen and the quality of the screen. It takes great pictures, which is what I was looking for in particular. The price point is also super good which is a huge plus. I have had zero issues with this phone so far. I read that some people had issues with the fingerprint reader but I just use the password code instead. I haven't acctually tried the fingerprint reader because I prefer the code. Another plus is, this phone charges super fast and retains battery life very well. Better than any other phone I've had acctually and I've had quite a few. I highly recommend this phone. It also comes with a screen protector already on it. I bought a nice clear case off of amazon as well because I like the pearly white colour of the phone."", 'I love the Dual SIM functionality. Camera is awesome. Screen is very large.I have AT&T and it works on their network.I also have SaskTel in Canada on SIM2 and confirm it works aswell.The only issue I had was it was not able to read the SIM data. So changes in Call forwarding had to be done through AT&T. Otherwise No issues among connectivity.I give this phone a 5 of 5. Its certainly reliable. Easy to use. And the battery life is really good aswell. I have no complaints.For the price point. And for a phone with a factory unlocked firmware. Its a definite must have.I dont use all the features. But for me. Its good enough.I will never buy a phone from another carrier again. Even for an international version. I can bear not having the SIM data settings.Worth every dollar spent.', ""So I've had this phone for around 2 months and it hasn't let me down. Its sleek design catches the eyes of peers, it's battery is enough to last a teenager a day's use and its camera catches almost everything (almost). The only thing that doesn't butter my bread is that the phone tends to be sluggish here and there, but not enough to make me slam the phone into the ground at 50mph. The fingerprint scanner sucks butt, but that might just be me, cool feature but something I don't rely on. But the phone itself definitely makes up for it with all its other features."", 'When purchasing a mid range phone there are lots of pros and cons. Specs are available anywhere so I’ll just get down to my own experience.I purchased my phone close to 2020, I’m still using it. For most of its life its has been in a case. Battery life has began to get worst over time I can get just about 15 hrs of usage and more with battery saver on.The fingerprint sensor is quite terrible. That’s all I’ll say on that.After deciding to take my phone out of its case I the adhesive holding the unremovable back over slowly peeled from holding the phone itself.It was a nice midrange phone, looking to upgrade soon in 2022.']"

Preis is jetzt vertretbar für das S10.Funktioniert gut, Android Updates installiert und aktuell (das wichtigste Kriterium).Positiv:* Kamera - tolle Bilder* Bildschirm - klar and sehr hell* Geschwindigkeit - das Exynos-Prozessor ist mehr als schnell genug* Kopfhöhrere 3,5mm Klinke - für die, das noch wichtig ist.Mittel:* Nervige Bixby sachen, man kann sie nicht Mal alle deaktivieren.* Viele vorinstallierte schrott Apps, die meisten kann man einfach deinstallieren, das betrifft aber fast alle Smartphones, also kein Abzug.Negativ:* Fingerabdrücksensor - Finger wird vielleicht 25% erkannt, trotz mehrmallige Registrierung und Training.Meine Frau arbeitet in eine Industrieküche und had trockene Hände. Vielleicht für Leute, die ihre Hände nicht so ausgetrocknet sind, funktioniert es zuverlässige. Ihr altes Huawei hat, mit Sensor auf der Rückseite, hat nie gemeckert. Diese erste Generation-Technologie ist, mmn., nicht ausgereift genug.Sie ist auf Gesichtserkennung umgestiegen und das scheint besser zu funktionieren.Update 09.03.2020: Hmm, Fingerabrück ist jetzt bei 100% nicht lesbar! Sie hat es für Bank und Passwortmanager hinterlegt, aber die beiden Apps sind nicht mehr benutzbar. Ich musste die Fingerabdrück-Scan für alle Anwendungen entfernen und sie über PIN aktivieren lassen, weil, egal wie oft getraint wird, funkioniert der Scanner überhaupt nicht! Es war schlimm genug am Anfang, aber mit Händewaschen wegen COVID-19 sind ihre Finger noch trockene und der Scanner erkennt sie überhaupt nicht. Zum Vergleich, ihr altes Huawei mit normalem Scanner auf der Rückseite funktioniert noch einwandfrei.', 'Auf der Suche nach einem Nachfolgegerät für mein in die Jahre gekommenes Samsung Galaxy S7 bin ich auf das neue Galaxy S10 gestoßen.Positiv:- tolle Kamera (besonders die Telekamera mit 2fach Zoom bietet einen enormen Mehrwert, auch die Klangqualität bei Videos ist top)- Verarbeitung sehr wertig- Kopfhöreranschluss (bietet heutzutage ja leider nicht mehr jedes Gerät)- tolle Bild und Klangqualität (Stereo)Neutral:- Bixby (Button) - Es mag ja viele Käufer geben, denen ein Sprachassistent wichtig ist. Ich gehöre nicht dazu. Umso ärgerlicher ist es, dass es eine Bixby Taste gibt, die nicht deaktiviert werden kann. Es ist zwar möglich die Taste in den Einstellungen anzupassen, nur benötigt man hierzu einen Samsung-Account mit dem man stets verbunden sein muss. Hier hätte ich mir eine elegantere Lösung gewünscht.Negativ:- Akku: Leider ist der Akku viel schneller leer als bei meinem in die Jahre gekommenes Galaxy S7- Netzwerkprobleme: Es kam vereinzelt vor, dass die Netzwerkverbindung (Wlan oder Mobiles Internet) ohne Grund abgebrochen wurde- Abgerundetes Display: Andauernd führt es zu unbeabsichtigten Aktionen, wenn man das Gerät in der Hand hält. Hier sind mir randlose Geräte deutlich lieber.Da ich mich auf lange Sicht nicht mit den negativen Punkten arrangieren kann, werde ich das Gerät zurücksenden und auf das S11 warten. Dies ist eigentlich sehr schade, da die Kernfunktionen des S10 überzeugend sind. Auch hatte ich mit dem S10E geliebäugelt, welches kein abgerundetes Display hat.Dieses bietet im Vergleich zum S10 jedoch keine Tele-Kamera mit optischem Zoom. Ein S10E mit Tele-Kamera und besserem Akku wäre daher ein Traum. Wenn dann auch noch der Bixby-Button benutzerfreundlicher deaktiverbar sein sollte, hätte Samsung einen zufriedenen Käufer :)', 'Seit ich Android auf dem Handy verwende, besitze ich Samsung Galaxy S Telefone.S3, S4, S6edge und zuletzt ein S7edge.Gerade mein S7 hatte mich mit seiner perfekten Durchtdachtheit, frustfreier Bedienung, zuverlässig- und Robustheit über viele Jahre begeistert.Das S10 ist nun das schönste Handy die ich bisher gesehen habe. (in meinen Augen, ist immer Geschmackssache)Und auch mit Abstand das teuerste das ich je besessen habe. Meine Ansprüche orientierten sich aber trotzdem ""nur"" an meinem S7.Pros aus meiner Sicht:- ein wunderschönes Gerät mit angenehmer Haptik- Displaygröße im Verhälnis zur Gerätegröße toll- Displayqualität ist ziemlich beeindruckend- Performance- 3,5mm Klinkenanschluss- SD-Karten-SlotNeutral für mich:- Bin kein Foto-Spezialist, aber dafür dass das S10 3 statt einer Kamera hat, sind die Fotos jetzt nicht 3-Mal so gut wie beim S7. Aber das S10 macht schöne Fotos, keine Frage. Für meine Zwecke auf jeden Fall ausreichend- Die Akkulaufzeit ist in etwa auf dem Niveau von meinem 3 Jahre alten S7.Ich verwende allerdings beim S10 auch eher höhere Displayhelligkeit und volle Auflösung, denn dafür habe ich die 800 ausgegeben. Der Strom reicht also gerade so für einen Tag. :-/- Lautstärkewippe: War bei meinem S7 zwei getrenne Tasten die blind einfach leichter zu ertasten sind als eine Wippe, und eine Wippe fühlt sich im Vergleich beim drücken haptisch wertiger wertig an, finde ich.Contra:- Position Power Button:Welcher Ergonomie-Experte bei Samsung hat das nur durch gewunken?Ja, die Position ist dort damit man beim sperren des Telefons, nicht versehentlich zusätzlich die Bixby-Taste drücken kann.Warum hat man den Power-Button nicht dort belassen wo er bei meinem S7 war, und die Bixby-Taste dort hin versetzt wo sie hin gehört? In den Design-Papierkorb...- Bixby Taste:Danke Samsung, daß ich es nach 2 Jahren der Kundenbeschwerden geschafft habt die Taste alternativ zu belegbar zu machen. Warum nur kann man die einzig sinnvollen Belegungen nicht vornehmen? -> Aus dem Stand-by Licht an/aus, oder Kamera.Oder warum habt ihr das Ding nicht einfach weggelassen?? ihr spart euch Geld für einen Mikroschalter, Flexkabel, Kunststofftaste und ich spare mir Nerven. Niemand braucht oder will es.- Flow:??? Was bitte stimmte mit Sidesync nicht, Samsung??? Was bitte kann Flow besser?Nichts! Es ist nur wesentlich umständlicher zu bedienen, und der Datentransfer funktioniert nicht immer sofort.Und wieso bitte darf ich nicht wenigstens optional Sidesync weiterverwenden?Fazit bzw. TL/DR:Samsung baut ein perfektes Handy und verschandelt es mit völlig überflüssigen dummen Designfehlern.Für den Preis sind diese auch nicht verzeihbar.Ich werde es trotzdem behalten, da vergleichbare Geräte entweder größer sind, oder kein induktives Laden bieten.Samsung, 4,4 setzen, gerade noch so durchgekommen dieses Jahr.Nächstes Jahr weniger dumme Sachen machen bitte, ansonsten ist spätestens da Feierabend bei uns beiden.----Update:Habe es zurück geschickt.Für den preis sorgt es einfach fü zu viel frust.', 'Wie immer hat Samsung ein sehr gutes Handy auf den Markt geworfen. Das S10 ist handlich, man kann es mit einer Hand bedienen und es sieht gut aus. Natürlich ist das Display und die Kamera besser und das Gerät schneller wie der Vorgänger. Man fragt sich nur wie geht es weiter? Wird man zukünftig alle 6 bis 12 Monate 1000 Euro und mehr in die Hand nehmen müssen?Ich für meinen Teil nicht! Wir haben ein S9+ u. ein Mate 20 Pro die sind nicht so weit hinter dem S10 das sich ein wechsle für uns lohnt.Achja.....WPS gibt es nicht beim S10. Es wird Argumentiert das es unter Android 9 (Pie) kein WPS gibt ??? Also beim Mate 20pro und S9+ (android9) gibt es WPS !', 'Samsung eben . Schnelle Lieferung,  gut verpackt.  Alle Siegel unversehrt.  Sehr zufrieden', 'Das angeblich neue Handy, das über fulfillment geliefert wurde, entpuppte sich als gebrauchtes Handy, welches aus mindestens zwei Teilen zusammengesetzt worden war. Gott sei dank ging das Teil innerhalb von drei Monaten kaputt und Samsung hat mich darüber aufgeklärt, dass ich Gebrauchtware erhalten habe. Etliche Mails, diverser Schriftverkehr und Telefonate später habe ich noch kein Geld erhalten. Wurde mir aber zugesagt. Bin mal gespannt, wann das überwiesen wird.', 'Awesome phone.', 'Dieses Handy ist technisch sehr hoch entwickelt. Das Display lässt sich ohne Probleme auch bei hellen Sonnenschein problemlos ablesen. Der Fingerabdrucksensor arbeitet zuverlässig mit Ultraschall und der Prozessor ist richtig flott. Ein weiteres Highlight des S10 ist seine rückseitige Triple- Kamera (Weitwinkel 12 MP, Ultra-Weitwinkel 16 MP u. Tele 12 MP). Frontkamera 10 MP. Keine Verzerrungen bei Selfies, helle Innenaufnahmen, weitere Features : ideale Aufnahmeposition, Nachtmodus. Micro SD-Karten Slot usw. Aus der Modellreihe S10+, S10, S10e empfehle ich das S10. Es hat alles was der normale Handynutzer braucht.']"

You may not be that lucky.Overall very satisfied. Most android/ Samsung phones and tables get so software bloated after a few years and then the battery starts to loose charge fastest and you just give up and buy another. This one is holding up just fine."", ""Preface: I only ever owned iPhones up until I bought this phone, so my review will be based on how well the phone is and how user friendly the operating system is compared to iOS.Pros:Lightweight, slim, good camera, phenomenal battery life, screen protector installedCons:Slow fingerprint reader, can't access certain settings in lockscreen, finding a decent caseThe phone is slim and lightweight that I barely feel it in my hand. For some it might be a con but for me that's a pro. Further a decent case can give it a nice weight.The camera is nicer than I expected but to be fair I'm not one to obsess about phone cameras.The battery life last quite a while especially if you go to the settings and change the battery power settings to optimized or medium power saving mode. Typically for me it last up to 8 hours while I either play music, text and browse the internet. At work with music only it lasts far longer.Last, a screen protector comes preinstalled. It's a nice touch and it means I didn't have to buy one. However, the screen protector is on the flimsy-er side. It gets easily scratched. After a week with nothing in my pocket but my phone, the screen protector got small scratches. Cannot really complain since it was free but still just letting people know.Moving on to the cons, the fingerprint reader is slower than expected. I have tried putting my fingerprints multiple times but it does not compare well to iPhones. Mind you, the difference is about a second or so but my old iPhone SE could read my fingerprints faster.Some cases for this phone are flimsy and won't provide the protection needed so it's best to find a youtube video. I found a video, about 30 minutes long, with the person doing a quick review of like 30 cases, around a minute or so per case. He showed the case, placed it on the phone, dropped the phone with he case on it to see if it would protect the phone, and checked to see if wireless charging would work.Further, the reviews on some of the cases are so bizarre as some don't even seem to belong to the item the person is talking about. Also, there were multiple times that I searched for Samsung Galaxy S10 phone case, clicked on a case I found intriguing, just for it to be only for an S10+ or S10e. And I know to check under the product for the tab that allows you to change the style and sometimes even for what phone you want. Many of the ones I picked did not have this optionNow onto the operating system.  Some settings I was used to having on IOS are not found on android. For instance, the music player on the lock screen is not well placed or has a way to skip certain parts of a song. Also, if I want to quick respond  to a text, I have to unlock the phone and respond from the app. If I want to turn on or turn off the wifi or data, again I have to unlock the phone even if I use the pull down menu in the lock screen.On the other hand, android has made changes that have made the operating system user friendly for someone changing from iOS. For instance, you can choose to hide apps the way android traditionally handled apps or you can have them across multiple pages on the homescreen reminiscent of iOS.Overall though, by downloading some apps and changing certain settings, I was able to easily adapt to the phone.

You're paying for some gimmicky features to be sure (power-sharing and the wide-angle lens to name a couple), but the overall build-quality, improved camera software, and streamlined Android Pie skin alone make the S10 worth the price.To be clear, I love this phone. But here are some of the downsides, for those of you who (like me) look for the worst-case scenario in order to determine whether or not they could live with those flaws:(1) The fingerprint reader. I'm not really sure what was so dysfunctional or invasive about the rear-facing capacitive finger-print scanner, but the in-screen sensor just doesn't work 100% of the time. I've gotten better at finding the correct spot with my finger over the last month, but I would say that I still miss about 1/5 times...which can be annoying. Thankfully, the face unlock is pretty smooth for those of you who are comfortable with a less secure form of screen-unlocking. That said, if you want to use the fingerprint unlock even a little bit, you really can't have a *reasonably priced* tempered glass screen protector on your phone, which sucks.(2) The punch out is...not ideal. Having used an iPhone X for a while, I can say definitively that it's better than the notch. But with the improved durability of the mechanically retracting front-facing camera units, and the admittedly problematic emergence of under-screen cameras, it just seems like the hole-punch is a bit of a gap-filler for people who are desperate for more screen real-estate. I can't say that I forget about the hole-punch completely, but it also isn't obtrusive or offensive to me at this point. It's just part of the experience.(3) Bixby. Even though you can now re-map the Bixby button, no matter what you do there will always be a certain kind of press (double-press, single-press, or press and hold) that brings up some form of Bixby. It's kind of like when you're walking past sidewalk canvassers that are raising money for a cause that you definitely believe in: You can appreciate that the intent was pure, and you may even like what they have to offer. But you want to give them your time on your own terms, and when the pushier they get, the less interested you become...I may be getting lost in my metaphor, but you get what I'm trying to say.And that's it. Those are literally the only problems I've had. The cameras are great, the live focus mode is better than (in some cases) even iPhone X portrait mode, the response time and processing power are top-notch, and the screen is just unbelievable. Hope this helps you in your quest to find a new mechanical device to which you will inevitably devote half of your day, reveal all of your personal information, and possibly sell your soul."", ""I have been a long time HTC user and needed to replace a 2.5 year old phone so this is my first Samsung.  I like Android and wanted a phone that offers a decent screen size and a removable memory card option.  My previous phone had 64GB of storage, so this 128GB was a welcome upgrade and I didn't need to spend any more money for the 512GB version.  I do have a 256GB memory card for photos and video if needed, so I'd say I'm covered.  The 8GB of RAM should be more than I need for my phone needs, and I'm glad it has it, so far everything runs really smooth.  I'm also a long time Sprint user and so the concept of 'unlocked' was rather foreign to me since usually I'd have to go to a Sprint store and purchase a phone from them.  This however worked very well.  My only problem was I needed to get a new SIM card from Sprint, so after the phone arrived, I had to wait some additional time before I could actually use it.  Not that big of a deal and I probably should have checked into that before hand.Once I got the phone up and running on my Sprint account, with in a few days, Samsung updated the Android version from 9 to 10 with no issues whatsoever.The phone runs great.  Lots of Samsung software to explore and of course my old Android apps transferred over without any issues.  The camera is great and so is the video.  I really like the live focus for both photos and the video camera.  The screen is amazing and great edge to edge even with the case I have on it.  The finger print sensor is touchy and a fair amount of the time I have to use a pin to unlock it, I might switch to Face recognition instead.  The earbuds that come with it don't quite fit my ears very well, so I'm already on another pair of those.  I really haven't explored the Samsung Bixby feature that much, don't feel I need it, but its there if I want to try it.  Probably won't use the Samsung Pay at all.  I really like the feel the phone has in my hand with the case I got for it.Overall, I really like this phone.  Fits good, great battery life, gorgeous screen and when I got it around Christmas time, the deal I found was to good to pass up.  Of course they just announced the S20, but I couldn't wait and this phone will work just great for me."", 'The Samsung 10e is an amazing device, with capabilities that once only laptop computers had.  I purchased the 256gb version, and added an SD card to increase storgage to 384gb.  Overkill ? .... maybe; but I was tied of have my storage capacity eaten up everytime one of my programs had an ""update"": which seemed to be daily.I tried the Fingerprint Reader option for two weeks.  Unfortunately, 9 out of 10 times I was forced to type in the digital pass code after five unsuccessful attempts to unlock the screen.  It became a pain in the butt, and time consumming.  I want to state... I don\'t have a lot of patience when I\'m in a hurry; so maybe sitting around a cafe, the time it takes to use it is no big deal.I\'ve only ever used a Samsung smart phone, starting with the G4, so I cannot tell you how it compares to an iphone, as people tend to stay with things that are familiar to them... like brands of cars or other technical devices.  The selling feature to me was: I was familiar with the general operation, it was the same size as my previous model.... which I became accustomed to using... and has a huge storage capacity, even on the standard 128gb model..and the speed in which it connects to the internet or retrieves for internal storage, is VERY fast. And Charging is so easy... just set it on the charging disc .... and it even tells you how much longer it will take to charge to 100%.A word of CAUTION: ... with regards to a case..... you need to choose your case carefully though. I believe most people tend to put their phone in a case for protection (I do) or for fashion.  In order not to damage the phone or the chargeryou need to 100% sure there is absolutley no metal in the case, or the disc charger will not work, and might damage either the phone or charger.  I ordered what I thought were plastic cases (one with my baseball teams logo and one with my footballs teams logo) on line...  was sure they were 100% plastic because they were dirt cheap. Turns out there is a thin layer of foil under the silk screened logo to make the ink stick.  So I could not use the disc charger.  My husband\'s Samsung 10e has an even thicker case than mine, and his works perfectly.The Samsung 10E has more features....... that I\'m still exploring !', ""I have been using this phone for a month after upgrading from a Asus Zenfone 3 and I love it. Also has a headphone jack, so thumbs up to Samsung.I do just about everything on this phone and it handles it no problem. The 8GB of RAM is more than enough to run multiple apps all at once. I usually have my music player, Google Maps with sat view, Youtube, Amazon Prime video, a game and multiple browser tabs on Chrome and the performance doesn't dip at all.The battery life lasts me all day long, and sometimes two days with moderate usage (no games or videos) on an 80% charge. The fast charge saves me a lot of time, being able to go from 10% to 80% in about an hour or so but you may have different results because all batteries are different.The screen is beautiful, colors are amazing, sharpness is crisp and the responsiveness is snappy. There isn't much else to say there. Camera is just as great but that is to be expected from a $900 flagship.Speaker were surprisingly loud and clear without any hint of distortion, AND comes out of the top and bottom speakers. However, the default sound quality for music is flat and I would advise that you turn on Dolby Atmos immediately and tweak the equalizer._________________________A few complaints that I have echo other people in that the fingerprint sensor leaves a lot of be desired. Sometimes it reads my finger instantly, sometimes I have to play with it a bit, sometimes it fails to read it altogether and I have to enter in the code. Placement of the sensor is located at the bottom of the screen which is not ideal in my opinion. I'd much rather have it on the back.The Bixby button is also occasionally a pain in the ass. I keep my phone in my pocket a lot and if I accidentally press the button while trying to adjust the volume, I have to pull it out of my pocket to exit out of Bixby because it would stop my music from playing. A great feature that they added made it so that you can remap the Bixby button to open with a long press or double press but I just remapped it to open my music player instead so that my music will keep playing."", 'I am a budget conscious phone buyer and waited several months for a good phone deal. Got the S10 for $550. It is worth the price. I was seriously considering OnePlus 7T and pixel 3a XL. But went with S10 as the deal was good and I was changing phones from Galaxy Note 8.Pros:1. very smooth and responsive2. migrated data from my note 8 without issues. It copied all the apps/data/media.3. fantastic camera. I am now delaying my DSLR buy even further.4. Great sound. Louder than Note 8.5. Light weight. Much lighter than Note 8.6. Decent battery life (I dont use always on display)7. Edges are better than note 8. When I first started using note 8, I really found the curved edge to be useless. The S10 curve is not so bad and does not bother me any more.8. Big enough screen for reading9. Face unlock works better than finger print unlock. You pick up the phone and hold against your face and the phone unlocks without the need for pressing any buttons.10. Charges quick. I use my Macbook charger.11. Android auto kicks in quick.12. The punch hole camera is not a hindranceCons:1. No LED notification indicator like in Note 8.2. On screen finger print unlock fails 1 in 3 times3. The left most cards panel is not easy to customize. I have not figured it out.I have not tried bixby yet. For $550 I am very very happy.7/10/2020 Update1. The phone screen is a scratch magnet. I  dont use scratch guards. But my old moto z did not pick up scratches.2. Lately, when I want to end a call and lower the phone away from my face, the screen doesnt wake up. So annoying.7/16/20201.  Apparently the S10  comes with a preinstalled screen protector. I am hoping that the scratches are not on the actual glass.', ""Every few years a device comes out and history sees it as one of the best phones to enter the market place.  The 3 main reason I purchased the s10e and did not wait for the s20 range.  FFirstly the fingerprint reader is in the power button enabling you to unlock the s10e with one hand.  It's the best reader by a country mile.  Secondly when I buy a phone that is what I am after and not a tablet.  The s10e is smaller than the s7 and sits very comfortably in the palm of your hand and your thumb will touch the power key so register your thumb print.Thirdly the 3.5 mil audio socket is present on the s10e and while the audio socket is old it still works well, allowing a wide range of options when interfacing the device with other audio equipment.  Battery life just fantastic I had the s5 followed by the s7 and the battery gave me about one day of use on each of these devices and no I never use power saving modes after all I purchased a flagship top of the range device and I am not going to hobble it to get extra battery life by reducing processor speed and so on.  The s10e still has 68 percent of charge left and I use it from 9 am till 3 am next day.  I expected about the same as I got from the s7 but am greatly surprised.  I purchased the version meant for the US market due to the extra onboard storage and the qualcom snapdragon processor.When I dismiss a wake up alarm on the s10e it works all other devices the alarm keeps sounding every 5 minutes.In wrapping up there is not a thing I wish samsung had done differently, for my money the s10e US market version is just perfect.  The Aus version only had 128 gigs of onboard storage with the US version having 256 gigs but both versions support a 1 tb sd card.. I did have to purchase a suitable charger but expected this would be the case.  Not one thing re the s10e""]"

I have a full suite of Apple 8, XR , X, etc. and some other LG iPhones at work, but my personal phones have been Samsung Galaxy S for the last six years. It takes me a while to get comfortable with a phone, so I\'ve been on a three year cycle, S4, S7 edge, S10+.S4 was sort of ""meh"", competent phone, but a yawner. It was the infamous ""memory rip off"" phone: 32gig but so full of Samsung and T-Mobile bloat that it had about 7gig free on a brand new phone.S7 edge had a better memory setup, and was faster than whatever ""target"" machine Google was developing Android on, so it felt as snappy as it could be. It was truly gorgeous, compared to the S4 and compared to Apple\'s latest. And it had awesome glass. Samsung used this oleophobic (oil repelling) coating that just begged to be caressed. Frictionless. And the coating held up to 3 years of being shoved into my pocket constantly, no screen protector, no case (the metal edge and the glass back did fine, too. The thing was magic, rubbing around in a clean pocket kept the phone clean. I\'d pull it out, and coworkers would pull out some Apple product which would look like it should be quarantined because of the thick, nasty layers of fingerprints.This was my first unlocked phone. The Amazon Day deal was too good to pass up, and I was thinking ""yay, it might have Samsung bloat, but it won\'t have T-Mo bloat"".  The unboxing experience was anticlimactic. S4 had an amazing box, little hand-built wood thing. S7 had a nice box. S10 was, well, like Apple. The phone tried to escape during unboxing, again like Apple.The screen didn\'t feel good. It had that Apple stickiness. It picked up fingerprints. Samsung! What have you done? The way the screen joined the frame felt uncomfortable. None of the reviews mentioned this.I hadn\'t even turned it on yet, and I was contemplating returning it. But I put it on charge and settled down to read the docs. (and quickly learned that there are all sorts of USB-C cables in the world, and it didn\'t like mine for charging, but it did like that stupid 3ft Samsung charging cable, so got it charging)Came across something in the ""getting started"" that said ""this phone comes with a factory installed screen protector"". Thought to myself ""ah ha!"" and with a song in my heart set off to pry that sucker off. It was surprisingly hard, but I got it. Found a chunk of sticker-backing to stick it to, and put it aside.The glass was back! Frictionless. Begging to be caressed. Literally the best glass feel in the entire industry (I\'ve felt up the LG, Sony, etc. phones in the phone store before). Faith in Samsung restored. 128 gig, tons of free space, and I dropped in a fast 512 gig uSD card. Transferred all my stuff from the S7.Battery life? No midday charging needed unless I\'m doing dev work on it. It only needs charging at night. Since it was still 75-80%, I decided to see what it could do, and shoved a USB battery pack in my pocket in case it ran out of power. It did, somewhere in the middle of day 3. 2-1/2 days on a charge, when the S7 didn\'t really go past 1 with confidence.Data transfer to windows is broken. Tried different USB-C cables, different ports, even a different computer, and almost always get an error when transferring large files. But I can plug a USB-C flash drive into the phone, copy stuff on or off, pop it into the PC, and done.I tried DeX, and it impressed me.Had tried DeX on an S8 or S9 in the work fleet, and it seemed interesting, so I ordered a DeX Pad, to see if DeX was really worthwhile. Surprisingly, it is. Came right up on a spare monitor with a very usable desktop. Can use a bluetooth or USB keyboard, bluetooth or USB mouse, or the phone can be your touch pad (with that freaking awesome Samsung glass). It ran a 4T WD passport just fine.It\'s not for me, with all my math, CAD, and programming, but for the muggles who basically only need a good web browser, competent office suite, messaging, email, Spotify, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon (videos, music, and shopping), eBay, and some gaming, etc. a phone and DeX honestly can be an adequate computer replacement. One expects monitors and keyboards to last a lot longer than the 2-3 year phone cycle, so they\'re a good investment.Hey Google, make a DeX version of Android Studio, that would be a shot across both Apple\'s and Microsoft\'s bows.', ""I love the way the phone looks, its colour and functionality, the phone came with its own screen protector from the seller which fits it nicely, it was affordable and worth every penny in my opinion, and all its features works  well generally.However, I am not entirely impressed with its battery life, it could be better, I would suggest closing as much background apps as possible to help retain battery, and also switching on battery life saver, but doing so has its downsides in terms of limiting the phone's performance. Also be prepared for a lot of phone updates upon arrival, when I just got it I had to update it about 8 times to reach its current software version."", 'OK esla primera ves que compro un telefono en Amazon . Y al parecer todo va muy bien hoy es mi primer dia de uso y todo muy bien. Mi GalaxyS10+ es genial y llego en tiempo estimado. Esteticamente todo perfecto espero k tambien funcione asi de perfecto como ce ve. ♥️', 'I previously have S9 for work and iPhone XS Max for personal, here are my thoughts:The Good:- Speakers... wow... I am speechless- OneUI is wow, Samsung finally got the UI right, very user friendly and fluid- Feels very comfortable to hold, much better than S9 and iPhone- Screen is gorgeous, but a little too bright at night- Bixby Routine eliminated my need for Tasker- Headphone jack, although I didn\'t use it once, but it is nice to know it is there- Samsung Health is very very useful- All hail 8GB of RAM, all of my apps opened within the hour are still there!- Battery life is good (not excellent, pretty on-par with iPhone XS Max)The meh:- Power button is a bit too high, need to adjust grip when turning off screen- Back camera is good, but pretty much feels the same as S9 and iPhone (disclaimer: I am a dummy photo taker, pretty much point-and-shoot)- Samsung still nags too much on ""Here is what you can do on..."" and ""High volume can damage your hearing...""- Micro stutter during animation, rare, but still noticeable during app switch- Fingerprint unlock to home is slow, and it is much lower than I expected, but once I got the position, it unlocks 9/10 times (move your fingers around during scanning, it helps a lot), and I didn\'t even remove the original screen protector- Microphone is sub-par... especially during call, other side can hear their own echo, not the same experience on S9 or iPhoneThe wtf were they thinking:- Proximity sensor, it is waking up in my pocket ALL THE DAMN TIME (turned off double tap to wake helps, turning off life to wake and AOD solved the issue, but I need to features)- Still very convoluted to pick pictures from Google Photo if I need to send pictures or upload pictures from other apps- Samsung Smart Switch is still a very miss, transferring to S9 to S10 Plus made the phone very buggy, have to start fresh and redo every thing- Samsung Keyboard... sigh... back to Gboard- Front camera... I want to see my face without looking like a 12 year-old damn it- Curved screen, I felt like it is even worse than the S9 (maybe it is the size), a case helped with accidental touches, but my god it is still happening- OneUI is awesome, but the way they treat folders... If I created a folder in the app drawer and put apps there, then put that same folder to home screen, why are they not synced? Why I must add the same app to folder twice? (I don\'t want to use another launcher, I used Nova Launcher for 6 years and just want to use the built-in launcher for the sake of simplicity)- On the few occasions that I cannot use the fingerprint scanner (enough to be a nuisance), I really miss the iris scanner... this was the #1 reason why I did not pick iPhone to be the work phone before- Samsung Cloud... still cannot see SD Card... just give up already Samsung...- Motion Photo is still not compatible with Google Photo (this has more to do with Google than Samsung, but Samsung uses their own format to save Motion Photo, so I am blaming both)- Power Optimization still sucks (again, Android\'s problem, not Samsung\'s fault)So in summary, I feel like each functionality of the phone works very well, but the unify experience is still somewhat lacking', 'Note: this review is very similar to the one I posted for the S10e. I picked the S10e, and my wife picked a S10+ as she prefers the bigger screen. Since our experience is similar for both phones, I felt that it would be valuable to repost here for readers considering the S10+.While we were big fans of Windows Phone/Mobile, Microsoft’s decision to abandon the cell phone business pushed us towards Android.After some research we decided that the Samsung Galaxy S10 family would be a good fit due to the good relationship between Samsung and Microsoft and ordered unlocked models from Amazon while they were on sale.The phones are nice, but I still think that Windows was a better Operating System.What we like:1. The phones are very fast (No “Resuming…” message as on Window phones) and the screens are beautiful.2. There is a lot of apps in the store.3. The phones support MirrorLink so we can use our car’s built-in display to navigate using the paid app “Sygic Car Connected Navigation” (Microsoft was a member of the consortium behind MirrorLink but never finished implementing support in Windows Phone/Mobile).3. Most Samsung apps support Microsoft account natively so one can continue to use Microsoft services seamlessly. For example, one can access Microsoft contacts in the Samsung Contacts app without the need to import the Microsoft contacts into Google.What we dislike:1. The volume up and down buttons are opposite of the power button instead of above it like on all Nokia or Microsoft phones. This makes it hard to turn the phone on or off without pressing the volume buttons by mistake.2. The cable that comes with the charger is quite short compared to what came with Nokia and Microsoft phones.3. Most Samsung apps duplicate Google apps and that ends up cluttering things. A pure Android experience like what one can find on Google Pixel or HMD Nokia might be more appealing.4. The phones are not (yet?) compatible with Fitbit MobileTrack, so one cannot use the phone as a Fitbit step counter like it was possible for all Nokia and Microsoft phones (even though there is a Samsung app that can count steps using the phone).5. WhatsApp for Windows Phone/Mobile backs up messages on OneDrive, and WhatsApp for Android backs them up on Google Drive, so switching from Windows Phone/Mobile to Android means losing all the WhatsApp history. This is not specific to this phone but a disappointment nonetheless.6. The unlocked version of those phones (the one we ordered) are not fully supported by AT&T. Visual Voicemail works but VoLTE / HD Voice (calling over LTE for best sound quality) and Wi-Fi Calling (calling over a Wi-Fi when there is no signal) do not work. There are rumors that AT&T might enable those features on the unlocked version at one point but it remains to be seen if this will indeed happen.So to summarize, if you are a Windows Phone/Mobile user on AT&T looking for an Android phone, both the S10e and the S10+ are a decent option but if you must have VoLTE / HD Voice and Wi-Fi Calling you might want to pay more and order directly from AT&T or order a Google Pixel as allegedly all the Google Pixel phones (even the unlocked ones) are fully supported by AT&T.And if you are nostalgic about the Nokia brand you might also want to look at HMD Nokia models which probably do not offer VoLTE / HD Voice and Wi-Fi Calling on AT&T but have a clean Android system like the Google Pixel.UPDATE 29-May-2021After this phone received Android 11, I am pleased to report that VoLTE / HD Voice and Wi-Fi Calling are now both working on AT&T.', ""Update:  After 6 months of hard use, my initial review below remains true. My S10+ still runs just as quickly & without errors, as when new. & By using its pre-installed screen protector & a slim soft clear case, despite more than 15 accidental drops from standing height, my phone still looks brand new.Bought my Samsung Galaxy S10+ 128GB (US version-single SIM, Snapdragon processor) on Prime Days 7/2019, sold by Samsung, fulfilled by Amazon. Got the best deal on an unlocked version I could find at the time w/o a plan. First let me say the only downside was that my phone was shipped by UPS, & arrived in a horribly smashed, ripped box, which caused me to fear my new phone, now sold out til September, was also smashed. Thank goodness tho, somehow the inner box was undamaged. It arrived in a sealed original Samsung S10+ box, with AKG wired ear buds, a fast wall charger, a USB-C cord, an adapter for Smart-Switch, & it already had a TPU screen protector flawlessly in place on its screen. All I had to do was take my micro-SIM card & micro SD card from my old & very well used Galaxy S5 Active, pop them in this phone, turn it on, charge it, let it download my Apps & updates while charging, & I was good to go. Using my existing Cricket acct, there was no complicated activation, or lengthy start-up process necessary. & I have to say, this is a seriously gorgeous (prism blue), perfectly sized, super fast phone! It amazes me how much larger, brighter, & clearer the screen is, & how much more sound comes from its dual speakers with Dolby Atoms. Yet it doesn't feel any larger, or heavier in my hand, or pocket, than my 2 previous phones, slim case & all. I haven't experienced any glitches, it continues to run all my Apps so quickly, the finger print scanner works great, it hasn't gotten too hot while fast charging (w/included fast wall charger, or Yootech wireless Qi charger stand), & I haven't had any issue with it turning on in my pocket like my previous Galaxy S5 did. Battery life is amazingly better, even with my heavy use, including Netflix & gaming. The S10+ has so many ways to upgrade & customize your phone, it's wonderful. And since there's no Provider bloatware pre-loaded on the unlocked version, the only things you may want to disable are some of Samsung's Apps if you don't plan to use them (i.e. Bixby, altho I've found it can be pretty useful). So, if you're a tech junkie like me, who loves beautiful well made gadgets, & need a phone that can do what you ask, & do it very quickly, I highly recommend the unlocked US version of the Galaxy S10+, it'll blow you away!"", 'the US factory one (i was shipped the SM-G975U1 [white 128GB model] from the Black Friday sale with free galaxy buds) uses the Snapdragon cpu. As of 12/18/2019, it is not bootloader unlockable, or rootable.  The International model with the Exynos processor IS rootable/bootloader unlockable. But, those models wont work on the Sprint network. I have no idea if they\'ll work on Verizon/T-Mobile/Etc.Otherwise, the phone is a huge upgrade from my LG V20, but i dont know how much of it is just advancing technology, and how much is planned obsolescence. I havent had a good experience with the fingerprint reader, but i suspect its because of my gawd-awful screen protector (""L K"" [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PX2VYTZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1]). I used a Spigen phone case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MJQYDYB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1), and while it looks alright, and has a nice texture, I never felt safe with it on. I switched to the Unicorn Beetle Pro (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MZRLQ1N/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), after watching a case review from Flossy Carter on youtube, and i feel so much better now. it comes with a belt clip, but i dont use that part.the phone has some Bixby thing, but i dont use it, and i need to figure out how to re-map that button (right under the volume controls, so you\'ll press it by accident more often than you\'d like) to something else. maybe camera, maybe full  mute button. Ive used it in the car with android auto, but its closed itself more times that i would be comfortable driving with. so instead, i just use the bluetooth and listen to youtube videos as im driving. the battery lasts a while. good for when you\'re taking a while on the toilet and you found another reddit thread you want to read. because i came to this phone from the the lg v20, i keep expecting the fingerprint reader to be on the back, so i get annoyed when i hold it a certain way and the phone doesnt unlock already. but, who knows how long itll take me to adjust to the on-screen reader. i just know having a screen protector is a good choice because i want that layer of protection between my dirty hands and my clean phone. btw, the phone already has a screen protector on it, and its much better than the one i linked before. should have kept the original one on, until i found a suitable replacement.good phone so far.', 'great phone, my favorite of all time.  i love that i can add whatever i want without having to worry about space.  the 1TB of storage ensures that i never have to rely on internet to listen to my music, watch downloaded movies or shows, etc.if you happen to order one from this specific seller, however, be advised that they sent me a phone advertised as unlocked and free for all carriers, but when i installed the sim card i got a network lock message.  their customer service was friendly and diligent about following up which i appreciate but he fed me a bunch of stuff that didn\'t add up about the phone being unlocked but i had to get a ""blank sim card"" from verizon to download their firmware which would supposedly unlock the phone and allow my actual sim card to work.  verizon didn\'t know what i was talking about when i brought that up, needless to say, and they advised me to enter the IMEI number into a major carrier\'s website under their ""bring your own phone"" policy on their website to see if i could get the unlock code that way.  that did end up working, i had to get an unlock code from at&t.  it all worked out in the end and i will be using this phone, but it\'s pretty obvious that this company is buying second hand phones from trade in stock and then selling them as unlocked.  free from the initial contract does not mean unlocked.  unlocked means unlocked.  either do the leg work to actually unlock these phones, gentlemen, or change your advert headline.for those interested, you will get a great, as new, working phone.  you may just have to jump thru one or two more hoops to get it there.', ""My first thought when using the S10+ for the first time was WOW what a beautiful display!  But that experience didn't necessarily last for the rest of what the Galaxy S10+ had to offer and when all was said and done, I ended up returning it.  But first, here's what's good:1. Bold and beautiful display!2. Extremely loud speakers.3. Multiple day battery lifeFor the price, I was expecting to have my socks knocked off.  And my first impressions were extremely positive, but over the course of a few weeks, the phone started to wear on me, then frustrate me, then make me angry.  I'm not sure if my unit was defective or if it's just the way the new Galaxies are, but a few things just annoyed me to no end:1. The reception sucked.  I was coming from a Galaxy S8 and was expecting better reception everywhere.  The phone's bigger right?  It should have bigger antennas.  My signal was worse in almost every location I used the phone at.  When I was on a trip to Texas, I couldn't get more than a flakey 1 to 2 bars of signal no matter where I was (outside or inside).  DFW was almost a dead zone.  While my S8 didn't always have the best signal, it was at least usable in these locations.2. The fingerprint reader was just not flagship quality.  I don't really understand the huge rush to use in-screen detectors, but the number of failed logins was crazy (and yes, I registered my finger multiple times).  At least the face detection login worked well, but the fingerprint always seemed to mess up right when I needed to log in quickly.3. Samsung's updates.  My S8 was unlocked and Samsung's promise of monthly updates never seemed to be true, and it looks like it continues with the S10 series.4. Bloat.  I don't want Facebook on my phone, but I can't uninstall it.  Always multiple apps that do the same thing for no reason (two email apps, two browsers, two photo apps, etc.).  Samsung has their version and Google has theirs.  Even two app stores.  Really make no sense...and I can't remove many of them.  Just annoying, especially when some of the apps from my S8 from Samsung were better than the ones included with the S10 (Samsung, why did you make the clock app have less functionality?).I could have lived with everything, but the cell reception...the one thing a phone truly needs.  No calls + No data = paperweight.  At the end of the day, I couldn't take it and returned it (Amazon, thanks for being so great about returns).  Instead, I tried a Nokia 9 Pureview….and I love it.  Signal everywhere, bloat free, timely updates, and nearly half the price.  Of course, the Galaxy S10+ I had may have been defective, but even worse...it may not have been.  The Galaxy is a good device, just overpriced and overdesigned IMHO."", 'Love Samsung products']"

Dabei habe ich in den letzten Jahren aber immer öfter neidisch auf die Android Smartphones meiner Freunde geschaut, weil da schon seit längerem das Display / Oberflächen Verhältnis einfach viel ansprechender ist (z.B. Galaxy S8 vs. Iphone 8). Das iPhone X war dann das erste iPhone, welches an das futuristische Design der Andoird Smartphone Hersteller herankam. Und das zu einem unverschämten Preis. Als dann das iPhone XR kam, war ich sehr begeistert. Endlich ein iPhone mit einem riesen Display und einem kleinen Formfaktor und das zu einem relativ vernünftigen Preis. Dann kam die Ernüchterung, das Display vom iPhone XR ist mit seiner geringen Auflösung und seiner veralteten LCD Technologie Frechheit, vor allem in der Preisklasse.Damit hatte Apple mich entgültig vergrauelt.Als dann die neue Galaxy S10 Reihe auf den Markt kam, war ich von dem Design total begeistert.  Mir gefallen allerdings die abgerundeten Displayränder nicht so sehr, aber dafür hat Samsung mit dem S10e eine Antwort parat.Ich habe also sehr viele Testvideos geschaut und die waren durchweg positiv.Also habe ich das 10e bestellt, um es mir genauer anzusehen. Der Wechsel von iOS auf Android bereitete mir Gedanken. Aber selbst dafür hat Samsung eine Lösung:  dem S10e liegt ein USB Adapter bei. Dieser ermöglicht es alle Daten von dem iPhone auf das S10e zu übertragen. Und das ging denkbar einfach. Meine Fotos, Kontakte, Kalendereinträge und sogar meine gestellten Wecker wurden einfach übertragen. Außerdem werden automatisch alle App Äquivalente aus dem Play Store heruntergeladen.Ich habe mich sehr schnell an die Samsung One UI gewöhnt und auch die Android Einstellungen darunter wirken aufgeräumt und übersichtlich.Das Handy ist flott, der Akku hält genauso lange wie bei meinem iPhone 8 und das Display ist klasse.Das Punchhole ist gewöhnungsbedürftig, aber es nimmt weniger Platz ein als eine Notch.Insgesamt bin ich sehr zufrieden mit dem S10e. Und ich muss nicht mehr neidisch auf die Displays meiner Freunde schauen ;-).', 'Nach zwei Monaten ging das Display des Gerätes kaputt. Leider habe ich erst im Anschluss das Alter des Gerätes über die IMEI Nummer geprüft. Dabei kam heraus, dass das Handy bereits aus 2019 stammt und damit 4 Jahre alt ist und als NEU verkauft wurde.Unglaublich.', 'Ich habe das S10e am Prime Day für 479€ gekauft.Als alter Google Pixel Benutzer (Pixel 1,  2 und 3) wollte ich einfach mal was anderes sehen - und ich war wahrlich kein Samsung-Fan. Ich wusste von Anfang an dass vermutlich die Kamera mit den detailreichen Aufnahmen der Google Pixels nicht mithalten kann - andererseits war ich schon lange genervt mit den limitierten Möglichkeiten des Pixels .. und vor allem der schwachen Helligkeit des Displays (Pixel 2 XL).Für mich war vor allem wichtig: Weitwinkel-Kamera, kleiner Formfaktor, helles Display und 3,5mm Klinkenanschluss.Überhaupt für den guten Preis zum Prime Day glaube ich die richtige Wahl getroffen zu haben. Das S10e bietet eine Top-Performance, ein schönes Display und ein handliches Design. Die Kameras wissen durchaus zu überzeugen, für mich sind die Aufnahmen und die Bildverarbeitung eine gelungene Alternative nach jahrelanger Google Pixel - Kost.Schön langsam gewöhne ich mich auch an die vielen Einstellungsmöglichkeiten und die Software-Anpassungen von Samsung, die mir immer mehr gefallen.Pro:- kleiner, handlicher Formfaktor- Weitwinkel-Kamera- sehr helles Display- schneller FingerabdruckleserContra:- ""nur"" Full HD Auflösung- im Dark Mode kommt es bei manche Apps zu Darstellungsfehler(bei mir zB Amazon Music .. Hintergrund schwarz / Text schwarz)- Bixby - nutze ich persönlich nicht - hab den Hyperion Launcher mit Google Feed installiert. Ist sehr zu empfehlen.', 'It looked like new! Great phone! No problems with it at all!', 'Der Fingerabdruckleser ist mit dem Einschaltknopf an der rechten Seite verknüpft. Er ist sehr umständlich einzurichten und funktioniert auch bei weitem nicht immer.Es wäre viel besser, wenn der Fingerabdruckleser mit dem Home-Button verknüpft wäre, so wie das bei vielen anderen Handys der Fall ist.', 'I like the size of the phone. On the smaller side which is perfect for me', 'Endlich wieder ein handliches Handy, die Kleineren sagen mir in der Handhabung einfach mehr zu.Gesichtserkennung und Fingerabdruckleser funktionieren  wirklich klasse. Auch mit dem Touchscreen klappt es ausgezeichnet.Insgesamt bin ich mit diesem Handy S10e sehr glücklich, habe es jetzt seit ca 5 Wochen testen können. Würde es wieder kaufen.Es passt super gut in die Hosentasche, das A80 von Samsung war mir einfach zu groß und alle Möglichkeiten zum Verstauen des Handys waren für mich einfach nur unzureichend bis nervig.Der Kontakt mit der Verkäuferin war sehr freundlich und unkompliziert. Der Versand wurde schnell abgewickelt.Insgesamt 5 Sterne in jedem Bereich!', 'Alles, wie versprochen.']"

I am not tech-savvy and do not use all the features, at least to advantage.  For example I have no use for the PTT and find the button to be in the way sometimes.  But the sturdiness of the phone is impressive and many of its features seem to work fine.That said, it is not perfect.  We live in something of a dead zone and I cannot make or receive calls at our home and to a large extent in the immediate vicinity.  (Texts work fine here.)  This would not be the only phone with this problem, but I have had others which can penetrate the dead zone.  Also the XP5s seems to find other dead zones and can have problems with reception elsewhere.  That lack of sensitivity has been disappointing.It does not have a touch screen, and that is not a problem for me.  I dislike smartphones because I find myself always pushing some button unintentionally.  I find the settings menu fairly easy to navigate and somewhat intuitive.  On the other hand, the buttons are on the small side and I would not want to try to make calls or particularly send texts with gloves, despite advertisement to the contrary.One other issue is using a headset.  (I have one I like from a previous phone.)  It has taken some experimentation in order to use the Klein 3.5mm adapter successfully.  The contacts on the Klein and the phone apparently struggle to make an adequate connection, and I have found that they need to be wiped before each use.  Otherwise the volume may be affected, there may be excess static or crackling in the connection, and calls may be dropped.But when the adapter connection is clean, or just during a non-headset call, the call usually is quite clear.  If using the speakerphone feature the sound is loud and clear.  It may be clearer than some previous phones, particularly smartphones, and volume from the speakers is great.I have been in touch with Sonim technicians by chat or directly, and it must be said that they have been uniformly helpful and responsive.  The phone has a good back-up in that way, especially appreciated by those of us who lack some of the technical competence that is so useful today.I have not tried dunking the phone or dropping it, but it offers the appearance of a very sturdy instrument that would not be liable to many of the hazards of other phones.  At this point battery life seems to be quite good.  For example I last charged it four days ago and the battery life is at 78%.  I don't use a cell phone extensively and I am guessing I will get at least two weeks from a charge normally.Overall, the XP5s more than meets my needs at present.  It is not perfect but on the other hand probably will outlast some previously inadequate phones."", 'A basic phone, but works great! T9 texting works great. The phone never crashes and the battery lasts a long time!', ""Have to keep resetting the setting I put in,  constantly goes back to defaults settings;  it's really frustrating  1⭐ for that.  It's so frustrating, I'm ready to send it back.  But, for that, there's a few minor hiccups I can deal with.  Will update this review if the seller would contact me, as to what is causing the phone to continually reset back to defaults; ASAP, the window to send back is close!"", ""Very rugged phone. Really loud speakers. Quadruple as heavy as other phones. Can't zoom in on any picture. It runs Android 7.1 but third party=Non Sonim apps won't install.

It works great with At&t in New York.  Much better reception than my iPhone 7 was getting.  But when I went to the t-mobile store yesterday to switch they said the phone would not use full bandwidth and some images might not appear.  Sounds like BS salesperson talk to me.  But they said the antenna in the phone wasn't big enough and they would not support it.  Could have just been a way to get me to buy one of their phones!!  Anyway, I ended up staying on At&t because the price at t-mobile wasn't that much better anyway.The phone is pretty quick.  Doesn't feel like a top end phone.  Definitely mid range, but certainly as fast as my iPhone 7.  I am very careful not load up useless apps that will run in the background.  It comes with a nice little LG app to detect memory and battery issues caused by apps and will even schedule a weekly reboot.  I did notice my battery running down fast on the second day.

Screen is good, the process to open and close phone is good. Face recognition is okay, but is always actively searching for your face and does not unlock unlock the screen, it just says the screen is unlocked now, and you have to physically swipe up to open the phone. So, it's annoying at points. But the lock screen changes photos every time you unlock it, which is pretty cool.Comes with some bloatwear but not a lot. Has room for you to configure the apps and lets you move the icons around.Connectivity is good! I can load pages on the go now! Except, like others have said, it does not run on 4G LTE via t-mobile. It does go 4G though which is good enough for me. Now I don't have to use the free slow wifi at work.Camera is nice! Except for when taking pictures for instagram via the app. The quality of the picture goes down and image shrinks for some reason.Which takes me to the notch. The notch isn't that annoying. It's what it is. It's there to tell us which side is up, I guess.Ringtones are cool, but I don't use them. So, the vibrate mode is good but loud! I like it though! I can hear it then.It does have a little notification light that lights up to tell you you have messages or something.Now the keyboard, the only thing that is annoying about it is that the space bar is toooooooooooooooo close to the home circle. When I go to hit space, my thumb hits the home button too because my hands are kind of stubby. So, they gotta work on that.The screen protector that came with it, sucks because I tried to put it on, and it created air bubbles that would not go away.Battery life can only be in the good range if the power saving mode is on! Like with out it, the battery drains like crazy. I don't know why but it just does. This phone is not for super heavy use. I just update my social media apps and 1% some how drops as I look at it for a few minutes. So, there might be apps running in the background I do not know about. Downloading stuff uses battery power too!Playing videos, full screen is full but not where the notch area is. So, it does not get in the way of watching videos on youtube. And in power saving mode, the display is kind of knocked down to help conserve energy. YAY! Let's be more eco friendly no?Unboxing, I was a little skeptical if it was new because the plastic on the screen was crooked but whatever, I'll probably change it in a year or two because of the newer cameras coming out.Well, that's about all I have, I'll update in about a week how things are going!!UPDATE: So It has been 3 days and the battery on power saving mode is still going strong! Also, the phone likes to fall a sleep sometimes and not wake up where the power button comes in handy. Also, face detection is always on while holding the phone but when placed down, it will not recognize your face. Also, if it starts falling a sleep, just rock it."", ""Just purchased this phone a few days ago and Huawei hit a home run with this phone. Coming from a Huawei Nexus 6P phone which I owned for 3 years, this phone blows it away. In my opinion, this phone with a glass back is as just good as any premium $1,000 android phone. The phone is very fast opening apps and with the 6.3 inch screen size, watching videos is like having a high def. TV.  The software (both android 8.1 and EMUI) has many features and operation is very smooth with no hesitation. Phone calls are loud and clear. No drop calls with T-Mobile. The battery life is unbelievable.  I just got three days and two nights with 12% left of battery life (light to moderate use including phone calls, Iheart radio, youtube, facebook and texting, but no games).  The camera with AI takes really good photos, especially selfies.  Video's are good too, but no 4K. For the $299.00 price (plus I got $70 credit with the Amazon Visa card with no fees) it was a fantastic deal. Like I said, the best phone for the best price.  Also, comes with a case and screen protector.  The only complaint is that I wish the placement of the fingerprint sensor was just a 1/4 inch lower because it is too close to the camera bumps. However, you won't be disappointed with this phone.  I will update my experience next month.Update One Month Later:After one month with this phone, I am loving it. It is the best phone I have ever owned (I loved my previous phone the Nexus 6P ,but had battery issues). First of all, the battery is amazing. No, I don't get three full days, but definitely 2 full days with moderate use and still 10% left. If you want up to three days you can use the regular battery saver setting  or you can use the ultra saver setting for maybe four days or longer. Again, unless you watch video's all day, you will  never have to carry a battery charger with you for daily use.  The processor is very fast and the phone never heats up during use. Wifi connection is excellent and I haven't dropped a call yet using T-Mobile. And, yes you do get 4G LTE service with T-Mobile and it is very fast. But, it doesn't have the new T-Mobile Band 71 or 700mhz. Like I said it still connects very well with T-Mobile in the USA. The AI makes amazing regular and selfie photos with this phone (easy just to point and shoot). It does have some bloatware with Huawei EMUI, but it does not affect the performance of the phone. Also, I would definitely purchase a screen protector and case for the phone due to the glass back is very slippery. Overall, it is a beautiful phone and I still give it 5 stars. As I stated before, you cannot purchase a better phone for the price. Excellent value."", 'September 2021 UPDATE:I doubt many people are looking to buy a phone that is almost 3 years old, but I thought I\'d update my experience with the Mate 20 Lite. After 2 years and 8 months of use the battery is finally starting to wear down. Up until a few weeks ago the battery had showed no signs of age, and there were still many times I only needed to charge my phone every two days. But with lithium batteries that\'s how they go, they seem perfect until suddenly they are getting ready to die. But if it wasn\'t for the impending death of my phone\'s battery I would be in no hurry to replace this phone. It still does everything I need it to do. Unlike my Samsung experiences, the Mate 20 Lite did not start to slow down or malfunction around the 2-year mark. Honestly, if I was still in Canada I\'d probably buy this exact same phone again now that they are blowing them out for $150! It got OTA updates until Android 10, so the OS is still pretty current as well.  I definitely got full value from this phone.Original review below….This is a very nice phone. Quality build, looks great. Reminds me of my wife\'s Galaxy 8, but at half the cost.My previous phone was a Galaxy 6 Edge and even though the 6 Edge screen resolution is higher, I think the Mate 20 Lite looks better. Obviously a bigger screen, but everything looks more vibrant.The phone is fast and responsive with no lagging. Face recognition works very well, and fingerprint unlock is lightening quick. Battery life is fantastic.Only complaint so far is that ""OK Google"" voice prompt doesn\'t work unless you press the home key first. I don\'t use Google assistant much so it\'s not a deal breaker, but I do prefer a completely hands free voice assistant. Hopefully there will be an update to android 9 (Pie) that will fix this issue.UPDATE:I\'m upping my rating to 5 stars.  Now that I have used this phone for a few weeks I can honestly say I love it. The battery is amazing. I used to charge my phone twice a day, now I charge it maybe every two days. No lags, no apps slow to open. I\'ve switched to the gboard keyboard, and replaced the stock music player with Google music and now my user experience is everything I want it to be. I don\'t even mind having to hold the home key for a moment to access Google voice assistant.', ""Battery Life: GreatValue for Money: GreatEven though it is a Lite version, you would not feel lacking. If you have a 1 or 2-year old phone (or even older), and if you think of replacing it with this one, I tell you, if you do, you won't regret it. This phone has a premium feel to it. The OS's performance is superb, super fast. The screen is beautiful - the images are clear and crisps. The selfie camera is probably not that good - but I don't really do selfies, so that doesn't really matter. The back camera, even though I have not taken much, can produce great videos.Fingerprint recognition - works very well.Facial recognition - I don't recommend using this. The camera finds the face in all angles it can cover. The phone can be easily accessed. (But Huawei does warn the users that it is less secure)NFC - Not in this version.Dual-sim - YesYou don't need a $1000 phone to have a great phone. This phone is already great. If you are a user who does not want all the extra features (that you hardly use anyway), go for this phone.For Canadian customers: This works in the Telus/Bell network."", ""I bought an Honor play to use as my primary phone. I instantly fell in love with it. The speed, the operating system, the look, the screen, the ai camera, the battery life. It was by far the biggest jump in upgrade for a phone i've had in 15 years. One drawback, no 4g in the us. It was my first international phone so i wasnt fully knoledgeable about the purchase. I returned it and got this Mate20 lite. Roughly the same price you get a lower spec'd processor, and no ai chip. The ai functions well on this lower speced processor, and i did have the phones side by side for a few days before i sent the play packing. side by side tests, the mate is slower on facial recognition, camera isnt as good (front camera is as good or better though), and it seems they have the exact same display. I ran a benchmark (3d mark) on both phones since there was no info on the kirin 710. I got a dismal 930 Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1. Slin Shot Extreme-Vulkan 1126. Signifigantly less than the honor play (around 2900 points ins slingshot extreme).At first i was worried, but after a few weeks of use i cant really tell a difference. i dont play games but for every day use the phone has been great."", ""I waited 3 months to write this review and all I can say is that I am extremely satisfied with the Mate 20 Lite. For starters the build quality is nice and feels premium, for a 6.3'' phone it fits nicely in a hand. Phone is fast and all the apps and features run smoothly with little to no lag, in addition, it is also very responsive. Camera quality is also great with the addition of the AI support photos are automatically sharpened and cleaned for the best quality possible. The facial camera works great most of the time, I say this because at times in low light it easy recognizes but in a room with the blinds fully opened (or a very bright room) it has trouble recognizing. Its not really a problem as there is also a finger print sensor that so far has been working as intended.One issue I have found is that some calls are automatically transferred to voicemail even though I have call forwarding disabled. I have T-mobile so it may be a frequency issue but it happens rarely, in addition, some messages get delayed as wells. I'm not too bothered by this but it can be an inconvenience at times such as work calls.All in all, I think this is a great phone both for the price and performance you are getting."", ""As the headline claims. It works with Freedom Mobile. Well sorta. It doesn't work with 4G all the time. Most of the time it's on H+ network which I believe is 3G. If you don't give a damn about internet speeds and a good bang for a buck, then this phone is top-notch(no pun intended :P) Voice works just as it works in freedom. But I haven't lost a connection so far. Freedom works great with B66, B4, B7. But mostly with band 66. Check out other band 66 devices list on reddit. And this phone supports B4 and B7. It's been less than 24 hours since I've got this phone. I live in the west end of Brampton which is sort of out of the 4G zone. I thought I took one for the team as this phone just came out, well in September but no one was buying it I guess, but it worked out great so far. That's all, folks! Please let me know if you have any questions."", ""This is my second Huawei phone I bought. So for all you first timer and a bit skeptical, I can understand your thoughts initially. But let me assure you this phone is excellent!!! I have used Samsung phones, iPhone and Huawei phones. I can tell you it works the same and at times surpasses the others. It doesnt get hot during recharging like the other two. Life of battery is EXCELLENT. Camera resolution, on par as those of the other two cell phone brand. I really cannot find any drawback in this phone. You may need a little time to get adjusted to the operating software, but it is still Android based and it should take no time to get adjusted. And to be quite honest, in terms of internet usage, Huawei surpasses the other two brand. Its more reliable and faster. The best part is, the price is unbeatable!!! In today's age where cell phones are becoming standard commodity, there is no need to spend  USD 1K for a cell phone. This Huawei will do the job just fine. Plus more for a few hundred bucks!!! CANT BEAT THIS DEAL!!!"", 'Me gusto el modelo y la verdad me gustaría volver a comprarlo', ""Recently bought this model about a month ago. Could not be pleased with all the features and offerings. Simply mindblowing. Before this I has a Samsung S3 and it was starting to slow down considerably due to age.  This Huawei 20 mate lite is a night and day difference. Love the display, very nice and HD. This is a great phone at a great price. I've read some questions about how to turn off the vibration sound on notifications, you need to go to each notification and disable it.  Expand the notification banner and underneath it will show settings and you can choose vibration or sound notifications.  The photos of the actual phone do not do it justice. Its a solid performer.  Very satisfied with my purchase.""]"

This gave me confidence to take the plunge and swap from my OnePlus 6 for the top of the range Honor 10.The handset is slightly smaller but much lighter in the hand than my OnePlus 6 and therefore has a more comfortable weight about it. The overall feel of the phone is fingerprint magnet, the Honor Play is metal, lovely and very classy. The Honor 10 is glass front and back and while lovely to look at needs to be slipped into the clear case before the look is ruined.What made me pickup the Honor 10 was the camera experience of the Honor Play, all the pictures looked great because the phone uses an AI calculation to work out what you're trying to take a picture of and does some techno wizardry. This works on pretty much every picture when in the AI setting is enabled (default camera setting), is worth noting that these pictures come out with detail, effects and colours tweaked.  Attached are two pictures taken out of the window, one from a OnePlus 6 has more natural muted colours and the other the Honor 10 seems to have bright contrasts. Because of this I believe the Honor 10 camera is for the Instagram and social crowd because of these enhancements.I can't stress how much I enjoy the size of the device, it makes swiping, texting and general typing far easier and quicker. I'm not overly keen on the SwiftKey keyboard, but I've installed the native Google keyboard which seems fair more predictable and better spacing.Battery life seems to be similar to the OnePlus 6 and other flag ship phones and certainly gets through a day of use, the Honor Play lasts far longer though, but I think the trade off is good, a lighter handset and smaller battery is a win win.The display is bright, vivid even (this can be changed in the settings) and it's worth doing. The colours in vivid are just too unnatural and with the AI mode active means pictures are harder to guage colour wise. The screen does have a notch, it's not large like the iPhone X, XS or XR and is far more subtle in its implementation giving you far more space at the top of the screen. As icons are smaller you get far more in the notch space compared to the OnePlus 6 which is extremely handy for tracking.I have noticed that sometimes the screen doesn't feel as responsive, it's hard to explain but it feels like I'm having to do more frequent tapping. I never noticed this problem on the Honor Play, which is suppose to be near identical but with different camera and display sizes.One other big difference between the Honor Play and the Honor 10 is that the Honor Play supports Glove mode it changes the screen by working on pressure input so you can leave your hands safely covered in the cold weather... This is completely missing on the Honor 10 which is disappointing especially as the Honor 10 is suppose to be the flagship for the Honor brand.Some other things to note, the phone has facial unlock, fingerprint and 6 digit PIN for unlocking, facial unlock seems to work well in most lighting conditions, the fingerprint reader is also extremely fast and seems to work well even with wet hands.Getting use to the Honor is simple for those switching from an Apple devices, EMU uses a very similar structure which can be changed in the settings to a more native Android feeling but it still doesn't feel right. Going the native route does seem to have a performance benefit. It does take some adjustment if you're new to the Huawei or Honor brands. They also have an easy layout for a more simplified interface which is actually impressive for more elderly users it's disappointing that this is hidden in the settings but really helps without those who need it.Right, now onto the issues...I don't think this is phone related but more the EMU interface which Huawei/Honor install... Lots of software is preinstalled, some can be deleted, but most is not even worth using, it's disappointing as it feels like the software is a mixed bag; Microsoft Translate... When you can just install Google translate. It continues with music, calendar, mail, clock etc...Overall it's an impressive device, is it as good as the OnePlus 6 maybe but it's the current price, design and image quality which is something to challenge other competitive devices. This is what is remarkable.Overall the negatives can be lived with and I don't think they detract from the overall package of the phone."", 'Now had this phone for coming up to 3 years. Still would not replace it. Original write up: I\'m quite discerning when it comes to phones and for that reason have never been an iPhone fan, as I consider them overpriced and poor on value for that overprice. I have in the past favoured HTC handsets in particular. About a year ago a bought a Huawei 10"" tablet which was great value and a lovely device giving many features as well as speed and performance. On the strength of that and in spite of Trump\'s unjustifiable mindless actions against Huawei and China, I bought this Huawei / Honor 10 as the features and price made it an attractive proposition. I have only had it a few days but can tell you this is indeed a beautiful and fabulous device stuffed full with features, excellent screen resolution, good sound and an amazing AI camera that offers excellent results even in poor light. Colour definition and depth are what I would expect from a phone costing twice as much and more. Even unadvertised features such as Mirrorcast are included so I can (at no cost) project what is on my phone screen directly onto my TV (which supports \'cast\'. If not you can get a dongle from Amazon for about £20 which using this feature turns your TV into a smart TV!) - Yes it does! Huge storage of 128gb is enough for my stuff with over 1,200 pictures and 700 music vids, etc and still not used 1/3rd ! The Honor 10 comes with Huawei App store as well as Google Playstore which is a bonus. Facial and Fingerprint recognition are both on board and work well. The phone size is just right - not too big or small. The processing speed is very fast and games are colour rich, sharp and don\'t lag. Do check this out and read all the specs as I promise you will not be disappointed. I am a firm believer in Chinese quality, having a number of elec items including a great electric shaver too. Easiest 5 stars ever. No, I\'m not getting paid for this(!) it\'s just that Huawei deserve the credit for offering such a great phone at such a reasonable price. A month later - love this phone.', 'I had an Honor 7 for two years and upgraded to this Honor 10. Here are my thoughts.PROSNo SD card. Loads of internal storage (120GB) so no need to keep moving apps between memory and storage to free up space.The screen is great and very crisp and there\'s more space for icons.Porting between phones is a doddle even when you have dozens of apps.The new version of Android supports split screen which was top of my wishlist!NFC is really useful and easy to set up to pay for things with.The phone is narrow enough to easily hold in one hand, which was a big requirement for me.CONSThe fingerprint reader is rubbish. I often have to press it several times which is really annoying if I want to use my phone quickly. It worked perfectly on the Honor 7, so they\'ve gone backwards.Photos in even moderately dark light come out terrible with the default settings. I have to mess around and take a ""night"" photo if I want to be able to see anything!The battery life is not brilliant. I am a heavy user and I still need to charge it twice a day sometimes.OVERALLA big improvement on the Honor 7 but keeps a similar look and feel, just a bit more modern. Upgrading was relatively painless and everything still works. There are a few niggles, but it\'s still a good phone.', ""I researched a lot for a new phone. I'm only giving up my old Oneplus X due to its paltry 16 Gigs of storage, other than that it has been a brilliant phone. But I have no brand loyalty to anything these days, I go for the best in my budget.My first choice was to be the Moto G6+ but the reviews were inconsistent so I went for the Honor 10 which has had universally great reviews.I'm impressed.Its great looking, I mean really great looking.Screen clear and lively colours.Fast and fluid. Ive had no issues so far.Large 128 gig memory, which is great as no expandable storage.A bit of bloatware, but thats been removed.Ive been used to almost stock Android with my last few phones, so this Honor overlay is a bit annoying but there are some good additions too.Charges very quicklyBut also not the greatest battery life, but not terrible. Im hoping Honor might sort this with an update.The camera seems really good, lots and lots of settings and options. Haven't really tried too much yet.( I purchased on 1 June and I got the free headphones, i think people forgot to add them to their order to get them free, anyway they're really great headphones)Ive had the phone less than a week and I do like it a lot. I will give it a two more weeks and then come back and review this review."", ""Having had this phone for a couple months now, It's time for a review.Camera is OK, Not great, It oversharpens everything.The AI is a gimmick and doesn't really do much apart from oversaturate everything, It does however make night shots look better.As a power user, The battery life is decent, I bought a power bank anyway.Fast charging is very fast indeed, It's a nice addition to such a well priced phone.Screen is good, The aspect ratio is good for watching Netflix wide-screen 21:9 content but 16:9 YouTube content doesn't look out of place.The mobile network speeds are good, I'm not sure if that's my carrier or the phone but it's a fairly solid connection.As for gaming, I haven't done much (as a PC based gamer mostly) but I tested a couple for the propose of this review and I see no problems.For those that like to plug USB stuff into their phones, OTG works fine, SD card reader works, Charging other devices also.The back glass looks AMAZING, I love it, Really good job on that Huawei, It's way better than a case. (Oh yeah did I mention that one is included for free? Along with a screen protector (albeit a plastic one)Anyway I recommend it as  a tech enthusiast, It's well worth the money and IMO better than Oneplus for actually hitting that £350 price point that the 3 and 3T used to cover.(And it still has a headphone jack!)"", 'The phone was delivered on 16th November 2018, but did not start to use for about a week. I liked the phone when it first arrived. It charged fairly quickly. However after about 2 and half months, it stops whatever I am doing. IF I am phoning someone it just stops without any reason, the battery is fine, I have to phone back and apologise to the person and explain that it is my phone. It is happening so may times with different numbers that I know it is my phone. Also it dials the number by trying to see the number of the person who called me so I can send a message and it calls the person, or even if I just wish to delete the number and it dials the number. I cannot cancel the the dialled  number as the red button used to cancel the dialling disappears. It is virtually impossible to delete or cancel the phone call. The green button shows, so I feel it has not dialled, it is ok, but it has dialled and other person either responds or not there and then after a while it stops as I am not talking on the answering machine and it tells me number of minutes remaining. The problem also occurs when I am on youtube and it stops and gets me out of the youtube or whatever I am doing like writing a text or an email message.  This has been happening for well over 2 months and it is getting very frustrating now, especially when you are busy and wish to make few phones calls or messages urgently and mis-dialled number cannot be cancelled. Or when on the phone, it suddenly stops and you are conversing or waitng for a response. I had Samsung before twice and had no problem,even with one refurbished one. They lasted for well over 4 years each.One of them, I have it and can still use it, though it is just 32GB, hence purchasing phone with 128GB.  I shall be contacting the seller about this, now.', ""Love the phone, camera is amazing, crisp clean display, runs apps well and meets my expectations for most things.Only thing that is disappointing and is actually a really big bummer is the bluetooth. It is incredibly laggy and suffers from great interference. When I have it in my left pocket it is unlistenable due to the lag and interference. If I'm walking to work I have to hold my phone in my hand if I want to listen to the music, but even then it is still sometimes laggy. I have never had a device that has such a poor bluetooth connection. It's definitely not my headphones because with my last phone it was fine, and with other bluetooth devices such as a home speaker, it still lags and sometimes completely stops even when the devices are right next to each other.If the bluetooth worked as I wanted it to, I would rate this 5 out of 5 stars. I know the obvious solution is to just use wired headphones, but this is a smart phone review."", ""I think other reviewers have probably covered all the details, but I really enjoy this phone! It's a good size and is easy to hold in one hand, and it is SO PRETTY! The blue gradient really works well and I often just stop to admire it as it catches the light so beautifully. Performance wise I have no complaints, it runs everything I need to quickly and there's plenty of space on it so I forget that it doesn't have an SD slot as it's seamless. Nice to not have 'no space' alerts every few weeks! The battery life is average. I don't think it's much better than my previous phone (a Samsung) but it comfortably lasts the day at my level of usage and being a new phone, doesn't accelerate in usage at the end of the day. The AI feature on the camera is hit and miss I would say; when it works well it really makes the photos pop, but sometimes it gives lurid hues to skin tones that are really patchy and strange! It's really easy to retrospectively remove the AI feature though; no need to have taken the photo with it off initially as they are mostly (completely?) filters that apply over the image based on what it is. No complaints really! A good phone that hopefully will last me a few years at the same quality."", ""Not only delivery was unsuccessful on two occasions despite i was at home awaiting the phone desperately, it arrived short of headphones which i didn't notice  listed before as missing as it was refurbished model I couldn't even notice few schratches on the back however the phone was in its protective clear case and just after one drop from the high of bedside table on the  carpeted floor landing on cover protected back it has cracked all over. I wonder if they used only weak pretty glass case or  was the scratches that weakened the case. Anyway after few days i have realised that the phone has also video playback issue so after numerous searches online trying to fix it as thought to be software issue i gave up and have to return the phone.on the positive side its fast, pretty, battery lasts long and charges quickly, face recognition is good compared to other phones but fingerprint scanner somewhat doesnt like my big fingers and it s position I cant get used to much.  Huawei attempt to dominate apps like samsung copying Apple or Google is very annoying and duplicates apps and mainly games with load of adverts or asking for purchase. just a waste of space, effort and time on some apps.  They should releease also aclean version without the junk forced by manufacturer."", ""I've been very pleasantly surprised by this phone - I've always had the expensive flagship Samsung Galaxies and assumed that a great camera, battery life, features and premium glass build were only available on the priciest phones. This year however I snapped when I saw the price of Samsung's latest offerings - £800 and upwards, that's crazy! So after some research I heard about the Honor 10, which ticked all the boxes and added an IR blaster and huge storage capacity to boot so thought it was worth the try - so glad I did it's AMAZING! The blue version has a stunning multilayered glass back that changes from blue to purple to teal when tilting it, the front is taken up by it's awesome vibrant display and it's incredibly fast. The camera produces excellent pics, it's got a long battery life and other than not being watertight and only having one speaker it easily beats all the fancy flagships I've owned for less than half the price - considering that Honor still have to turn a profit, it makes me slightly horrified how much of the cost for the Galaxy phones I've owned was just for the name! Very highly recommended, however do please note that to receive the free wireless headphones offer YOU MUST ADD BOTH TO YOUR ORDER AT THE SAME TIME - I didn't and had to reorder the phone and headphones, then return my original phone which was a bit of a faff!""]"

Seitenaufbau im Browser geht schnell voran.galeriebilder werden sehr schnell angezeigt.-moto gestefunktionen sind sehr hilfreich-grosser Speicherplatz-der Fingerabdrucksensor vorne kann auch für andere Funktionen verwendet werden.-der Lautsprecher hört sich gut an und ist im Vergleich zum redmi Note 4 kraftvoller.Ich höre jetzt überwiegend Internetradio OHNE externe Lautsprecher.-ich hab zwar mit fotografieren noch nicht rum experimentiert,aber es scheint als würde die kamera überdurchschnittlich gute Bilder schießen.zumindest für mich im Vergleich zum redmi Note 4 um Welten besser.Ich möchte aber auch negative Aspekte ansprechen.-dual kamera hinten ragt deutlich über die Rückseite Oberfläche.Haben die Motorola Entwickler nicht daran gedacht,das mit der Zeit genau diese Stelle zerkratzt wird?Denn genauso diese Stelle wird jedes Mal die Oberfläche berühren,wenn man das Smartphone irgendwo ablegt. Selbst ein Laie erkennt das,dass das mit der Zeit nicht gut gehen kann.Auch die im Lieferumfang erhältliche Silikon-Schutzhülle schafft keine Abhilfe.Das war eigentlich ein k.o. Kriterium für mich,aber dann habe ich gedacht,probier erstmal eine alternatives Case von Drittanbieter.so habe ich eine von hier bei Amazon gekauft und siehe da,jetzt ist auch die Kameraabdeckung einigermaßen geschützt.-akkulaufzeit,das ewige Leidthema.wir sind im Jahr 2018 und Smartphones halten mit Mühe einen Tag durch.beim Moto g6 plus ist es auch nicht anders.oder bin ich zu sehr von den 4100mah des Xiaomi redmi Note 4 verwöhnt?-das 18:9 Displayfolie,Geschmackssache,aber mir wäre ein 4:3 Format lieber.Ich vergebe das Moto g6 plus nur 4 Sterne.5 Sterne hätte ich vergeben,wenn-längere Akkulaufzeit-altes Displayformat.-kamera hinten hätte,des Schutz wegens, auf gleiche Höhe mit der Rückseite liegen sollen,siehe Galaxy S7 etc.-Preis sollte nicht höher als 250€ sein.motorola selbst hat es mit dem Moto g1 gezeigt wie es geht.mittlerweile machen es jetzt andere als Xiaomi ihr vor.PS: jetzt auch was konkretes zu der kamera BIldqualität.Ich hab experimentell das gleiche Motiv mit dem Moto g6 plus und das alte aber hochgelobte Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge meiner Frau geknipst.Die Bilder stehen zur Anschuung und können direkt verglichen werden.bei beide Geräte ist der Automatikmodus ausgewählt worden.Bild 1 ist das Galaxy S7 Edge,Bild 2 das Moto g6 plus. Ich bin zwar kein Fotoexperte,aber eins kann ich erkennen.obwohl beide Geräte ein hochwertiges Bild erzielen,erkennt man beim Moto g6 plus Bild eine bessere Helligkeit im dunklen bereich.und generell wirken die Bilder des Moto viel realistischer als die amoledlastige Bilder des Galaxy S7 Edge.Ps: nach 2 Monate Nutzung fällt mir negativ auf,dass das Internetradio sporadisch unterbrochen wird.unter den gleichen Bedingungen hätte ich mit mein vorheriges Xiaomi redmi Note 4 keine Unterbrechungen.Weiterhin ist mir negativ aufgefallen,dass die Glasrückseite einige unschöne ""Pünktchen"" aufweist.keine Kratzer oder schramme.scheint von kleine partickelchen verursacht zu sein,die sich zwischen Schutzhülle und Glasrückseite einschleichen.hier kann man nichts machen.ich weiss nicht,ob diese Symptome mit andere vergleichbare Smartphones genauso auftreten,darum lasse ich die 4 Sterne Bewertung so wie sie ist.', 'Nachdem ich jahrelang nur Huawei und Honor Geräte hatteund diese auch wirklich immer zu meiner Zufriedenheit waren,habe ich nun zu Motorola gewechselt.Schuld daran ist das neue Honor 7X, welches mich sehr enttäuscht hat.Etwas anderes in diesem Format, 64 GB Speicher, dieser Preisklasse und 4 GB ROM musste her.Nach langem Suchen bin ich auf das G6 plus gestoßen.Als Warehousedeal - Zustand sehr gut (es ist praktisch NEU!) habe ich es dann gewagt.Und ich bin echt begeistert!Design:Wirklich schön nach hinten abgerundet, sehr edel aussehende Rückseite in schönem tiefen Blau (Indigo)Verarbeitung:Es knarzt nichts. Alle Spaltmaße sind gleich.Tasten und Buchsen sind gut bedienbar.Es ist Spritzwassergeschützt!Fingerprint:100% Treffer.Keinerlei Ausfälle, Millisekunden schnell!Display:Sehr schöne helle Farben, auch seitlich sehr gut einsehbar.Display reagiert sofort.Jede Menge Möglichkeiten, sich es seinen persönlichen Bedürfnissen einzustellen.Wie z.B. abends Augen schonen, Farbumkehr usw.Einschübe:Es können 2 SIM Karten und 1 Speicherkarte gleichzeitig eingesetzt werden.Bei den meisten ist es ja ein Hybridfach - hier nicht.Jede SIM kann einzeln auf Ihre Funktion eingestellt werden.Der Zugriff auf die SD Karte (ich habe eine 128 GB Samsung drin) erfolgt,ohne das ich eine Verzögerung merke.Speicher und Arbeitstempo:64 GB brutto (abzgl. des Betriebssystems) sind schon eine Hausnummer und sollten eigentlich jedem reichen.Der Prozessor und seine 4 GB ROM lassen die Anwendungen blitzschnellund ohne Probleme starten und ausführen.Akku:Der könnte besser sein.Er ist nicht schlecht, aber im Vergleich zu dem Mate 10 lite oder Honor 7X eben viel schlechter.Der Akku hält bei mir einen Tag, also von morgens bis abends...Gut ist aber, das man mit dem Ladegerät innerhalb von ein paar Minuten wieder ""Saft"" auftanken kann. Natürlich nicht voll, aber wenigstens etwas.Sound:Beim telefonieren ist alles glasklar.Auch beim Freisprechen.Mein Gegenüber versteht mich auch sehr gut.Beim Musik hören merke ich einen deutlichen Unterschiedzum 7X oder Mate 10. Und zwar positiv.Ein wirklich sehr klarer Musikklang, so gut es bei einem Smartphone geht.Konnektivität:Per NFC kann ich es zu Hause steuern.Ich habe im Eingangsbereich NFC Module, das ich beim verlassen des HausesWLAN ausschalte und wenn ich wieder reinkomme, wird es eingeschaltet.Funktioniert wunderbar.Bluetooth isst auch ohne Probleme.Es hat sich sofort mit meinem PKW verbunden.Gleichzeitig ist es noch mit meinem Honor Band 3 gekoppelt.Auch ein Headset zum Sport (Musik hören) wurde sofort erkannt.WLAN in beiden Frequenzen funktioniert tadellos.Auch LTE Empfang ist einwandfrei.Software:Android 8 ist vorinstalliert mit LinkedIn und Motorola Software.Leider kann man die Buttons usw. nicht anpassen bzw. ändern.Das fand ich bei Huawei und Honor immer sehr gut.Dort hatte man die Möglichkeit über die entsprechende Design App einigeszu ändern.Auch kann man dort 2x WhatsApp oder Facebook betreiben - für jede SIM extra.Dies fand ich sehr sinnvoll.Das wünschte ich mir hier auch. Dies umgehe ich aber mit WhatsApp Business ;-)Motorola Apps:Moto Sprache - man kann einige Aufgaben darüber starten und sich SMS usw. ankündigen lassen.es ist noch BETA - und ich finde auch, es ist noch nicht ausgereift.Moto Infos:Infos über die Einstellungen. Z.B. Nachtdisplay, Benachrichtigungen usw.Diese kann man hier übersichtlich sehen und bearbeiten. Nice to have - muss man aber nicht haben.Moto Key:Hiermit kann man per Fingerabdruck auf selbst festgelegte Websites zugreifen.Moto Action:Hier kann man diverse Einstellungen vornehmen: Taschenlampe einfach einschalten mit Fingertip, Screenshot mit 3 Fingern usw.Lieferumfang:Moto G6 Plus, Schnelladeadapter und USB C Stecker, Anleitung, TPU CaseFazit:Ein tolles Gerät, das hätte ich von Motorola nicht erwartet.Ich bin damit sehr zufrieden und empfehle es uneingeschränkt weiter.1 Stern ziehe ich ab wegen:Akku und fehlende Möglichkeit, ohne Fremdsoftwaredas G6 meinen Bedürfnissen optisch (Buttons z.B.) aufzupeppen,sowie die Möglichkeit, WhatsApp 2x zu nutzen.', 'Ich hatte das Moto G3 das Moto G4 das Moto G5s plus und nun das Moto G6 Plus.Der Quanten Sprung war nicht zu erwarten. Aber es ist genau das was ich mir gewünscht habe. Nach dem Note 4 von Samsung war ich 5,7 Zoll gewohnt und habe es bei Motorola nicht gefunden. Nun habe ich 5,9 Zoll finde es wunderbar. Insbesondere da das Handy nicht wirklich größer ist als das Moto G5s Plus aber trotzdem 0,4 Zoll mehr aufweist.Auch schön, endlich können neben der SD Karte zwei SIM-Karten (Nano) eingebaut werden.Der Akku ist ausreichend. Nach einem bisschen spielen am Vormittag, gerade mit der Kamera sind nach 7 Stunden 15% weg.. das passt zum Verbrauch vom altem Moto.Neutral sehe ich den USB-C Anschluß.. ok... ist jetzt Standard.. Aber wer nur Micro-USB Kabel daheim hat hat jetzt erst einmal nur noch 1 Ladekabel für Arbeit,Auto,Daheim,Urlaub :-) Aber wie gesagt.. ist nun einmal jetzt Standard aber ich hatte es nicht auf dem Plan.Negativ sehe ich derzeit, das es auch nachdem ich die Anleitung gelesen habe, für mich nicht möglich ist den SD-Karten speicher nach Intern zu bringen (Was ja früher immer möglich war).Es fragt mich gar nicht ob ich das will.. Ich kann ihn auswerfen,formatieren als Portablen speichern und ""Bereitstellen"" mehr nicht.Ich gebe trotzdem 5 Sterne da bei 64GB intern und die 128GB meiner SD Karte für Bilder/Video/MP3 wohl kaum ein Speicher Engpass entstehen wird.Nach der Einrichtung und Aufspielen meiner Apps (also alles vom alten Handy herholen) habe ich von den 64 GB nur 19,65 GB belegt und ich soll150 Apps installiert haben.So.. noch ein Wort zu den ""neuen"" Feature die rausgelobt werden von MotorolaDie Kamera. Sie war schon beim Moto 5Gs sehr gut (bei mit G4 wurde bei mir 3/4 der Bilder unscharf).Und die gewohnten Sachen nach wie vor vorhanden.Neu sind Funktionen wie Gesichtsfilter (Also z.B. Katzenohren auf dem Selfie) naja.. ich brauch das nicht.Oder Detailaufnahme da wird dann etwas aus dem Bild geschnitten und der Rest wird schwarz z.B. mein Top-Case vom Roller.Auch diese Funktion erscheint mir verzichtbar.Schön hingegen ist die Zeitraffer Video Funktion. 3,8,16,32 Fach wird aufgezeichnet. Die Zeit der Gesamtaufnahme und die länge des nun eigentlich Video wird angezeigt. Klasse gemacht.. Kann auch ich sicherlich mal brauchen.Auch schön ist nun die Funktion ""Gruppen-Selfie"".. ein sehr großer Raum hinter die wird damit abgedeckt. Bei meinem ersten Versuch noch etwas unscharf aber OK.. das bekomme ich sicherlich noch hin wie schnell man die Kamera drehen darf :-)Mir tut der Kauf der Kamera nicht leid und finde das Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis für sehr gut.Ich empfehle sie gerne weiter.', 'Motorola moto g6 Plus Smartphone (15,0 cm (5,9 Zoll), 64GB interner Speicher, 4GB RAM, Android) Deep Indigo\nMein altes Smartphone musste ersetzt werden. Nach einigen Recherchen auf das Moto gestossen. Bin kein Freund von umfangreichen Hersteller eigenen Benutzeroberflächen, daher war das Moto direkt meine Wahl. Ok, die Größe ist gewöhnungsbedürftig. Das geht aber sehr schnell, da es ja auch einige Einstellungen gibt, welche eine Bedienung mit dem Daumen bei gleichzeitigem Halten erlauben (z.B. Bildschirminhalt verkleinert sich nach wischen und lässt sich so mit dem Daumen erreichen).Habe dem guten Teil noch eine 64 GB Karte (bei mir: SanDisk Ultra 64GB) als externer Speicher spendiert (der Einsatz als interner Speicher wäre auch möglich, Muss aber direkt beim ersten Einlegen der Speicherkarte festgelegt werden). Kurz zusammengefasst:Pro:Klare und scharfe Darstellung auf dem DisplayVerarbeitungsqualität gutFlüssiges Arbeiten kein ProblemKein überflüssiger (abgesehen von manchen Google Apps) Schnick/Schnack installiertIn Verbindung mit Android 8 gute und zahlreiche EinstellmöglichkeitenKamera reicht für Alltagsbilder mehr als ausVoll Videostreaming tauglich (meistens über WLAN. Geht aber auch über 4G, das schluckt dann aber Datenvolumen).Filme, welche im HD Quali aufs Gerät geladen wurden, werden flüssig, ruckelfrei dargestellt.Neutral:Tonquali über den eingebauten LS geht in Ordnung. Man kann über die Einstellungen ein wenig mehr rausholen.Gerät ist kein Fliegengewicht, ist aber natürlich der Größe geschuldet.Akkulaufzeit geht in Ordnung. Normale Nutzung (Musik hören, App-Nutzung usw.) gut 1,5 Tage.An das Handling muss man sich aufgrund der Größe eine zeitlang gewöhnen. Geht aber.Contra:Kamera steht wirklich deutlich aus dem Gehäuse. Die Nutzung einer Hülle (eine liegt bei) ist zu empfehlen. Die beiliegende Hülle ist durchsichtig klar und geht auch erstmal. Qualitativ ist sie, meiner Meinung nach, aber nicht aber oberen Ende der Skala anzusiedeln, so dass hier Ersatz geschaffen werden muss.Keine Benachrichtigungs-LEDDer Fingerprintsensor nervt. Aber ich finde die nerven auch bei anderen Smartphones.Der USB-C Anschluss zieht natürlich die Anschaffung eines neuen Kabels (bei mir: K13 USB Type C Kabel) etwa zum Laden im Auto nach sich.Zusatzkosten (Beispielhaft):Vernünftige Hülle: ca. 12,00€USB - C Kabel: ca. 7,00 €Speicherkarte z.B. 64 GB: ca. 23,00€Fazit:Gutes Smartphone mit gutem Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis, dass alle gängigen Alltagsarbeiten souverän meistert. Habe die Anschaffung nicht bereut. Klare Empfehlung.Hoffe aber, dass es bald mehr Auswahl an Hüllen gibt.Zur Hülle kwmobile Hülle für Motorola Moto G6 Plus habe ich mir erlaubt eine Rezension zu schreiben, da ich sie erworben habe.', ""I have been an iPhone user for the last 6 years. However, I felt that Apple was demanding too much for a product that did not offer enough value for money. I began searching for a mid-range android device (300 to 500 euros). I did extensive research into a number of phones, e.g., Samsung A8 2018, Nokia 7+, LG G6, Moto G 6+ and the One Plus 6.After nearly 8 weeks with the device, I still feel I made the best choice. While the one plus is clearly a better phone, it also costs 40% more. It also does not offer enough to warrant the 200 euro increase in price (better camera and screen, but not that much better). LG G6 battery life is underwhelming after Oreo updates (from what I hear), the Nokia 7+ was a close contender, but the speakers are poor at higher volumes (still probably a great phone), and the Samsung (which is also probably a really good phone, did not shoot video in 4K). It was a tough choice, as they are all pretty good phones.As for the Moto G6 +, the screen is excellent (better than my old iPhone). It has excellent color production and is great for media consumption.  The battery life is good (usually gets me through a day to day and a 1/2). Good sound quality. The processor is quick enough that I am never frustrated by the performance.However, while the pictures are good (excellent in good lighting), they are not amazing when you zoom in (my sister's $1000 iPhone looks better when zoomed in, but also costs more than 3x as much  -  and how often do you zoom into photos). Additionally, the phone is a little tall (sticks out of the jean pocket just a bit) and has a pronounced camera bump (but it does not bother me as the phone does well on flat surfaces).I do wish it had waterproofing but will settle for the nano-coating. What a like most about the phone, it is a great value for money (you get a lot for a little). Really happy with the purchase."", 'Nachdem mein Samsung Galaxy S7 nach kurzer Zeit nach einem Mini-Stoß nachhaltig kaputt war und die Reparatur fast dem Neuwertpreis entsprach, entschied ich mich für das Moto G6 Plus für unter 200 Euro.Richtig gut finde ich, dass auf einen eigene Android-Oberfläche verzichtet wurde, wo Huawei und Samsung ihren eigenen Kram draufwerfen, den man mögen kann, aber nicht muss. Für mich fühlt sich das gut und richtig an, weshalb das G6 damit bei mir schonmal punktet.Das Display ist riesig, was unterwegs zum Videos gucken super ist. Die Farbbrillanz ist aber meiner Meinung nach schlechter als die des S7.Der Akku hält dafür länger als der des S7. Jedenfalls musste ich auch bei intensiver Nutzung noch nicht Zwischenladen (mal sehen, wie lange der Akku seine Kapazität halten kann).Etwas hinderlich war zuerst der USB-C-Anschluss, da die alten Ladekabel so natürlich nicht passen. Für unter 7 Euro habe ich aber ein 4er-Set Adapter gekauft, mit denen ich die Kabel weiter verwenden kann.Schade ist, dass das Gerät keine Stereolautsprecher hat wie früher mal mein Moto G (2nd Gen.), aber meistens habe ich eh mein Bluetooth-Headset gekoppelt. Das funktioniert einwandfrei mit dem G6.Insgesamt bin ich mit dem Gerät glücklich. Zur Sicherheit verwende ich immer die mitgelieferte Schutzhülle (prima Idee). Hätte das Galaxy S7 sowas dabei gehabt, wäre das Telefon wohl noch intakt und ich wäre nicht zu Motorola ""übergelaufen"". So aber bereue ich den Wechsel nicht und werde fürs erste Motorola-Phone-Nutzer bleiben.', 'Zu meiner Person:Bin ein Smartphone-Junkie, habe wohl schon so gut wie jedes Gerät getestet, habe keine Favoriten-Marke... hier nun mein Fazit zum Moto G6 Plus:- Haptik: sehr gut, wirkt wertig, liegt gut in der Hand und die Displayränder wurden nun auch verkleinert, super! Der Platz über- und unterhalb des Displays wird für den Fingerabdrucksensor und für den Lautsprecher benötigt.- Display: großes 5,9"" mit tollen Farben, nur schade, dass es kein Amoled-Display ist, aber es ist gestochen scharf (Schwarzwert nicht so toll, Weißwert überragend). Überrascht hat mich die Helligkeit, diese ist extrem hoch.- Kamera: hier war ich wirklich positiv überrascht. Die Qualität der Bilder ist wirklich klasse, auf High-End Niveau. Selbst der Bokeh-Effekt (Portraitmodus) macht richtig Spaß. Und vom Hocker gehauen hat mich die Stabilisierung bei Videoaufnahmen (getestet bei FullHD mit 60fps). Als zusätzliches Goodie bekommt man noch einen Selfie-Blitz mit dazu.- Lautsprecher: Ich höre sehr gern Musik, und zwar über den Handylautsprecher, und dieser hier ist klasse. Zum einen ist er relativ laut und klingt nicht blechern, zum anderen ist die Position (unter der Hörmuschel) klasse, da er so nie verdeckt wird.- Weitere Pluspunkte: USB-Type C nun auch in der Mittelklasse, zuverlässiger Fingerprint-Sensor, 3,5 Klinkenanschluss, klasse Moto-Features (Handgelenksdrehung: Kamera startet / Handgelenk schütteln: Taschenlampe startet, etc...), Always-on Display und eine klasse Akkulaufzeit. Dazu kommt noch ein fast reines Stock-Android.Die Hardware (Prozessor, Speicher, RAM) ist für die Mittelkasse ebenfalls toll mit 64 GB Speicher, 4 GB RAM und nem Mittelklasse-Snapdragon mit acht Kernen.Was mir etwas zu denken gab war die Tatsache, dass der Speicher nur mit 128 GB erweitert werden kann. Aber was soll ich sagen, hab seit ca. 2 Wochen ne 400er Karte im Gerät und es funktioniert problemlos.Ich bin hellauf begeistert von dem Gerät... und was man nicht vergessen darf: ES HANDELT SICH UM EIN SMARTPHONE UNTER EUR 300,-!!!Es ist vielleicht nicht das Allerschnellste auf dem Markt, aber es ruckelt nicht (wohl wegen dem Stock-Android) und ich hatte auch mit leistungsintensiven Games nie Probleme.KLARE KAUFEMPFEHLUNG... WAS WILL MAN MEHR FÜR DIESEN PREIS?FÜR MICH HIGH END FÜR WENIG GELD!', 'Das Motorola G6+ habe ich durch einen kleinen Artikel in einer Fachzeitschrift gefunden.Dort wurde Motorola (seit der Übernahme durch Lenovo) wieder als Geheimtipp gehandelt.Das hat mich neugierig gemacht und nach etwas Recherche und Vergleich der technischen Daten habe ich es dann einfach bestellt.Zuvor hatte ich immer ein iPhone und Samsung Galaxy im Einsatz. Diese waren in der Anschaffung wesentlich teurer. Durch die Nutzung eines Geschäfts und Privathandys musste ich aber immer zwei Geräte mit mir herumschleppen - sehr unpraktisch.Das Motorola mit der Doppel-SIM löst dieses Problem mit einem ""Schlag"".  So kann ich beide Nummern mit einem Gerät verwenden und könnte sogar bei Bedarf nach eine SIM ausschalten, falls ich mal auf dieser Nummer nicht erreichbar sein wollte. ;-)Das Display finde ich soweit gut, auch wenn es bei den Flagschiffen bessere Display gibt, aber zu einem ungleich höheren Preis. Es hat jedenfalls eine sehr schöne Größe für mich.Das selbe gilt für die Kamera - diese macht bei richtiger Anwendung ebenso schöne Fotos.Ein weiterer Grund für das Motorola war für mich das fast unberührte Android-System ohne Zusatzmenüs, Hersteller-Apps usw. das nicht mit irgendwelchen unnötigen Details überladen ist. Das finde ich super und ist bei den anderen namhaften Herstellern (Samsung, Huawei, etc.) nicht so zu finden. Ebenso werden Android-Updates dadurch schneller freigegeben als sonst und du bist dadurch immer auf dem neuesten Stand.Auch die nachfolgenden Serien machen einen guten Eindruck, obwohl ich sie noch nicht (ausser G7+) getestet habe.Jedenfalls ist es für mich ein super abgestimmtes Gerät mit einem tollen Preis / Leistungsverhältnis.', 'Ich habe lange nach einem Handy in der mittleren Preisklasse gesucht. In der Auswahl waren Huawei P 20 light und das Nokia 7 Plus, sowie das Moto G6 Plus. Das Moto hatte anfangs  für mich die meisten Features für den besten Preis:- wenige vorinstallierte Apps- flotter  Prozessor und mit 4 GB ausreichend RAM für alle Anwendungen.- liegt gut in der Hand durch das 18:9 Format und ist  nur ein Tick (circa 1 cm) länger als mein 5, 5 Zoll Samsung- gute Kamera mit viel Unterstützung bei der Einstellung (mit Vorschau der Einstellung z.B. Belichtung ändern)-  2,5 und 5 GHZ WLAN Netz-  solider Akku (hält einen Tag durch)- Anzeige der Nachrichten im Bildschirmschoner statt per LED. Aktiviert wird der Bildschirm durch drauf schauen. Er erkennt, wenn sich etwas über ihm bewegt.Jetzt kommt das aber:- Das GPS ist unterirdisch schlecht. Ich hatte zwei MotoG6 Modelle getestet und keines konnte  Satelliten finden, noch ein GPS- Signal fixieren. Das GPS lief nie (auch nicht nach einem Wechsel der GPS Antenne). Navigieren kann man daher nur per WLAN und Netz, wobei ich jetzt im Nachhinein sagen muss, dass der Netzempfang nicht so gut war.Der Service von Motorola war dazu wirklich unterirdsch.  Amazon schaffte hier sehr flott und unkompliziert Abhilfe. Ich habe mich für ein anderes Handy entschieden, das Nokia 7 Plus. Dort läuft alles.', 'Für\'s Geld prinzipiell kein schlechtes Smartphone (Hardwareausstattungsmäßig gesehen). Es läuft alles flüssig, Akkulaufzeit kommt selbst bei intensiveren Nutzung auf locker 2 Tage und mit ner Dual-Kamera, sowie 2 Nano-Simtrays + Micro-SD Schacht, Prozessorpower und ordentlich RAM ist jegliches wünschenswerte allesamt mit an Board, insgesamt überwiegen doch einige Mankos (Usability / Design), die mir persönlich missfallen.Als erstes gibt\'s es direkt Mal Bloatware. Outlook und LinkedIn sind direkt mit an Bord und können lediglich deaktiviert werden. Leider sind die Apps nach jedem System-Update wieder im App-Drawer...Das größte Problem besteht aber im Design/Handling. Auf den ersten Blick ganz schick das Teil, auch die Glasrückseite macht prinzipiell was her, aber: anfällig für Fingerabdrücke ohne Ende. Mitgeliefert wird eine Silikon Schutzhülle und die ist auch bitter nötig. Ohne wird einem das glatte Telefon wahrscheinlich schnell Mal aus der Hand gleiten, aufgrund der Displaygröße kann man es schließlich bei der Bedienung nicht immer fest umgriffen halten. Weiterhin ist der Rahmen des Gerätes das kratzanfälligste und empfindlicheste was mir je unter gekommen ist. Ich habe das Gerät nun erst 12 Tage und ausnahmslos nur mit der Schutzhülle verwendet; trotzdem habe ich an den oberen und unteren Kanten nun bereits über die komplette Länge Kratzer uns stumpfe Macken! Wtf. Und ich habe es bisher wirklich wie mit ""Samthandschuhen"" behandelt.Was mich ebenfalls stört ist die Position des Mikros für Telefongespräche. Dieses ist unten links im Displayglas untergebracht. Für die Sprachverständlichkeit sicherlich förderlich, optisch aber absolut scheußlich. Andere bekommen es ja auch besser/anders gelöst! Wo wir gerade bei Telefongesprächen sind: der Lautsprecher für normalen Töne ist ebenfalls in der Hörmuschel untergebracht. Ich bin einmal versehentlich beim annehmen auf die ""freisprech"" Schaltfläche gekommen... Da fliegt einem das Trommelfell weg. Echt uncool.Ebenfalls sehr ungünstig platziert ist der Fingerabdruck Sensor. Sehr schmal und ganz weit unten. Da das Telefon aufgrund des 2:1 Displayformat Recht lang ist, hat es eine ganz gute Hebelwirkung, wenn man es beim Entsperren per Fingerabdruck mit nur einer Hand halten will... Ich musste daher auf das Entsperrmuster zurückgreifen, da das Entsperren per Fingerabdruck einfach zu unhandlich/unergonomisch ist, insbesondere wenn man mal mit dem Daumen ""rumfriemeln"" muss bis der Sensor den Finger richtig erkennt.Apropos unergonomisch. Die Positionierung der Lautstärke-Wippe ist ebenfalls absolut unglücklich. Beim normalen halten des Geräts ist diese nämlich ohne umgreifen nicht (zumindest extrem unbequem) zu bedienen. Wäre diese unterhalb des Power Knopfes oder beide Schalter insgesamt etwas weiter unten angebracht, wäre es deutlich besser zu bedienen (wie z.B. beim Nexus 6)....warum also habe ich mir dieses Telefon überhaupt gekauft und es behalten? Nun, da sich mein altes Handy sehr spontan verabschiedet hat musste was neues her. Da ich möglichst pures Android wollte, Nokia aber 6 Wochen Lieferzeit hatte und mir ein Google Pixel 2 einfach nicht das Geld wert war, musste es gezwungenermaßen dieses hier sein. Und aufgrund der Kratzer kommt eine Rücksendung definitiv nicht mehr infrage.Eigentlich war ich ja Motorola Fan (hatte vorher ein Nexus 6) nach diesem hier wird es voraussichtlich das letzte gewesen sein. Jenachdem was sich auf dem Handy Markt tut werden sich mein und der Weg vom g6 Plus dann bald auch wieder trennen.']"

Da ich aber schon lange auf der Suche nach qualitativen farbechten Fotos bin, stieß ich durch positive Rezensionen auf das Huawei p20 pro. Ich habe es mir gekauft und ich muss sagen, ich habe es nicht bereut. Abgesehen vom schicken Design in der Farbe Twiligth ist im Lieferumfang ein durchsichtiges Gelcover zum Schutz enthalten. (Kennt man von Samsung nicht). Zudem bietet sich die Möglichkeit aufgrund des Dualsteckplatzes, eine zweite Simkarte zu integrieren. In den Einstellungen kann man bspw. Anrufe intern weiterleiten und die Nutzung der Simkarten manuell steuern. So lässt sich beim Huawei p20 pro z. Bsp. eine private und geschäftliche Nutzung zweier Simkarten gut kombinieren. Die Aufrüstung (bei Samsung von 32 GB) auf 128 GB ist für mich als Fotofreak von enormen Vorteil, auch wenn der Speicher leider nicht erweiterbar ist. Um Kontakte und Apps vom Vorgängerhandy zu duplizieren, braucht man im Fall einer anderen Handy Marke (wie bei mir Samsung) eine Clone App. Beim Huawei p20 pro ist sie bereits vorinstalliert. Über dem Appstore kann man kostenlos die gleiche App auf das alte Handy laden. Bei Aktivieren der NFC Verbindung werden alle Apps, Kontakte und Dokumente aus den eigenen Dateien problemlos auf das neue Handy kopiert. Eine WLAN-Verbindung sowie die Einrichtung eines Googlekontos (sofern noch nicht vorhanden) muss manuell eingerichtet werden. Die Zusatzfunktionen der Kamera haben mich absolut überzeugt. Die Farbtreue gegenüber dem Naturell ist sehr echt, sehr intensive und klare Farben. Mit der Blendfunktion kann man ein Objekt beliebig fokussieren, alles andere tritt je nach Einstellung verschwommen in den Hintergrund. Ich als Hobbyfotograf bin von den Zusatzfunktionen sowohl bei der Bild-als auch der Videoeinstellung  absolut begeistert. Ein grosses Lob an dieser Stelle an Huawei. Samsung kann da leider nicht mithalten. Etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig ist allerdings die Tastatur und der entgegensetze Button zum Hauptmenü. Aber das ist reine Übungsssache und wird sich schnell einpegeln. Huawei bietet noch einen Vorteil gegenüber Samsung. Ich bin gezwungen, die Displaybeleuchtung heller als empfohlen, einzustellen. Bei Samsung brennt sich durch diese Einstellung die Tastatur (wenn man viel schreibt) ins Display und bei ungünstigen Lichtverhältnissen kann man diese wie ein Abdruck sehen. Beim Huawei ist mir das noch nicht aufgefallen.Fazit: rundum eines tolles Handy mit edlem Design und kleiner Profikameraausrüstung. Auch die Akkuleistung verdient ein grosses Lob. Selbst bei viel Bedienung hält der Akku locker zwei Tage. Ein vollständiger Ladevorgang dauert knappe 1.5 Stunden, absolut akzeptabel.Beim Preisvergleich (ohne Simlock) führt Amazon den Preis derzeit an die Spitze.Danke auch für die Liefertreue, die in der angekündigten Lieferzeit 3 Tage früher erfolgte.', 'Super téléphone, fonctionnalité appareils photos vraiment intéressante je recommande !', 'I have been an iPhone user since the very first day it was launched and in that time have had every iteration of the iPhone up to the X.I tried Android phones a couple of times but was underwhelmed, however this phone has changed all of that.I bought it as I use the camera on my phone a lot, for me its the most important function other than the phone of course.Incidentally this phone also has 2 SIM cards which I need as I live between 2 countries.This phone takes fantastic pictures and is especially good in low light situations.The build quality is exceptional and it has a striking colour scheme (twilight).In the past I felt Apples closed environment was preferable but now Android has more than caught up.I was particularly impressed with how easy it was to make the transfer for iOS to Android. Merely place the 2 phones on top of each other open the phone clone app and wait, after about 20 minutes my new Android was virtually he same as my old iPhone X but about £300 cheaper. Thats a lot to to pay for a name!Other than that there is little to say.Sound = *****Build = *****Camera = *****Ease of transfer and use = *****Dual SIMSo far there has been nothing to complain about this phone. If it carries on in this manner I will be sticking to Android.Apple are producing a dual SIM phone this year but new features like this always seem to lag behind Android whereas in the past Apple was head of the pack.Sorry Apple, you lost me...', ""De très belles finitions.

Overall impression is that Huawei Support Actually Cares about their Customers... Apple & Samsung could learn loads!Upgrades have added more & more ads which I find annoying as they are forced until time out/skip option.. That and the political situation with USA are the only negatives so far and I'm almost 2 years in.  Battery is still very good too.

The other problem is that the phone itself goes to sleep - there is no option to extend the ""awake"" time to more than 10 minutes!

The LG V30 is deemed ""water resistant for up to 30 min"" in a certain shallow depth of water.  I tentatively tried taking a couple of short underwater vids in my swimming pool when I first got this phone in January 2018.  I bought an unlocked version for the then-discounted price of $750.  I thought I\'d try the water resistance test while my phone was still under LG\'s extended 2-year warranty.  Worked fine.  No issues.  Tried it again this past weekend and my screen went black.  Then, the phone died and would not reboot at all.  Crap.  I found this replacement on Amazon, ordered it Saturday and it arrived Sunday afternoon.  I\'m already with T-Mobile, so I don\'t mind that it\'s a T-Mobile phone.  One big difference between this one and my water damaged unlocked V30 is that I was never able to update to 9.0 Pie.  I was stuck with 8.0 Oreo.  Not that it was bad, but I stopped getting security updates after March 2018 as well, which was frustrating.The main point I\'m trying to make is that for the $229 or whatever it was that I paid, this LG V30 is still an outstanding phone.  I just couldn\'t bring myself to spend a grand on a new Samsung, even though I gave myself the perfect excuse to by ruining my original V30, but the fact is, I love this phone so much I couldn\'t resist the chance to buy another brand new one at such a bargain basement price.  I\'m thrilled.My original water damaged V30 is being repaired locally for a total of $90 and I\'ll be happy to have it back as a spare.  I couldn\'t really detect any bloatware on this phone, either, other than the T-Mobile splash screen which I don\'t care for.  Other than that, no complaints whatsoever..  It shipped with 7.0 for the OS but I had no problem upgrading to Pie 9.0 and got all the security updates.  I purchased an Urban Armor Gear cover and a Supershieldz glass screen protector to take good care of this purchase.  I never found a screen protector I liked until now, so my first V30 got a couple of minor scratches on the screen that never really bothered me, but I learned the hard way that as tough as Gorilla Glass 5 is, it is still susceptible to scratches of you put your phone in your pocket with a set of keys or whatever.  Anyway, excellent experience with this purchase.  Very, very happy.', ""I am a fan of the V-series LG phones. I had a LG V10 phone for several years which I very much enjoyed. I wanted to upgrade but not break the bank, so I opted for the LG V 30.Pros of this phone:- Great OLED display. Not as good as Samsung but better than the displays on the V10 and V20.- Very good battery life. I can make it a whole day on a charge with moderate use. Has quick charge.- Amazing rear facing camera, including an optical wide angle lens and great software.- Hardware that still feels fresh and is capable of multitasking, playing games and running any app.- Clean, sleek design. Very light weight for a phone this size. Wrapped in Gorilla glass 5.- Quad DAC for the best plugged in headphone sound on the market. Nothing comes close to how good this quad DAC sounds.- USB C!- Expandable memory.- Android Pie is now available for the T-Mobile version!- No concerns about the bootloop issue that affected the V10s, V20s and the LG G4s.Cons of this phone:- Front facing camera is just OK. If you take lots of selfies, you may be disappointed but it is serviceable.- Android purists may not like the LG overlay.- Single, bottom firing, speaker. It sounds good but not great.- 3.5mm headphone jack is in the top of the phone. I prefer it to be on the bottom. Just my preference.For 250 dollars, this is an amazing flagship phone. It updated to Android Oreo, so I'm good with it for now. Pie is supposed to becoming soon for T Mobile V30s.Shipped new in a sealed box. It came with a SIM card, quick charger, USB C cable, instructions, and cheap LG headphones.Again, for the price point, you really can't go wrong with this phone. I highly recommend this for budget minded shoppers who want high end performance at a reasonable price."", 'I\'ve had this phone since April 7. After I asked the vendor several questions about the phone, it arrived quickly.  There are several features that distinguish the V30.  It\'s fast, for one.  No hesitation or delays disrupt its performance.  The battery usually lasts more than a full day.  I routinely check email, Facebook, read the news and  and watch You Tube.  The camera is exceptional for several reasons.  Its wide-angle lens and slow motion features are enjoyable to use, and its photo quality is first-rate.  I\'ve called LG several times for questions about its use, and their associates have been accessible and helpful.Another word about the vendor.  They were always quick to respond and were very helpful.  If the phone gives me any significant difficulty within the first year, I\'ll be sure to write a second review, but for now, it deserves its 5-star rating.  Update, April 15:  Somehow the drop-down silence command has disappeared, leaving only the vibrate mode.  ""Hey Google"" voice command works on only the battery saver ""off"" mode.  Neither observation is a deal breaker; still an outstanding phone for the previously mentioned reasons.  It\'s now June 2020.  Both issues are resolved.  The silent mode returned to the drop-down menu, and by going full battery mode, ""Hey Google"" voice activation works.  LG should realize this.  The phone continues to work flawlessly.  19 months after the purchase: this phone has performed flawlessly.  Terrific photos, online banking, videos, remote printing, pairing with wireless speakers, GPS travel, video chats, texting, fast charging, music, and, finally, learning endlessly with Google.I realize this may sound frivolous to younger people, but to me, an older guy, all this was science fiction when I was growing up.  I\'m amazed this device has performed so well.  July 2021:. Still a supurb device with no signs of slowing down.  Photos are excellent, particularly the wide-angle shots.  Pays to buy a flagship phone.  All aspects of performance are solid, no stuttering or delays.  I feel zero need to replace it.  One of my best buys ever.', ""I've owned an LG V20 for a couple years & have been very pleased with it. A few weeks ago, it literally went up in smoke. Per the repair tech it was either a bad charging cable, or a bad charging multi port box.As I am low income & loved the V20 I looked for a new 30 or 40 here. Found this brand new in box V30 at a great price.Pro's:1. While the dac hasn't burned in yet, I ASSUME like the V20 this is probably the best sounding phone in existence for music. It has a 192/24 quad Digital/Analog convertor. I have not spent significant time with the music player yet. I mostly use it for walks in the park, & the local park is not safe at this time2. Faster than the V203. Smaller than the V204. Call quality is similar to the V20, & the speakerphone feature is an upgrade.5. Seems to charge faster than the V206. Android 9 (though this seems to be a downgrade from the V20's Android 8)Cons:1. It frequently forgets passwords.2. The most irritating thing: On Wi-fi The V20 like all other phones would find the fastest option & connect. The V30 often randomly connects to the slowest option, even after I've connected to my home wi-fi. This is truly irritating.3. The battery is NOT replaceable. When it goes, it's bye bye phone.I chose this for the price, but as cheap as the V60's have gotten, I'm wondering if that would have been a better choice."", ""This phone still looks and performs great in spite of being a little long in the tooth.  I wanted a nice phone with a good camera, sound quality, and great performance, all with decent battery life.  And I didn't want to pay $500+ to get it.  I've enjoyed LG phones since the G3 many years ago, so I decided to pick up this V30 to see if it could meet my needs.  Glad I did! It may not be a screaming fast S10, but this phone is by no means a slouch. Camera is awesome, and battery life is respectable so far, as it gets me through the day with medium usage and leaves me with enough juice for bedtime reading.Just be prepared, as T-Mobile has pushed a LOT of updates for this phone since it was released.  It took me several hours of updates to finally get it to Android 9 via OTA updating.This phone is incredible, even in 2020.  Just be aware it's likely not going to be getting Android 10 in the future, considering its release date was so long ago.Also be aware it no longer qualifies for the LG Second Year promise as of April 2019.  Lame."", 'The phone arrived in excellent condition. This was a new ""old stock"" phone. The box was sealed (not shrink wrapped) with a sticker. The phone and accessories (charge and cable...no headphones or case) were in brand new condition. The battery was completely flat upon first opening but charged up well and appears to be holding a charge just fine.

Purchased a ""like new"" version about 2 months ago which had some very minor scratches on the rear cover.  The battery life if phenomenal.  I\'ve yet to have this phone die on me.  Fingerprint / power button on the back is very nice.  On T-Mobile, after a couple of updates it\'s running at Android 9.  The screen resolution is higher than most and it easily runs dual screens, eg: Waze and Spotify while driving.  A real headphone jack, and so far it\'s survived a couple of hard drops from about 2 feet.  Phone docs say it will survive 80% of the drops from shoulder height, but I\'d rather not try it.  Bluetooth, wireless and gps all work well.  The speaker\'s sound quality is very good, but not great.  The camera is fantastic with two different lenses,  one normal, and one widescreen.  Well worth the discounted price I paid.  Would highly recommend.', 'I received my LG V30 Sept 8th 2019.  It arrived new as what showed in the description.  The phone arrived quickly and was well packaged.  Initially I thought the battery life was terrible, but after use it seemed to improve and it really does last all day plus some when it is on battery saver mode, in that mode I can still make calls, text, play games, listen to music, and watch movies.  It simply removes the ""always on"" display of the date, time, and battery life, so I can deal with that.  I also couldn\'t use Map My Run until I took it off of Battery Saver Mode.  It is currently running Andriod 9 and I have the  T-Mobile version of the phone.  It works good on the Tmobile network.  The only problem I have on this phone which probably is a Tmobile app issue is having my Visual Voicemails automatically updated.  Besides that I am very happy with this phone.', ""I bought this phone from the seller Wireless Experts, Inc and am so far happy with my purchase after almost a week of use. Phone arrived new in box with a TMobile SIM card. Was able to activate with no issues. I've been researching phones for awhile to replace my Galaxy S5. I'm not the person who goes out and buys the latest and greatest phone every year or two. I don't believe in spending more than, say, 400 dollars (tops) on my phone. I look for a good deal and keep my phones until they become borderline unusable, haha. This phone has a beautiful screen, great sound, and functions exactly like I hoped it would. The only thing I really miss is the LED notification light, but I'm learning to live without it and it's been okay. My mom has an S8, which many people compare to this phone, and I prefer this one. Great value right now, and I recommend the seller Wireless Experts Inc.""]"

The sound is brilliant, much better than my previous Sony Xperia XZ and the camera takes great photos too. The apps edge feature is also very handy and the screen resolution is brilliant. I've found the battery to hold its charge very well, although I haven't used it for anything too demanding. The wireless charging works very well in my car and with the new wireless charger I bought for my desk at work. The fast charger that comes with the phone charges it so quickly. I think I'll be able to get away with just charging it at work via the wireless charger when required and that should last until the next day when I get to work.I've found the phone to be very fast and responsive with no lagging so far. There are also some very handy tools for helping the phone run smoother, such as putting apps to sleep that haven't been used for a certain amount of time. I'd certainly recommend this phone, especially at its current price on Amazon of £569 (reduced from £739).The only thing that I found rather odd is the placement of the sound rocker. I'm right handed and they're located on the upper left side of the phone, so it can be a little awkward adjusting the volume. I'm also not sure if the Bixby feature needed a physical button on the side of the phone, especially as you can access this by swiping in from the left hand side of the screen."", 'Suppose to get Titanium Grey but I received color Black.. other than the color it seems to be working well 👍', 'I like the Samsung line and I am happy with my phone.

I simply opened it up and popped in my sim card and it was connected to my phone network freedom mobile. Easy to transfer your stuff with the samsung switch app so I transferred my instagram, photos, snapchat, whatsapp ect... to the new phone easily took like 5 minutes.The box itself came with headphones, usb adapters, and fast charge cable .Phone itself is really good the battery last about a day and half with limited use I only really need to charge it once a day. So probably you could get 8- 10 hours with continued use and 24 hours with limited use for you need to charge.The camera is super HD looks really nice and has a lot of features like slow mo, professional ect...The screen looks really nice has different brightness setting and resolution settings depending on how much battery you want to save.Phone is super nice for the price point even if it is 2 years old.

As mentioned I previously had galaxy s7 which met a undignified end, this phone, as expected, is considerably better than the s7 I previously had so was a worthy replacement that is not as mentally priced as the newer releases but still gives some nice new features to play with, which I won't bother writing about as they're listed in the product description.If it does within the warranty period, I'll edit my post."", ""Do not trust this seller.

I have dropped calls and I can't make calls because of terrible reception. For the few calls I can make the other person keeps telling me they hear every other word.  I am beyond disappointed.  Normally Samsung S Phones are reliable out of the box.  I suspect this phone was not a new phone and was likely refurbished even though it was sold as a new phone.  In retrospect we should have been suspicious that the box seemed a bit tattered and it was not sealed like a new product.  I was naive to think maybe it was only the box and who would purposely sell a damaged product.  Upon reading why phones lose reception consistently when similar phones have great reception is usually due to the phone having been dropped or worse having water damage, and/or was refurbished.  I suspect this phone was not a new phone.  My husband originally bought this phone via my account as a gift which is why we did not notice the issues right away and in time to return.""]"

I always use high end phones and was currently using the Pixel 2 XL before this phone. From an aesthetics standpoint, this phone blows the Pixel away but my problem is EMUI.Here are the things I love;1) In my opinion, this is the nicest looking phone on the market and it feels great in the hand. A major plus for this.2) Call quality is excellent. I think it gets better reception and sound great on both ends.3) Battery & Fast charging. I won't dive too deep into this but this phone is a beast on battery life. I typically have at least 40% remaining by the time I go to bed where in the past, I would have had to put a phone on the charger. Kudos for this.4) The speakers sound really good. Not quite as loud as the Pixel, but that is because the lower speaker is on the bottom. Still, it sounds really good.5) Pretty easy setup with the Huawei smart switch but Android is petty easy anyway. Still, took about a half hour to transfer everything.6) Fingerprint scanner is the fastest and most accurate I have ever seen. This is important to me since EMUI does not support Smart Lock. More on that in the negatives.Now the negatives;1) I'm not a huge fan of EMUI. It is a lot better than it used to be, but I feel like I need a manual to figure it all out. Tons of hidden menus / sub menus2) Scrolling video works poorly. I am not referring to watching a video or live stream, I am referring to events. I use Nest cameras and could normally scroll through events. On this phone, it just turns black and blurry. I've tried this on two different phones and they are exactly the same. On the Pixel 2, as well as my wife's Iphone, it scrolls perfectly. It has nothing to do with the wifi or signal either as both are great. Just keep this in mind if you are using a Nest camera system.3) My call blocker is useless with EMUI. I have tried every setting suggested by TrueCaller, and nothing works. All calls come right through. This could be a deal breaker for me as I am overwhelmed with solicitations and spam calls. There is an internal blocker but I need specific types of calls blocked.4) Alerts are hit or miss. Sometime you get them, and sometimes you don't as evidenced by my Ring Pro doorbell. This is both in the office, and home. I have done  a hard reset, cleared the cache, and also tried reinstalling the app. This is not a deal breaker but I don't understand why it does not work all of the time.5) EMUI does not use the android smart lock feature. In my opinion, this is one of the best features of android. Basically the system is programmed to know and trust you so it will not lock in the designated areas.This feature does not exist in EMUI except a bluetooth function that sort of does a similar function, but only works half of the time. If you are like me, and constantly picking up your phone, and putting it down, it is an extra step to have to always unlock it. I have no idea why Huawei would not use the android smart lock function.Ok, so I am not saying this is not a great phone. It is but it lacks the specific functions I use and need on a daily basis. I am trying to love it, and still not sure if I will keep it or not but if I am unable to get a bit more consistency from it, I think it's going back. I will give it a couple of weeks to see if the AI chip learns or changes anything. Just my opinion for what it's worth.Edit 3/4/18I really tried to like this phone, and unfortunately, I really do like it. However, after several attempts with Huawei to get the blockers working, and the issues with my notifications, the phone is going back. I tried everything from factory resets, to any and all possibilities. More than I have ever done to try to get this phone to work as needed.I could honestly say that this could be my favorite phone I have ever used but the lack of necessary features just kill it for me. Back it goes."", ""A VERY Beautiful BrickThis is a very beautiful paperweight.  It excels at everything EXCEPT actually being a phone. I'll provide a quick summary for people who just want the overview then go into detail below. As an FYI - I replaced the first phone after three weeks.  Called in to return the second after 4 days.PROSSpeedy.  Responsive. Beautiful.CONSCan't maintain a Bluetooth connection. Can't maintain a call over Wi-Fi.  Can't maintain a call over cellular.  Can't receive calls.  Transferring apps and data to the phone does not work well.  Only partially transferred  data, then stopped working. Piss poor customer support. Does not come with visual voicemail installed.Here's the message I sent to HUAWEI about the details.  These messages were after the calls.DETAILSPhone #1 - 1) the phone clone app does not connect.  Getting a connection so I can copy the contents of my other phone over where painful and took forever.  Does not work as advertised. 2) Dropped Bluetooth connections and would during calls, people would complain of not being able to hear me. Even though I could hear them. Then they'd hang up. Because they couldn't hear me. 3) would lose internet connection.  Customer support would only tell me to factory reset or send phone in to be serviced.  So I would either lose my data. Or have people not be able to contact me for a week.  I returned this phone to Amazon and got a new on on Friday (March 16th).Phone #2 - 1) loses internet connection.  Even though it says it's connected to the internet it loses internet connection.  2) after several minutes on the phone, people were complaining of not being able to hear me and then they would disconnect the phone because they thought the phone call had ended..  After unsuccessful attempts to receive help from Huawei support, I was able to determine that calls made over Wi-Fi would be the ones where people complained of not being able to hear me.  All of my other phones are able to do this without an issue, but the Huawei phone is unable to handle this.  3). Now this is the BIG ONE.  All of a sudden, this phone stopped receiving phone calls.  I had very important calls coming in and this phone wouldn't even register that a phone call has been made to me. I can call out just fine (as long as I talk fast enough to get my message out before the phone decides to mute me).  But this phone refuses to accept calls now.FYIFor both phones, Huawei suggested I reset the phone.  Even the one that was fresh out of the box. Only 4 days old.  They didn't offer much beyond that.Do not get this phone if you're not already an expert at setup or are new to Android.  Or if you need to call people."", 'Styling is slick, screen is big and overall is usually quite fast. Always get compliments on the appearance.

Disclaimer I am a blackberry and iPhone person but have also used everything else made by major companies. I\'ve used the mate 8, 9, 10 pro and now the standard mate 10.I like this over the mate 10 pro for the simple reason that the screen is a true 16:9 ratio. Almost all of YouTube and other content is in this format and I like the full screen being utilized without any letterbox issues.Speed wise they are the same. Battery wise I see no difference.The screen on this doesn\'t quite ""pop"" as much being an LCD but to me it actually seems sharper. I was able to distinguish pixels on the pro version and I cant on this.The 4gb of ram is plenty adequate for everything I\'ve thrown at it. I use blackberry software on this including the hub which is very ram intensive and have no issues.The camera on this phone is amazing. If you like the simplicity of a point and shoot in auto mode, it may not be better than an iPhone 8 or X, but close.

PROS: powerfull hardware (not the best but more than requier for almost everything you trow at), IPS diplay in my case i prefer realistic colors than the OLED cause i do a lot of photgraphy with it, dual sim (i do not use it) but i do use the second slot for my SD to store lots of content (microSD, up to 256 GB, uses SIM 2 slot), front facing fingerprint scanner that i use a lot when wonking in my desk pc, headphone connector which i love so i can use my existing hifi headphones (sound is great, very good D/A converter), Non-removable Li-Po 4000 mAh battery wich get you to end of the day with almost 1/4 life with more than usual use, simulated stereo speakers using the auricular one just for high reproduction (not the best but better than just the one facing botton), IR that can control almost any divice TVs, ACs, Recivers, etc., and the last thing i like a lot is the pc mode with just a cable adapter from USB-C to HDMI that is about $9 to 15 here in amazon. I do want to say that it includes a silicon acrilic case that i am using. CONS: Because of the glass back finish it is very slippery so you need to use a covercase, very dirty with fingerpints and it is a bit heavy. I hope you found this info usefull.

Battery life is not the best out there, but it's more than enough for a full day of use ...still better than a 6 Plus. And it has 2 battery saving modes (battery saver and extreme battery saver).The only sort-of downside... It has some bloatware apps that can't be deleted. I haven't had it jail-broken or anything... yet. Maybe jailbreak will help delete the apps?

(google maps is a god awful battery drain) The only thing that has taken some  getting  used to is the single button control, but once you get used to it I actually like it better than my previous phones.

I did not receive a Moto G7+, I received a Tmobile Revvlry.  The hardware may be the same, the form factor is, but due to the software it's a very different phone.  I'm not even sure if it's better or worse, but very different with a distinct learning curve to it.  It seemingly does everything differently.  If I knew I wasn't going to get the same phone I probably would not have ordered it.  Thanks.  For nothing.Time for a battery, the case was bulging quite a bit, probably due to being on the charger all the time.  I've replaced batteries in half a dozen cellphones before so I thought no big deal.  Wrong, big deal.#1.  Pry the screen off very carefully.  Not just carefully, very carefully.#2.  In spite of the online instructions to do so, do not remove the connector for the screen, it's really difficult to reinstall, and there's no need.  Obviously disconnect the connector for the battery and use heat or alcohol to aid in removing the battery.  You may need adhesive to reattach the screen, it doesn't just snap or.  Repeat, do not remove the connector for the screen, you will give yourself grief if you do.First impressions so I may edit the review later, but I wanted to get this out there because of all the case questions.The phone seems good, it's got a nice quality feel to it, similar to an iphone, maybe not quite, but nothing like the cheap plastic phones, it's got a good feel.  Minimal use so far, but it works well and hasn't done anything wrong.  Plugged in a Tmobile sim card, it recognized it right away and started downloading VM's that hadn't come thru on the old iphone.  I'm sure dedicated phone enthusiasts would readily be able to tell the difference between this and the $1000+ high end phones, but it's got good specs, an Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 636 Processor – 1.8 GHz Octa-Core processor and expandable to 512G with a micro SD card.  It's a nice phone for a burner price.Cases.  This one fits fine, https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087ZVRYFQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1Yes it's a round hole for an oval camera, but it's large enough so it's not a problem.  There is a little bit of extra space at the top and bottom of the oval, but insignificant in my mind.  Wife's phone so the case is pink, I assume other colors fit the same.  Do be careful as there are options for a variety of similar, but different phones on that same page, but the one we got was the one specified for this phone and it fits just fine."", '𝕋𝕙𝕖 𝔾𝕠𝕠𝕕The bootloader is indeed unlockable, contrary to what other reviews have indicated.  There\'s an unlock process on Motorola\'s website that entails using fastboot to pull OEM info from the phone, providing that to Motorola, and they then email you an unlock key.  Full instructions can be found on LineageOS\' website (search online for ""LineageOS lake"" - ""lake"" being the codename for this device), though I\'ll note I had to add an extra step: the ""final"" \'fastboot oem unlock KEY\' command complained about needing to enable bootloader unlocking in Settings, so I needed to boot the phone normally, then connect to WiFi before I could change that particular setting (after which I was able to reboot back into the bootloader and run the unlock command).Seems to run pretty smoothly with LineageOS 18.1 (Android 11).  It\'s only been running for a couple days, but battery life, performance, screen quality, and camera quality all seem to be pretty good, especially considering the price tag.𝕋𝕙𝕖 𝔹𝕒𝕕It was a royal pain to flash the temporary recovery to install LineageOS, specifically because the bootloader\'s USB connection is sketchy as heck.  None of the USB ports (type A or type C) on my laptop did the trick with any of the cables under Windows or Linux (openSUSE); thankfully it was more cooperative with my work Macbook\'s docking station.  The LineageOS install instructions mentioned this for this particular device, but it was definitely weird how thoroughly uncooperative it was.  Once the phone\'s booted (either normally or into recovery) the USB connection is a lot more reliable.𝕋𝕙𝕖 𝕌𝕘𝕝𝕪The plastic body is tolerable (albeit chintzy), except for the fact that it\'s way too smooth for its own good.  Even so much as setting it down on a slightly uneven surface will result in it sliding around - in one case, off a work surface and onto a linoleum floor (which thankfully didn\'t result in any noticeable damage, though it somehow caused the phone to reboot).The bootloader unlock process is needlessly complex (per above), but it at least exists and it did (with some finagling) work, so I can\'t complain too much there.𝕋𝕙𝕖 𝕍𝕖𝕣𝕕𝕚𝕔𝕥My old phone (a OnePlus 5T) went kaput, and this happened to be an ostensibly-LineageOS-compatible phone that\'d be in my hands the next day.  Given the pricetag, the LineageOS compatibility, and being available in a pinch, I\'m glad I bought it.  Should tide me over until my Astro Slide 5G finally arrives.', 'I bought this phone priced at $150, and overall it’s a really good phone, especially for the price. My main phone is the iPhone XS and I use this moto one for leisure.Battery: it’s kinda a downer when I charge it to 100% but then quite literally 2 minutes go by and it’s already down to 99%. While using it actively though, I get at least 4-5 hours before I start charging it again. The major plus is that it charges super fast. It could be at 20% and I leave it on for 30 minutes, and it’s already almost done charging. It does warm up a bit if you’re charging and using it at the same time, so I recommend just solely charging it without use.Screen quality: one of the best I’ve seen. It’s just as good as my iPhone (if not better), and the screen is nice and large so you get the most out of it. The notch at the top is hardly noticeable as well.Audio: nice! It comes from both the bottom speakers and the top so it sounds really good when you listen to music, but you can tell it sounds a bit dingy in high-volume action scenes compared to other devices—but nothing that takes away too much from the overall experience.Ease of use: very smooth controls and many convenient options for shortcuts and commands (I’ve already done the two swipe thing for the flashlight on my iPhone only to be sorely disappointed that the light didn’t turn on ^_^).Camera: not quite the best to say the least. I don’t mind though since I don’t use the phone for pictures, but the times I have used it, the quality wasn’t as good compared to what I’m used to. But, it definitely gets the job done plus, I might not be using it to the best of its capabilities since I’m not used to Motorolas.Weight: it’s surprisingly lightweight for its size. I can hold it for hours and not feel too much strain on my wrists or fingers. I have small hands, and I can hold this phone just fine and reach across the screen easily with just my thumb.Hope this helped! I’ve had it for about a month now and do not regret purchasing it!!', 'I have only been using it for about 4 weeks and evrything is working just fine.  There is one major isuue.  It eats sd cards.  I have used more sd cards in cellphones than I can remember and have never experienced this before.  I had already read a review that mentioned this issue and was extremely careful when placing the sd card in the tray and very carefully pushed the tray in.  When I checked the portable storage ,sd card, it did not show any installed.  I reopened the tray and it was gone, it disappeared into the phone.  I took the tray out and the sd card was missing.  I then turned the phone so that the tray opening was facing down and shook it figuring that it waould fall out but it did not.  I then placed a second sd card into the tray that I had laying around, although it had much less memory, and again carefully pushed it in and fortunately it stayed in the tray and was recognized.  The first sd card that was purchased specifically for this phone and eaten by the phone was 64 gb, the second was only 16 gb.  Despite there being a sd card lost within the phone it fortunately is functioning just fine, so far.  I now have a fraction of sd storage that I wanted and needed and have a sd card somewhere inside that will not come out, that cannot be good.  I would like to remove the smaller installed 16 gb card and replace it with a larger 64 gb card but am afraid to.  What will happen if it eats another sd card?  Will it still function with 2 lost sd cards inside of it?  Again I have installed MANY sd cards in cellphones over more years and have never had this happen before.  Apparently this phone has a major flaw in the design of the sd card tray.  Even being aware or this issue and being extremely carefull and experienced it can still happen.', ""I have owned this Motorola mobile over a year and still think it's not a bad deal for a short term use. It's not a 5G product but can work with 4G service. I especially like the turbo speed charging on the phone battery for not an hour, but maybe 20 minutes for a full charge from zero percent. It's not easy for me to find the same feature on other Motorola models that I would consider lately. The device is light weighted and the phone cover bought for the mobile keeps the tear and wear to a minimal. The mobile comes with NFC technology and I can pay with Google Wallet at the stores, provided the store registers got updated (not at Lowe's)! However, my online sign-in with fingerprint does not always work for me, especially when I already forgot my account password, so I had to reset those passwords again and again! Overall, I am happy for the purchase but will have to look for another device compatible with 5G in 2023."", '+2 month update - I\'m giving up.  Just got back from Europe and everything just worked on that sim care.  Back to US and told again today ""Unlocked phones don\'t support ATT features"".  So I think they are basically blocking advanced features somehow by parsing my IMEI and knowing it is not an ATT phone.  Very disapointing.  Now have to swollow my pride and only buy ATT phones (or iPhones, which I hear don\'t have this problem), in the future.  :-(Dropping from 4 to 3 starts.  Still great phone if you don\'t need advanced features.--X--X--High level summary is that AT&T does not believe this phone supports VoLTE (Voice Over LTE).  After several chats with support (AT&T and Motorola), I\'m accepting ""H"" (3G plus) data speed instead of ""LTE"" (4G) as there does not seem to be a way to make this work.  But, many things seem to work:  - Hotspot, Wifi, H Mobile data  - Calls, Voice mailNot working:  - VoLTE, LTE data  - wifi calling, conf callingPlus you also get the reasonable cost, good battery life, and reasonable processor speed and display.  I also like the 32GB of data, as my old 16GB was feeling tight.The longer story (not for the faint of heart)...I had a Moto G6 Play from AT&T and it worked like a champ.  I wanted more space, so I got a Moto G6 Play with 32 GB from Amazon.  After several customer service tries, I returned it as I could not get LTE data or Hotspot to work at all.  On the Motorola site, the G6 Play was a ""hollow check mark"" that generally means it works with AT&T but may not support all features.OK, so the G7 Play was a little more $$ but it was a ""solid check mark"" that should mean fully supported.Plugged in the SIM card day one, and saw LTE and thought I was good to go.  Next day, only got H again and called support.  Did lots of trys with AT&T, and saw LTE again when I moved the SIM card from Slot1 to Slot2, but one day later and back to only H.From Motorola and AT&T (and I don\'t 100% understand this) the problem seems to be that VoLTE (Voice Over LTE) is required to prevent cell calls from forcing your data to change to a different band.  Sounds like this means you have a hard time using data with voice, so they drop back to a lower data rate to put the calls on another band.It seems like the ""Dual Sim"" is the issue.  This is tuned for European bands instead of US bands and that somehow causes issues with LTE for AT&T.  I have checked the band maps and cannot figure out what the G7 Play is missing, but it sure seems like AT&T somehow knows this is a Dual Sim (i.e. not strictly for US) Motorola phone and prevents connecting with the LTE data.  Or, AT&T has rumbles online for basically hobbling unlocked phones from top tier features.  Honestly, I\'m not sure which is really the case.I\'m still giving the phone 4 stars because the H band should be more data speed that I ever need in reality, and this still seems like a good phone.  So I\'m OK with where I am with this phone on AT&T, but buyer beware if you are looking to get LTE data with this phone.  (And if anyone figures out how to really get this working with AT&T, I would love to know.', ""Got this to replace my refurb Droid Maxx so I can only compare to that.I've never spent over 100 on a phone. At first I couldn't stand the phone. Had to disable like five screen security locks. Apparently people are carrying launch codes around. It's a Google phone which somehow missed in the product description and reviews. I personally find Google apps and products to be high maintenance,tedious,cumbersome and intrusive. It takes so long to activate a phone that I was reluctant to return . Was able to download an app to uninstall apps ( 30% of memory was full upon arrival and it shipped with the device turned on which was weird) Had to go to a boost store ,purchase a new SIM card and they called my provider,Page Plus to activate with no problem ( uses Verizon ) was glad I got a screen protector before leaving as it appears fragile. I was able to add the apps I use (Waze doesn't try to open photos and reviews of every business you pass en route to your destination like Google maps)and my email apps. Had to remove gmail factory install as it was interfering with outlook and taking too long to load. (They were trying to sync or something and failing- who knows )The camera is a definite upgrade for me. Seems to take a more full screen photo ,color and lighting true to life which is priority for me as I use it for work. The reception quality slightly below average but functional. People say they can't hear me if I move around while talking and dropped a few calls in my non remote 1 BR home. Sounds like it's on speaker when it's not so the sound on receiving end is louder than average. If a call comes in when youre on the internet it doesn't come up on the screen but tiny in left upper corner so have missed a few calls . Just have to get used to it.The interface is basic and simple which I like and processes tasks quickly. Also the screen goes dark while typing. I'm sure all these things can be set to preference somehow but I feel they should be standard. You have to have a Google account to use the calender that comes with the device. That was the only thing I wasn't able to customize to my liking . 4 stars for occasional dropped calls and why I will likely not buy again. Everything else is very sufficient. Good little phone."", 'Phone was good while it lasted, but barely two and half year in, the battery swelled up!  Definitely a safety hazard.', 'Inicialmente buscaba un buen teléfono con un presupuesto algo apretado, lo principal que me interesaba era la cámara, por lo que al seguir las recomendaciones de internet, decidí comprar un Redmi Note 8, al estar en un buen precio. Al recibirlo y probar sus cámaras, sobre todo la de vídeo, noté una considerable baja calidad, se me hizo bastante extraño, ya que un Motorola G6 Play me daba mejores resultados, por lo que lo devolví. Cuándo encontré este dispositivo no dudé en comprarlo, y me encuentro completamente satisfecho con la compra, la cámara a pesar de ser de una resolución menor que las de otros competidores, tiene un muy buen sensor y prácticamente capta todo como se aprecia sin bajones de calidad. Muchos se quejan porque no encuentran fundas para el dispositivo por la forma del módulo de cámaras, pero con una funda normal y una lijada en el agujero de la cámara se puede ajustar perfectamente. La batería es el punto más débil, pero se compensa al contar con una carga bastante rápida. Llevo más de un mes con él y me ha funcionado bastante bien, si llega al día con un 10 a 15% de batería con un uso normal. Además de que lo usé con una SIM AT&T y todo bien. Completamente recomendada su compra, prácticamente no se encuentra nada igual o más barato en condición de nuevo.']"

I bought it because my old Nexus 6p was dying. Not willing to spend $500 on a phone again, I decided to try out Honor 8, but returned it because it had poor calling quality and was prone to overheat. I bought an ad-free version of Idol 5S here for $220, my score is based on the price.GoodBuild & Design -- As others have said, this looks and feels like $400 phone, not $250 phone. Its look and feel is much better than Moto G5, its main competitor.Speakers&Headphone jack -- This must have the best speaker I have ever heard from a smartphone (though I have never tried boomsound HTCs). Similarly, its headphone output is much better than N6P or H8. I am impressed here.Performance -- It uses Snapdragon625, so don't expect a speed demon here. That being said, it is snappy enough for daily uses and light gaming, and it does not overheat like N6P or H8.USB Type-C -- it is the future, and it supports quickcharge as well.Near stock Android -- although custom skins are getting better nowadays, I still prefer starting from the stock or near-stock Android.FM Radio -- oddly enough, this phone comes with FM Radio, in case you like to use it.MixedScreen -- its screen has a nice colors, especially for a sub $300 phone (I would say it is better than the screen on H8), and it can get very bright. However, it is no match to quality AMEOLED when it comes to production of darker colors.Battery -- it lasts long enough, and having ad-free version helps here according to some user reports. However, it does have relatively small battery.Camera -- it is not bad, especially for a sub $250 phone -- but it is nothing to write home about, and tend to struggle in poor lighting conditions. N6P and H8 performed better here. The front camera is merely serviceable, as well.Tweaks -- its version of Android is near stock, which means there are no useful custom tweaks -- the only exception are the equalizer and the ability to change color tones.(edited) It turned out that Alcatel did add few more common tweaks -- they added the ability to display battery percentage on the status bar (this option is somewhat well-hidden),  and they split the volumes for alarms and notifications. As these are some of the most popular tweaks for Android, they win points here.BadCase&Screen Protector -- as far as I am aware, these don't exist as of now for this phone. This phone is slippery, so you have to be extra careful. Note that many of the cases and screen protectors listed on Amazon ATM are for Idol 5, not for 5S, AFIAK.NFC -- as often with budget phones, there is no NFC here.Lack of future updates -- Alcatel is not known for providing speedy (or any) major Android updates. You are most likely staying with Nougat till the end of time. This is the biggest flaw IMO, though it may change in future.Overall, this is a very good media-focused midrange phone it is a great value if you can buy it under $250."", ""I've been using Alcatel phones for years and I have always appreciated their value. I just cannot justify paying $$$++ for a phone. However, I use my phone for business and I had a customer send me some photos of a piece I did with an accessory she purchased to go with it. Unfortunately this phone says it's 4GLTE compatible, but on my GSM carrier it will only run on the 3G network. Hence, it will not send or receive mms messages - photos, videos, group texts etc. Took me a while to figure out what was going wrong and why none of the texting apps (including the one pre-installed) were working. The 4GLTE stays lit up, but I'm being forced on a 3G server if that makes sense.Also, the touch screen constantly freezes or doesn't recognize my touch. I've never had a phone to do this. It's not a memory issue, even if I sweep the multiple apps left open, it still locks up. Not great when trying to snap a photo, switching between apps or using the back button etc.The 12 mp camera takes less quality photos than a previous Alcatel camera with 10 mp.The only thing nice about the phone is the glass front and back. It makes the phone look like an $800 phone. But good luck finding a case for this glass phone.I will probably trash this phone and downgrade to the 5G I had before this one."", 'The new model I bought is amazing as phone #1 from Alcatel sellers on Amazon.I simply needed a fone with 802.11ac for a new drone I bought from, you guessed it, AMAZON!The phone arrive in new sealed condition works way better than I expected and a great price.Amazon and its sellers are an amazing army of people to make customers absolutely delighted.I purchased the global unlocked version because I visit China often for decades to see friends.These phones are completely reliable and are incredible in build, manufacture, and quality.My other use is for FPV on my drone flying and it is a perfect augment to my hobby.There are good phones out there but the support over many years and Alcatel phones has been EXCELLENT!Bravo Amazon and your sellers as you continue to amaze me at the quality you offer.Imagine the day we get delivery by drone? Life is getting better with Amazon surely!!!Ray C. USA FLORIDA', ""I had the Alcatel One Touch Idol 3 and I liked it very much but unfortunately even though I am quite careful with my phones after 3 years of use something hit the screen and cracked it. I immediately searched on amazon for another Idol model 3 or 4 and came across this one at a GREAT price. The phone looks AWESOME, and the fingerprint reader is a great addition. The screen is quite  bright. Camera a great upgrade too (I had the Idol 3 camera which wasn't that great)The sound coming out of the speakers is VERY good. It can reproduce audio with great fidelity in both low and high frequencies. You can watch your youtube videos or listen to podcasts and it's loud enough to be heard in a large room."", 'Returned item as on-screen keyboard was experiencing issues.  I worked with Alcatel to attempt to resolve this as I thought it may be a possible software/app issue but that was not the case.  All other aspects of the phone seemed to work fine.  Since it could not be sorted out with tech support I decided to send the item back to avoid being stuck with a product that did not work as it should have.  Maybe the one I received was a dud but I am not willing to take the chance.Side note....phone did work on VZW and Tmobile so it would have served as a great backup phone because is supports both CDMA and GSM.  Because of that it earned 3 stars....still being returned though.', ""Now I have only had the for 1 day but wow! It is a value device. I needed something after my s7 stopped holding a charge and this is by far on of the best purchases. I have sprint so I was a little skeptical about a unlocked phone but I am glad I took the plunge. It's light but has a premium feel with the glass and aluminum and the color quality is great. My only issue so far was that I was unable to do the self activation through sprint and actually had to talk to someone which only was a minor inconvenience."", ""At first I was pleased with this phone.  Then a recent update from the manufacturer damaged the phone so it can no longer send texts longer than two sentences. I don't even remember giving permission to update--I woke up one morning to find that it had updated and I couldn't send long texts.  I can't tell you how long I was on the phone over the last two months trying to get the situation straightened out with both T-Mobile and Alcatel. Both blamed the other for the problem, until today,when Alcatel confessed their update had erased the ability of my phone to send out more than a few characters at a time. They said there was no way to fix it and basically told me I was shit out of luck. Too bad, so sad.  I think they should replace my damaged phone. I'll never buy from Alcatel again and do not recommend them to anyone.Edit:  Now Alcatel is denying that the problem is of their making when I asked them to either repair the phone or replace it. They're now saying it's T-Mobile's fault."", ""Not a bad device by any means. It's received a software hosts since its initial launch, so not bad. Not a fan of the silent mode, which, if you try to expand the volume controls, is located just above the drop-down button. Glass back is also quite slippery, but that's to be expected. For the price, it's alright. Speakers are very nice. Display could be brighter in daylight."", 'Great phone so far. One of the reasons I got it was for the 32GB internal memory. But the phone I got only has 2GB internal memory. Just wanted to let you know. Oh, and its still great so far.', 'Muy buen producto, realmente es el producto descrito en la publicacion y la entrega fue realizada de manera correcta y sin daños.']"

It's Android 7, and I just feel like they've really worked out all the little dislikes.  The MicroSD card is useful for storing applications and integrated pretyy painlessly as a default storage area.  The auto updates work as expected, where other devices I have require manual updates despite being set to auto-update.  The network performance with the TMobile network is fine, and speeds reliable.  Battery performance is fine, and I can go several days without charging and I've never seen it below 50% charge.  I also like that it's a fairly minimal and no-frills install of Android.The beauty of this phone is that it has decent performance and the most important sensors like compass, gps, gyroscope that only the more expensive models have.  I've used it for VR games and apps, videos, and all kinds of things.  I've compared it to my sons Samsung S7 Edge and it more than holds it own at half the price.  I am very pleased with the compromise of price and features.  I was a bit hesitant to purchase it because of the brand, until I realized I bought my wife a Huawei phone that has worked perfectly for the past year.The one downside I have is the glass is not a gorilla glass.  I purchased a glass cover for it so I'm ok with that now.  Note that the glass is curved on the edges, so if you purchase a hard cover for it then you will see that on the edges it doesn't make total contact.  This may annoy some, and I thought I would dislike it, but honestly I don't really care now.UPDATE:I now have had this phone for over a year.  It has never let me down, crashed, or had any sort of weird problems.

This fits in your shirt pocket, but probably nowhere else. Not recommended for your back pocket.S O U N D . . .At a time when other manufacturers are eliminating the headphone jack, LG has doubled down on headphones. Literally. Their HiFi Quad DAC (Digital Audio Converters) offer audio quality comparable to high-end audio equipment. Don\'t believe it? LG allows you to return to ordinary phone quality at the touch of a button. Most people can easily hear the improvement.The single internal speaker fires downward. It has great volume and a pleasing timbre tuned by Bang & Olufsen. Of course, it would be better to have stereo speakers, but I like the bottom placement. You can put the phone upside down in your phone holster and hear the audio clearly from your hip. Great for audio podcasts.There is great support for audio recording:o 24-bit stereoo 3 hifi microphoneso Very low noise and high dynamic range (130db)o 2 parallel DACs per channel. For more info, search for the ES9218 DAC from ESS.I love my live recordings.H A R D W A R E . . .This phone has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820, 4GB of fast DDR4 RAM, 64GB of local storage, and is expandable with microSD up to 256GB. This hardware makes on-screen operations very fast. You can plug this phone into your computer and it acts like fast external storage. So, you can quickly download your photos to your computer and upload your mp3s to the phone.Accepts Nano-SIM and MicroSD. Has an IR Blaster so you can use your phone as a remote control. Has Gorilla Glass 4 over the screen. Has a one-touch fingerprint sensor on top of the power button. It is not water resistant.Charge:Supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0. Charge from 0% to 50% in about 30 minutes. From 0% to 90% in about an hour. A reversible USB-C connector supplies power.Battery:Did I mention that the 3200 mAh battery is user replaceable? That allows you to carry a spare when you travel. When the battery loses capacity after a year or two, just replace the battery yourself. If the phone ever gets into the water, remove the battery and let it safely dry out. If the phone is frozen, remove the battery. If you don\'t want to be tracked, remove the battery. LG is the last major manufacturer to offer removable batteries. If you want a spare, search for LG BL-44E1F. The OEM version is $40, 3rd party batteries are much cheaper.Camera:A sweet dual back lens configuration allows you to switch between the normal 16MP 29mm (75 degree) f1.8 back lens, the 12mm (135 degree) 8MP f2.4 wide angle back lens, or the 5MP 120 degree f1.9 front lens. Or, you can combine 2 or 3 of the lenses for great effects. You can zoom smoothly between the 2 back lenses with very effective software interpolation. Laser focus, phase detection focus, contrast auto focus, and electronic image stabilization keep the images sharp. The primary lens sports a 1/2.8"" image sensor, slightly larger than the 1/3"" iPhone 7 image sensor. Although the camera is by far the best I have seen in a phone, and may even be superior to many ""point and shoot"" cameras, don\'t imagine that the 18.5 sq mm sensor area can match a 329 sq mm APS-C DSLR sensor. For convenience, volume keys double as a shutter release. Also, camera controls (Auto, Manual Camera, Manual Video) appear in the secondary screen.S O F T W A R E . . .Android 7 Nougat:This is the first phone released with Android 7.0, Nougat. That provides an improved launcher, with features mostly borrowed from those hundreds of after-market launchers. However, it does also provide a split-screen capability to show 2 apps at the same time. Just hold down the square apps button at the bottom of the screen, and the current app shrinks to 50%, and you can choose the 2nd app to show from the list of recent apps. The 5.7"" primary screen is so big that this feature works pretty well. The most impressive feature is the power savings. When the screen has been off for a while, the phone ""dozes"". In this state, network and app activity are limited. With regular (not intensive) use, I\'m going to bed with 86% power remaining. Very cool! Battery life diminish as you load more apps. Keep it lean.LG Customization:LG\'s Desktop locks the phone with ""Tap, Tap"", and their lock-screen wakes with ""Tap, Tap"". LG\'s smart settings allows you to control the phone (GPS, Wireless Bluetooth, apps) by location and do health tracking (steps, stairs) and summarize all the health and smart settings as a page on the home screen. LG adds 7 mini-apps that can float above the main apps in semi-transparent windows: Phone, Video, Contacts, Messaging, Calendar, EMail, and File Manager. These apps have full size counterparts, and you can toggle them between full-sized and mini.Camera:Camera effects are available, including Panorama, HDR, Timer, Cheese Shutter, Tracking Focus, Optical Image Stabilization, Slo-Mo, Tracking Focus, RAW format and 4K video. I particularly liked the manual focus with green fringing on the items in the focus area (focus peaking). ISO can be manually adjusted between 50-1600 ISO.Bloatware:All the AT&T Bloatware that was locked-down on my previous LG phone is still available, I just have to download it or allow it to be restored from my previous phone. I can delete it without root if I don\'t like it. Google and LG apps remain locked.B A D . . .Size:If you\'re used to a smaller phone, you may not like how tall this phone is. Also, it\'s just wide enough not to fit in holsters made for 5.5"" phones.Glass:On the rear of the phone, over the 2 lenses and 2 flashes, there is a protective glass cover. See photo. A very few users have seen their camera cover glass shatter for no good reason. I checked with LG on the matter, and they\'re not sure what\'s going on, but promise to cover the phone. LG performs 60,000 validation tests on this phone, so no one is more surprised than LG when one fails. I suspect that the glass is in good shape when it leaves the factory, but is weakened by the high heat from sustained use of the adjacent dual flashes. So, let me humbly suggest 3 things:1) Do not leave the flash on. LG provides a flashlight mini-app, so it\'s very easy to turn it on and leave it on for an extended time. Don\'t.2) Keep your phone in a case to provide extra protection.This has proven to be an isolated issue and LG is great about standing behind their products. 14 months and many drops later, my V20\'s glass is still perfect.T I P S . . .Restore the App Drawer:The default home screen does not have an app drawer. Enable the app drawer by clicking:__Settings->Home screen->Select Home->Home & app drawer.Of course, you can switch to any of the hundreds of other launchers in the Google Play Store, but you lose the ""tap, tap"" sleep command. You\'d still retain the ""tap, tap"" wake command.Don\'t add dozens of apps. I did and battery life went from 2 days to 8 hours.\'Enable Individual Ringtones:By default, you can only set one ringtone for your favorite contacts, but not by individual.

But after seeing reviews that the phones people are getting are not as promised I felt the need to review both. I have left shipping feedback as well but feel there is a need to review  my experience.Its a gamble....I will review the phones I received as well as where I picked them up.  While some do not like mixing a review about who sends the phones vs the phone itself, there has to be some ""heads up"" to those  who might be surprised when they actually get the phone.First off the V20 is a nice phone.  A bit smooth so it will easily slide on surfaces.Wide angle camera  has allot of noise  compared to the 16 mp camera.Phone likes to say the SD card is corrupt.  Best to Eject the card and run it on  computer before you think the data is gone.  It seems to do this if it loosens up or is not seated properly or if you  pull the card out  while the phone is on.  I had one mode version l that it would not even see the card . I learned to not have the SIM in  or have it in slot 2 (one global version sent)  and then it would find the card and then it seemed to work after that without having to do that again.The curved ends will make it VERY HARD to use anything labeled as FULL SCREEN protection. If you do not like the plastic protectors , tempered glass, as I have been told, will lift .  I did not realize it had a curved edge when purchasing but now am still searching for the best solution to protect the screen.  It would seem the screen glass is easily scratched as I have tried  over 5 of these and  most of them l looked good at first but twisting the phone i the light to find some scratching.Camera lens is very fragile, something you might know  if you do not research . If you are fortunate to get one that still has the screen plastic over the  glass, LEAVE IT ON.  One video test on line shows a guy scratchching it with a blade and shortly after just shatters on its own.  Luckily this was such a common problem , there are after market repair kits for the glass. But still, something to note as it is a big bump. which may force you to get a thicker case.Cases are also hard to get. That is, the selection is dwindling as the model is no longer made.Finger print has been responsive and not picky. I like I can add several fingers.I do not like the LG keyboard but you can download your favorite and have that be the default.Battery life is OK.  Better than my last phone but it all come down to use. But then the one benefit of this phone, if you do not use an OtterBox, is to be able to quickly pop the back off and  swap.  As just a phone, and some light video watching or  music, I get about 2 days of battery life.  But I can also go from 100 to 50% in just a few hours if I am watching allot of content straight.I wanted a factory unlocked phone that works in the USA and also wanted a removable battery and the LG V20 is one of last phones that offered this. Its specs are very close to some of the flagship phones of 2018. So when I saw that they were selling the US Version/warranty  and listed US996 and had some ""Used Liked New""  I figured it would be worth  a try.  Amazon states Used like new items are in PERFECT condition but the packaging will be damaged.  So PERFECT and Like New are their words not mine. However what I got was , as times far from it.And to read that the  listing of NEW on the main page is not even honoring the model or condition is a bit concerningPlease note there are SEVERAL versions of the LGV20. They have their submodels and it effects if you will get updated.H910 is ATT, LS997 Sprint, H915 Canada, US996 has two versions, US Cell and the one I wanted US996 US unlocked.Then there are the Global sub models.  Like F800 is Korea, H990N is HK, H990 DS which as several  versions tied to the country or region.All the phones  came with Android 7 but all but two have not updated to Oreo 8.  Now that Pie 9 is out, LG states  LGV20 will receive it next year.  However While most of the models have recieved Oreo  in October the one with software from Mid East Africa ""AME"" still has not gotten the update .So if they are sending out ""global\' phones you may stuck with Android 7 and old security patch from January 18Rooting is a very complex process on this phone.So if they sending you  global version you may have issues upgrading and in the US you might have issues getting updates with a branded phone. And if you get a branded phone you will have  bloatware and annoying popups  you cant always remove . Sure you can hide but you cant not remove.I ordered 7 like new phones and feel Amazon is just pulling from bins  of mixed stock seeing what will get sent back.  Either that or they have a very loose definition of what is ""perfect condition""  . Or they are paying refurbish sellers to do this for them under their name.I have used AW before and never had such a mixed bag of dishonesty.First phone was a Dual Sim  H990 DS.  I did not know at the time there were several versions of the H990 DS so not sure but it might have been Taiwan or more likely theAME version This is far from the US WARRANTY version promised.  And there  was very light scratches you could see only when twisting in light. The accessories were not original but US version.Next was a US996 it was the only one but had light scratches to the glass and the screen appeared brighter but maybe was just more blue.I had it laid out next to all the screens and this one stood out as different while the others matched closely.  Was that screen replaced?  So I wanted to see if I could get another US996.They sent a LS997 Sprint with dead, aftermarket battery and obviously used heavy.  How dare they send me a crap phone at the same price, same category!They sent another 990 DS (AME) with damage to the back camera lens glass. Another ATT with very light glass scratches.  Any damage to the glass no matter how fine, is not ""perfect"" I feel the inspectors are not looking for issues just what jumps out . Yes if I just took out the phone in the right light all but a couple looked clean.  One had a visible scratch on  the  glass that anyone cold see and feel. Again, you damage this type of glass and you have a weak point when you do drop it.The last two they sent was a  pieced together  phone.  The Back was black on a titian Grey phone.  Now seeing several of these and having two other ATT phones, I  am not sure why it was black unless it came from a black phone  But as far as I know, they did not sell a black LGv20.  There was more crude on the seems and the back and bottom did not line up.  The  phone was obviously dropped or worked on  . The 2018 battery was zero charge  and the box stated BO headphones but there was a generic white with LG logo on the toggle but not sure if it is genuine.  And this phone  was not updating to Oreo 8 like the other ATT branded  model I still am holding onto.The last phone was another 990DS (AME) but was finally ""Like New""  The only draw back so far is it still is the model that has not updated to Android  8.  At least no bloat ware.It is real shady as if these were open box or returns  they should have original content.Some had a standard charger, one had the Euro charger, some came with the fast charger. Most had fall 2017 batteries and two had first quarter 2018 batteries.  Are those  genuine?I suspect this is some deal AW has with one of these resellers as  there is no way some of these should have ever been sent to me as ""Like New""  Most could be ""Very Good"" but some were Fair or Good.What angers me is that they charged me the same if not more with each purchase.  The price started  around $240 then $250 then $260 and then back down to $230 range.  OVer each week they would play with the price for the same condition and wold not price match. They did offer a credit but it has been very hard to find  items I want that amazon actually sells to be able to use it.  The rep did state  he has heard other customers concerned over the listing stating US but getting international phones.My guess is they are just gambling and seeing what they can send out and let the customer decide.  The fact I got  a couple with obviously poor condition, tells me things are not above board. I probably could have paid less and got some of these phones .It was disappointing that I get only 1 US996 out 7  and shame it had the scratch and screen color difference.At this point I risk them sending me the phones I already returned so guess the game is over.  It is a shame they are not sending what was advertised.', 'This phone is absolutely amazing. I came from the LG V10, and I always loved that phone. I was waiting forever to upgrade to this phone. Finally received it on Nov 11th!This phone is very sleek and beautiful. I rarely care about that, but it really is a nice looking phone.Having a removable battery is in my top 3 needed things. It is the only thing that I sometimes budge on when buying a phone, but I hate to, it is so handy to be able to just swap batteries and in less than 30 seconds have another whole full charge. The new Battery Cover release button is awesome and I love the new metal battery cover. I purchased a LG Genuine extra battery and charger kit on eBay, shipped from Korea. Well worth it. I also love the USB Type C plug, fiddling in the dark is no longer a problem! The Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 is very fast and convenient as well. My Anker PowerCore+ 10000mah Portable Battery Charger with Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 comes in handy when I\'m not wanting to completely drain my battery. So between that and my second battery. I am set for a long time of use.This phone is snappy, not only does Android 7.0 Nougat make it better, but I am very happy with it\'s performance. My only wish was that it would have had 5GB or 6GB of memory instead of 4GB like the V10 had. It\'s always nice to have a slight upgrade.The second screen is by far in the top 3 coolest features of the phone. Always having the time and date available while the main screen is off is sweet. I also use the flashlight using the second screen while the main screen off a lot. You can control your music that way too. Saves battery and time. While the screen is on I have some contact shortcuts on it, and I love being able to answer and hang up a call from it while I\'m in other apps. The main screen is also very high quality, loving the 5.7"" Quad HD IPS.I love the new fingerprint sensor and being able to unlock the phone with my fingerprint without having to press the power button. The V10, I could unlock with fingerprint, but had to press the power button first. I use fingerprint to unlock and get into secure apps very very frequently. Love this feature.One thing I\'m not sold on yet is the movement of the volume up and down buttons. I really did like having them on the back of the phone. Made one handed use even easier. I\'ve been having some issues/getting used to the new location. Not even close to being a disappointment though.Having an unlocked non-carrier version is the best thing ever. No carrier bloatware, and no carrier bootup screen. It\'s wonderful, and I love that I can use it on almost any carrier in the US.I\'m excited to use the camera more, the V10 camera was outstanding, and I can only imagine how much better this one will be. Being able to save photos to the MicroSD is awesome too. If the phone ever crashes I have all my photos on the MicroSD and can remove it. I also upload my photos to Dropbox, and using Google Photos with their unlimited free photo storage.LG Backup is an amazing app, it really is. Between that app and what Google backs up, settings etc. Transferring phones was a breeze. I went from my V10 to my V20, in less than an hour and a half . Minus a few apps that had to be relogged in, or permissions having to be regiven. I highly recommend LG Backup to anyone.Capture+ is very useful to me, to be able to quickly clip any part of my screen to share, instead of having to do a full screenshot. Nice feature of the QuickMemo+ app, otherwise, for notes I usually use notePad by niceSprite.LG allows so many OS customization\'s that most manufacturers don\'t. I love the option to change the order and color of the soft touch buttons. I also noticed the addition of Phone Themes! This is awesome, I changed mine from the normal white to the Black High Contrast, and really like it. I also like that I can change and organize my status bar shortcuts. See photos. As you can notice, I use Nova Launcher, so I can\'t comment on the new LG launcher without an app drawer. But I think I did notice that LG has an option to download their old Home Screen and Launcher App.I love having the Hi-Fi Quad DAC output through my treasured Headphone port (Sorry iPhone 7 users). I use Bluetooth in my car, I have a bluetooth beanie, a JBL Charge, and a JBL Micro Wireless, but I still use the headphone port while mowing the yard and whenever else I need to. I\'ve also used the headphone port to plug in an external microphone using an adapter. So no Apple, it\'s not outdated and I still want it. I\'m also excited to try the HD Audio Recorder that allows recording over a separate track.Finally getting to Android Nougat, the best new feature in my opinion is direct reply notifications. This allows you to respond to emails, sms, instant messages, etc right from the notification tray. Very handy.I probably missed something, I will add more if I think of it. But I would recommend this phone to anyone looking to upgrade to a new phone. It\'s one killer device.', 'I wanted this phone when it first launched. Good thing I waited for the price drop.I heard horrible things about the LG G4, G5 and V10. I owned a G3 and that was a solid phone.I have T-Mobile. LTE and VoLTE work great!What really attracted me to this phone was the built in DAC. My HI-Fi headphones sound great, but there\'s a catch. Read on.Pros:* Good battery life. Probably better or on par with my old Nexus 6P.* Quick Charging 3.0 (must use certified quick charge 3.0 charger to reap benefits)* USB-C* Removable back which you can access battery, SD card, and nano SIM card* 2 Camera lens (Wide and Standard)* Camera is top notch. It does struggle a little in low light, but all cell phone cameras do* Video recording is great. It switches from the normal lens to the wide angle lens seamlessly during recordings* The Hi-Fi DAC, but there\'s a big CON for this* I like the 2nd screen on the top. I leave it on all the time. It doesn\'t seem to drain the battery at all* Fast finger print scanner* NFC & Bluetooth works great on this phone, unlike my Nexus 6P which had connection issues with both* Kinda customizable with LG\'s theme and font shop. Wish there was an icon pack or something* Something that the Nexus 6P was missing, but this one has was that you can set different volume levels for your ringer and notifications* Still has IR blaster like their last phones* Not a lot of gimmicky features like Samsung phones....there were a few that I disabled, like the volume rocker shortcuts and answer when move to phone up to your ear. I love the ""knock"" (double tab) feature. This should be standard on all phones.Cons:* Although it comes with a high powered DAC, It\'s useless without a good Equalizer. I was really disappointed when I found out it didn\'t have a system wide EQ. I didn\'t use the LG Music app, which seems to be the only way to control the EQ. But I fixed it with a $2 app called Equalizer FX. I was hoping the phone would support 7 band EQ, but like most phones it only does 5 band. My old One+ 1 had 7 band.* The supplied charger is not Quick Charge 3.0...WTF.....I was wondering why the phone charged so slow. I plugged in into my QC 3.0 charger and BAM!!!.....the phone chargers very quickly. You\'ll know because it displays a Quick Charging message and the battery icon has the Quick Charge ""circle-bolt"" logo* I replaced or disabled almost all LG apps, like their calendar, messaging, and email apps. Bloatware wasn\'t as bad as I thought, but it comes with Evernote, Instagram, and Facebook preloaded. Disabling and hiding them was pretty easy. I highly recommend replacing their Messaging app. I wish I can replace their dialer and contact apps too. I tried, but on incoming calls, the default LG is the one being used.* Big Con here: The speaker is weak ASF. It\'s unusable in my opinion. If you like to do a lot of speaker calls, this phone is not for you. I thought that since it came with a Hi-Fi DAC, the built-in speaker would be thumping. We need front facing speakers. Compared to Nexus 6P, the 6P is still way louder than this phone and the 6P\'s speakers aren\'t that loud either. If you want speakers, then you can\'t beat Axon 7* The LG UI isn\'t that good, but it\'s not that bad either. By default the app drawer is gone (by design), but LG gives you the option to bring it back too. I don\'t like their icons.* Does not have built-in visual voicemail. Bummer. Most high end phones include it these days. Now I gotta pay T-mobile $5 a month to use theirs, which I won\'t be using.* Slow patches. When I was on the 6P, I was getting monthly patches. This phone is still on December patch and it\'s almost April.Overall, I am happy with the phone and would highly recommend this phone if you don\'t mind the weak speaker. I switched over from my Nexus 6P which was a very good phone, but I wasn\'t getting consistent LTE speeds and bluetooth was dropping signal all the time. Camera wise, the are both pretty similar. I thought the 6P took better indoor pics.', ""I refuse to pay those ridiculous prices for iPhones and Samsung phones. This was well priced and from a trusted brand. The photos are decent, sometimes miscoloured. For example, blues will sometimes come out as green, but that may be because I never adjust the camera settings, I always leave it on manual. The battery life has diminished over time--I've now had the phone for 4 years. Still, after 4 years, I do not want to get rid of it. I think it's a great phone with a large screen. I'd buy an LG phone again."", 'First, let me say that I\'m an Android user and I came to the LG V20 from the ASUS Zenfone line of cellphones. If you\'re not familiar with that brand, they produce quality budget phones. So purchasing the V20 was a jump for me from using a $150 phone to a $500 phone. After days and hours of reading specs and watching YouTube reviews, I was confident and certain that this would everything I read about and more.Here\'s my list of favorites/not-so favorites about the V20 and then I\'ll write in some details.FAVORITES:+USB-C and Quick Charge (3.0)+”2nd Screen”+Split Screen+Great Video QualityNOT-SO FAVORITES:-Cell Phone Size Too Big-Apps, Camera not as responsive as expected(But, maybe this is an oS issue?)-Photo Quality Not GreatI like LG cellphones, I had experienced with one in the past that I really enjoyed.-The primary reason for purchase of the V20 was for the camera. I love taking photos of fun places I\'ve been, my dogs, fancy dinner, etc. I had spent a good amount of time looking at several reviews and sample photos. IMO the camera did not perform to my expectations.+Video quality is great! I was even able to take under water photos and videos in my water proof case. They came out great, not shakey at all and very fluid.-However, still photos in Auto setting often came out very contrasty, sunlight would very easily cause alot of wash-out, and low lighting produced so-so photos. As for manual settings, I did like the extensive options available, but it was difficult to quickly reproduce the ""real"" colors in comparison to other camera phones I\'ve used.-Another issue with the camera that really bothered me was a portion of the photo seemed to always have a blur. I checked the lens cover and did not find any defects, this was a brand new phone, so I\'m not sure what could have caused the fuzzy, blurry spots.+I loved the USB-C port and Quick charge function. The battery would charge up in no time so I was rarely left with a dead phone.+""2nd Screen"" made it super convenient to see notifications without turning on the main screen. It also was so nice to access favorite apps like Google Music so quickly or get quick notification that my Bluetooth device was linked up. ""2nd Screen"" was def one of my favorite features and more phones should have it.+Split Screen is also a cool feature to have to be able to access more than 1 app at the same time, although I rarely used it.-Unfortunately, I did find the phone to be too large for my smaller hands and my personal preference. Im beginning to develop a little carpal tunnel and the weight of this phone in one hand really did not feel so ergonomic. There was no discomfort, but I definitely did not want to get in the habit of single-handed use. Also, the size made it difficult for single-handed use of simple tasks like opening an app or a quick text message, as my thumb would only comfortably reach to the middle of the phone screen, much less to the top.', ""I dislike not having control over my devices. This is, to a degree, unavoidable with modern smartphones, but I object vigorously to the trend of perfectly-sealed plastic bricks designed with active contempt for the user instead of passive. I wanted to be able to plug in my headphones instead of wasting double the battery time on BlueTooth, and to remove my battery and replace it at will rather than needing to cut glue, unsolder the old one, solder in a new one, and hope my regluing sticks properly.I was pleasantly surprised by the rest of the features-it gets excellent reception, loads quickly, runs cool unless playing ambitious games, and with a new battery (sadly light on the ground these days) keeps a charge very well. Unfortunately, battery life becomes an issue after about a year.It develops burn-in hilariously quickly (on the order of ten minutes or so) but thankfully that burn-in disappears similarly quickly, and it's a phone, not a TV-how long are you leaving it on a single screen?The stock UI is very intuitive, and my sole complaints run thus: the stock apps want you to agree to a EULA before you can use them, and the keyboard won't let you delete words from Autocomplete.All things considered, well worth the money-but then I paid $80 for it. I would not pay $200, but it may be worth it to you to do so."", ""One of the best phones of 2016. Totally loved it!I was considering the Google Pixel, Xperia XZ and LG V20. They are probably the best phones I can get at the moment (sorry I'm not a fan of Samsung). I chose the V20 over the rest because:- IPS quad HD screen, super sharp and clear. I came from the Nexus 6P and I didn't like the screen. It's too yellowish and not sharp enough for me.- Hifi Quad Dac: enable it, use high quality earphones + flac music = Awesome!- OIS: I would say EIS of the Xperia XZ and Pixel may be better, but ois is still more useful in some cases.- Second screen: oh man, if you use the V20 for a while, switching to another phone with no 2nd screen is a pain. The 2nd screen is definitely not a gimmick.It's super useful.- Removable battery- SD card slot: the Pixel doesn't have this- Fingerprint scanner: in the back and always works no matter what variant you get (Hello Xperia Xz!!!)- Audio jack at the bottom: subjective though- A wide angle camera: some people may not like it but I found it useful at times- IR Blaster: yay!! Save lots of time with your TV, and time to troll people at Walmart xD- Customizable navigation bar: yes, I can change home and back button to any position. I can even add more buttons to it.- 3 Mics with hifi audio recording: a big bonus- Manual camera: time to play around!!!Those are pros of the V20. But no phone's perfect.- Autofocus in video recording is bad sometimes. This is a huge deal breaker for me.- Battery life is just okay: QC 3.0 solves it. But yeah, still a deal breaker.- The back: everyone admits the back is freaking ugly :(- Water resistant: of course noone will dump their phones into the water, but things happen.If you can ignore those cons, the V20 is one of the best phones you can get atm."", 'I bought this phone after T-mobile told me it was $750 plus tax for theirs. I misunderstood the term ""Unlocked"" as I assumed the phone would arrive unlocked. That is not the case. This is an unlockable model (US996). In order to unlock I had to create an LG account, agree to all sorts of disclaimers, download a flashable image to unlock it and flash the image using fastboot. Once unlocked, I was able to flash it with TWRP recovery and root the phone using the ""dirtycow"" exploit I found on XDA. I require root for Titanium backup as well as bloat removal, full iptables firewall, and other things. The loaded Android OS is excellent, no T-mobile or other carrier bloat! Woohoo. The only crapware seems to be Facebook and Evernote which I dealt with quickly. Since the phone is listed as ""New"" I was disturbed to find the original factory seal was broken when it arrived. I assume it was to remove the sim card or to apply the screen protector that came already installed on the phone. The phone appears to be new in every way, not a scratch or any signs of use, so I kept it. I am very glad I did, this phone is fast and has a beautiful screen. Added my 128gb Sandisk card, so now have 180gb of storage. I also added a 10,000mah ZeroLemon battery/case and Supthin screen protector. The IR sender works great, I used the included LG remote app to quickly add every TV, cable box, satellite receiver, Stereo and other remotes I have within a few minutes. Very happy with the setup now, I can watch movies on it for hours on end and not even start to run low in battery and its screen is perfect for remote access to PC\'s and servers as well. With the split screen mode I can chat and watch movies at the same time, awesome! I highly recommend this phone and have already ordered a 2nd one for a relative.', 'I received this phone 2 days ago and upon first impression, side by side with my current Blu Vivo 5, the color saturation was nothing to boast about. The pixels were much more well defined then my Vivo 5 but the colors did not ""pop"" out to me as a comparison. The main reason I began my search for yet, another phone, was due to the lack of battery life. I purchased my current phone over 1 year ago and unfortunately, replaceable batteries are becoming a real challenge. I reviewed this LG phone, LG that I have owned in years past, so I thought this would have been a great option. I decided to go through the device to see how it operates, there were a lot of short cuts and abilities to change settings to make it your own. The phone was 100% unlocked however, after a few inquires I realized that I needed a nano SIM card which, I do not have at this time; this is an easy fix though. What determined my choice to return the phone, ZERO ability to use Bluetooth. I called Amazon support, rebooted the phone and still no Bluetooth this, while right next to my Vivo 5 which picked up on all Bluetooth devices including the LG V20, how can that be?? Amazon gave me an immediate credit which by the way, was for the original price before the increased it to nearly $445.00 along, with an additional credit to make up the difference in cost. After much consideration, I decided to order the Huawei Mate 9 for which I will review once received. I just could not bring myself to going through another LG V20 to see if it would work properly, or not. Lastly, I was really dissatisfied with the ""washed out"" color effect of the phone itself. So much for wanting a phone with a replaceable battery!']"

Beautiful, fast, feature packed, and light.  Buying new on Amazon saved me over $150 from being under contract by big red.  But, had I been able to wait until Thanksgiving, Verizon had some super deep discounts on phones.  But, my beloved Galaxy S3 developed a problem in the power button (exactly 3 years old) so I had to get a new phone much sooner than I wanted.It's great having some of the new features in this phone, but, some of the new features need some refinement.- The AlwaysOn display is nice, but it needs to have WAY MORE customization ability, and it really NEEDS to let 3rd party apps use it.  The #1 reason that Samsung gives for this feature is to keep you from having to press the power button so often just to see time and notifications.  But I want to see the temperature outside too, so I have to turn the main display on anyway.- Notifications (sound, vibration, LED) have been changed so much, and the different Android forum boards are chock-full of complaints about the loss of certain notification features.  I don't mind needing to download a new app to get what I want, but my Galaxy S3 could do it without an extra app.- The camera is great.  It's 12Mp but with this new Double-Pixel technology.  It's suppose to really excel in low light conditions.  My small testing of this showed improvements in picture quality of low light in about half of the pictures I took.  The best improvement is in room lighting where it is dimmed mood lighting near you, and then the area in the distance also has some dimmed lighting.  The close area is represented well in the picture and so is the other area that has its own lighting.  Other pics that didn't do so well had only one source of dimmed lighting.But my favorite feature of the camera is its speed.  I often take pictures of groups of people and I take many rapid-fire shots at a time in the hopes that I will get one or two pics where everyone has the right expression and looking in the right direction.  My S3 was quite capable of this, and I'm glad to report that the S7 is even faster, and the shots I get are a lot cleaner (less of my own jitters).But I do have a gripe.  Switching from Photo mode to video mode is annoying.  First off, there isn't an icon that lets you switch from one mode to the next.  It's a Record button (red dot).  But, it starts recording instantly. You wouldn't think this to be a problem, except that the video aspect ratio and size of the target is different when switching from photo (4:3 12M) to video.  This causes you to have to change where you are standing and change the angle you were originally aiming when in photo mode.  You find yourself with several false-starts before actually videoing what you wanted.  Annoying.  Bring back the icon that lets me switch to video mode so that I can adjust my framing before I start recording.The double-press of the home button to launch the camera is cool, but it doesn't work as often as I'd like.  It seemed to work better before I had enabled and setup the fingerprint recognition.  My guess is that the two features are fighting each other.- Fingerprint recognition is cool.  I just wish it worked more reliably.  Too often it says I need to hold my thumb on it longer, or to wipe the screen.  I've set up all 4 fingerprint IDs, each having about 10 different print pictures, with my thumb from different holding angles, but it still has trouble from time to time.- I love Wireless and Fast Charging.  And I love the animation on the screen showing you where your charge is coming from.  When wireless charging, a cool white exploding ring comes from the middle of the screen (and then is gone). When charging from the usb port, that white exploding ring comes from the bottom of the screen (near the usb port).  I've had no problem with Fast Charging either. USB and Wireless both do great (even with the holster cover I use).- Battery life seems good so far.  I'm so worried about what the battery life will be in a couple of years.  Will I find myself searching rooms for a wall outlet to charge my phone like I see so many iPhone users doing.  I kept extra batteries with me for my GS3 when I knew I was going to be away from my chargers the full day.  When I'd get to 20% power, I'd put in a fresh battery.  Then when I got home, I could charge them all at the same time.  With a non-removable battery, I'm nervous of the future.  Fast Charging is nice, but I'm not always near a charger.  Will this battery start to lose its longevity in a year?"", 'I updated my review...if you are excited to buy this phone and have a habit of dropping them like me, then please read the updated section before you do...---original---If you are an android fan, then you will like this phone.  It\'s fast, it\'s functional and if you buy it on Amazon it\'s cheap!  If you are an IPhone fan, well that\'s your problem.  jk  The fingerprint scanner is highly improved over older versions, it just needs a half second with your finder on it, no sliding required.  The camera is excellent, great pictures in low light compared to just about all other digital cameras I have ever had.  It is nice and slim and looks great.---after much research and consternation---All Samsung screens have curved edges.  Even my last phone, the Note 4 has slight curves.  This makes screen protection a little difficult.  There are basically 3 types of legitimate screen protection mechanisms:  full coverage tempered glass with adhesive, partial coverage tempered glass with no adhesive, and full body cases.* The only way to get full coverage with the S7 is to use a screen protector like the kind they have developed for the edge which are often labelled 3D.  The ""3D"" screen protectors are well known to pop off easily, collect dust around the edges, leave the screen with decreased sensitivity, or crack when using a case.  I have been through a handful and can attest this is absolutely true.  There is no advertising such as ""QQQ glass works with case AAA or BBB"" or ""buy X, Y, or Z glass with our case"".  If these really worked with cases they would have advertised exactly how to do it or more often sold them together.  All the case/glass combos I tried resulted in cracked glass and all of the glass protectors actually contained ""CASE FRIENDLY"" in the name.* Another solution is a full body case.  Unfortunately none of the full body cases I have researched receive more than 3.5 out of 5 stars on customer reviews, with even the expensive Lifefproof FRE only receiving 3.5 stars with 1 in 5 users giving it only 1 star.* The only remaining option is to buy a screen protector which only covers the flat part of the screen and buy a case for the rest of the phone.  The issue now is that the sides of the screen are unprotected.  True story, I once dropped my Note 4 and yes, the tiny 3 mm unprotected section of glass came into contact with concrete and the entire screen shattered.  Beyond simple protection, the OCD crowd may develop ticks, twitches and spontaneous turrets as they try to swipe the popup menu from the side of the screen.  For my Note 4, I purchased a case with larger corners to increase protection as much as possible and popped a couple Vailum to manage my ticks (not really).I\'m sure there is a legitimate reason for the curved edges, I just wish Samsung would work with vendors to develop a best fit solution to the screen protection issue.  I DO recommend buying this product, but if you are rough on phones like me, make sure you are informed before you do.', 'EDIT #2: The second ""new"" phone was also not actually new, but better described as either ""like new"" or ""open box.""  Screen had some tiny scratches on it (not visible unless light hits it just right, the kind of scratches you get from having it in your pocket with your keys for example). So, while the phone is great, the experience of buying it here is not (unless you know ahead of time that you are getting a device that\'s not really new and you pay a price that matches this expectation).  Unfortunately, I cannot give an excellent rating to the phone and a low rating to the service, so I have to split the difference and call this three starts.  However, the phone itself is great and worth 5 stars.EDIT: Phone\'s going back. Won\'t keep a charge when sim card is inserted (fine without sim card in it). Having now googled ""samsung galaxy s7 unboxing"" (and hating myself for it), I now suspect that the phone that was sent to me was not new, but was a previously-opened return.  The packaging lacked any security strips holding the box closed and there was apparently a micro-usb to usb adapter that was supposed to be included that wasn\'t. I don\'t care about the adapter, but if this was fraudulently advertised as ""new"" when it was indeed not actually new, that\'s a problem.  Since I bought through prime, Amazon will, of course, take it back, but (a) how much would it suck if I had bought without prime and (b) who is going to compensate me for the 4-6 hours of setting this thing up and then trying to debug it to figure out what the issue was with the battery? That\'s right, no one.The thing is, the phone was good (once properly set up), so I don\'t want to change the star rating yet, but the experience (so far) deserves a negative star rating (I wish this were possible).  Trying again (with a different seller this time), still through prime.  If that one works out as this one, I will lower the rating, not to reflect the quality of the phone, but to reflect the quality of buying it here.ORIGINAL REVIEW: As someone who has been extremely leery of Samsung phones because of their TouchWiz overlay on top of plain Android, I must say that I was hesitant to buy this phone.  However, replacing the stock launcher with Nova, most of the stock apps (which cannot be removed, but can at least be made less visible by renaming them via Nova) with stock google apps (dialer, messaging, calendar, and google now instead of s voice being the main ones), changing the theme of the remaining touchwiz bits to a dark material theme, and some timely swearing has turned this phone into something that appears (at least for now, on day 1) to be better than anything else currently available (and very much unlike any Samsung phone I have previously used).The google pixel (aside from being $200 more expensive than this phone) is not waterproof, has no external memory capability, is bigger than this phone, but has a smaller screen, and has a lower screen resolution. It has the latest version of Android, which is nice, but ultimately, I prefer external storage, a better screen and a bigger battery.Every other android phone is either too big or is lacking the best specs, which is unfortunate.So, if you are looking for a 5"" screen in a phone that fits well in your hand and in your pocket, but are afraid that Samsung\'s customizations will drive you nuts -- fear not, all is fixable (without root), given a few hours\' of work.One deviation from stock that i decided to keep is that the ""back"" button is on the right, while the ""current apps"" button is on the left, this is backwards from the standard android setup and always annoyed me.  However, once I held the phone in my hand long enough, I realized that as a righty, having the back button, which I use much more often, nearer to the corner where my palm is makes it easier to reach.  So, I\'ll keep this deviation, since it\'s an improvement.', 'I was really worried about purchasing a ""used"" cell phone but I figured if something was wrong, I could always ask for a replacement. Didn\'t have to, thank goodness. The phone arrived exactly when it was supposed to and was packaged well. It did not come with any original box or printed material or charger but that was OK. There was a little dirt on the edges from being in a protective case but it all cleaned off nicely. No scratches or blemishes anywhere. The screen was NOT scratched in any way and all works very nicely. My old phone bit the dust and I didn\'t want to pay the exorbitant prices that Verizon charges for this phone. ($33/mo for 24 months) This phone was half the cost of Verizon. The only downside, it did not come with a Nano Sim card. No problem, you can go to Verizon and they\'ll install a new sim card and if you aren\'t changing plans, it won\'t cost a dime. Yippee! And I asked Verizon what size SSD card it would support. Would you believe 128gb.....wow.  I didn\'t buy one from Verizon (I\'ll get one from Amazon) but I did buy a new case which was overpriced but what the hey. All is good.', ""The Samsung Galaxy S7 is a decent smartphone. I bought this phone because I needed a working smartphone for a reasonable price and was not looking spend big money on a another phone. My main phone's screen does not work and is cracked really bad. My phone came well before the expect delivery date. The Samsung Galaxy S7 I got from New Sky Inc. did work as far basically functionally but the phone for some reason could not response to incoming calls from other phones. (IN OTHER WORDS) Is does not ring for incoming calls or shows that I missed any phone calls. Weird because the phone came as described in very good used condition. I went to 4 different Verizon stores where I live. They said is was the phone and I should return it to the seller or try to get another phone. It was not the service (Verizon) but a hardware issue on the Galaxy S7 I got. Bummer because needed to the phone to fully work for me."", ""The camera on my several year old S7 quit, so I ordered this to replace it. It looked brand new. Unfortunately, it came with Android 7, my old one had Android 8. It wouldn't update to 8.  The tech at Best Buy told me that it wasn't possible to upgrade the OS.  Android 7 is not compatible with some of the apps I use, most notably my banking app. So I had to return it."", 'smaller display', ""Love it more and more each day.  Note, it did contain a Verizon SIM, so it could be activated online. (The SIM is smaller than the one in my S5 so I could not move that SIM.) The day I got it Verizon's activation service wasn't working so I had to do the support agent chat thing, but they got it activated.  I was able to move the SIM from my wife's S3 to my old S5 and get her going in no time with my old phone.  No need to go to the Verizon store and wait hours in either case, which may be your concern buying it this way.Great battery life, fast to do everything, awesome camera.I only wish the screen was completely flat so I could put a glass protector on it.  Going with a plastic one, but am worried about breaking the screen, which, btw, doesn't show ANY finger prints.  How do they do that?"", ""A solid Samsung phone with a bit more life. I just upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S5 since I'm a bit reluctant to throw down nearly $1000 on phones the likes of the Google Pixel or Galaxy S10.The phone came new and wrapped up with all accessories and instructions. As an added bonus the seller sent me a new SIM card with nano SIM inside, but unfortunately it was unable to activate. A quick trip to the local Verizon store and I have it up and running.Battery life is not much improved and unless you leave the phone off with most features disabled, expect to get 10-12 hours of texting, Internet, and media before you're done.This phone is no longer cutting edge, but it gets the job done at a used phone price without the baggage of a small 60-90 day warranty."", 'Good phone, I like it and I buy again']"

I dropped it and damaged the LCD (note that the glass was completely intact).  I thought there was a purple smudge on the left side of the screen, but it turned out to be the beginning of the ""bleed out"" and by morning, the screen was completely covered and I was unable to use the phone because I couldn\'t see anything.  I did some research on line and found that the only remedy was to replace the screen, which could cost upward of $200.00.  Since I had purchased the phone earlier this year from Amazon new for roughly $350.00, I found that spending $200+ on a repair made no sense so I ordered a new phone from the same company I purchased my original from, Re-Cell.I had no issues with the original purchase.  It was brand new, factory sealed in a Samsung box with all original parts- charger, ear buds, USB cable.  When the new phone came on Wednesday (2 days after being ordered), it was brand new, factory sealed in a Samsung box with all original parts- charger, ear buds, USB cable.  When I activated the phone, most of my info transferred over through Google\'s backup, I would just have to figure out how to determine what was missing from my other phone and load it onto the new S7.While configuring the phone, I noticed that it wouldn\'t connect to WiFi.  Not only wouldn\'t it connect, it wasn\'t even recognizing available networks.  I looked the problem up on line, tried a few suggested remedies - none of which worked.  It was getting late, I was frustrated and figured I would send an email to the seller through Amazon and see what happens.  This was roughly 10:30 PM, Eastern Wednesday night.The next day, Thursday, I was at work and I had a response from the seller\'s rep named Eric.  He apologized, said the company would make it right and had already arranged for a replacement to be sent and a return label issued for the defective phone.  He indicated that the replacement phone would be sent out priority and I should have it in about 2 days.Well, sure enough, the phone arrived on Saturday as expected.  I transferred the info from the defective phone to the new new phone via Smart Switch and the phone works perfectly fine.  I couldn\'t be happier.I have to stress that it\'s not often enough that someone take the time to give a positive review, but in this case, I felt it necessary.  Re-Cell\'s response was immediate - less than 12 hours after sending my email to them, they responded and already had made arrangements to correct the problem.  That is simply OUTSTANDING!  That is how you provide great customer service - no arguing, no haggling, no nonsense.  Just ""we apologize, your replacement is coming"".  Period.  I would recommend to anyone looking to buy this product to purchase it from Re-Cell simply for the peace of mind that they know how to provide excellent customer service.', 'I purchased this to replace my Galaxy S6, which I loved, that finally died. The Verizon store representative recommended the S7 over the S6 just to get something slightly newer and it still has the home button which I wanted, and one of the best screens made IMO.I was a little apprehensive buying one on line not knowing in what condition the phone might be in. It\'s a bit of a risk, but at the price listed and option to return it, I decided to take the chance. Plus it was about the fastest way for me to get a replacement phone unless I wanted a new model, which are all huge now days. I like the size of the S6/S7 as it fits comfortably in my back pocket.Anyway, the phone did arrive a day early and it is about as close to ""Like New"" condition once could expect. The screen has zero starches, which was my main concern. There are some slight, and I mean very slight, scuff marks on the back, but it will be in a case so it does not matter. The only real issues is the battery does not seem to be holding a charge very well. I fully expected that would be the case. I mean it\'s a 4 year old used phone for gosh sake.  Anyone thinking the battery should be like new is, well...not thinking. A replacement battery kit is under $20 so for around $150 in total, including a new case, I have an almost  brand new phone. I could not be happier. I would not hesitate to recommend this seller if you are interested in a used phone.', 'Great phone overall and great service', ""The phone was okay but I couldn't hear incoming calls. Turned volume up all the way but not loud at all."", 'Disappointed by the quality. I expected better from Samsung and realized their warranty has A LOT TO DESIRE. Because of the fact that the charging cable broke and their response was ""TO GET ANOTHER CABLE..."" really? with less than a month old??The next day I received the phone, I dropped it causing a minimal crack to the lower part of the screen. The phone works and there\'s no damage to the touchscreen, I\'m afraid if it gets wet, water may slip in the ""crack"". SAMSUNG claims that will NOT repair damage that\'s not under warranty, but will not provide with a charging cable replacement either, nor they\'ll replace (even if you pay) to have the crystal replaced. They have no authorized service centers and they will not recommend anyone and, if it\'s not serviced by an authorized dealer, they\'ll void the warranty...So what they\'re saying is:Look! We messed up with the note, the refrigerators (and who knows what else)We\'ll take your money, get has much capital as we can and then, maybe later, MAY BE able to do something for you. On the meantime, keep on buying our products. And remember if you broke it, we won\'t fix it, but don\'t YOU DARE have fix by somebody else, because we\'ll void your ""warranty""Sadly I realized I made a mistake by purchasing this phone because I THOUGHT Samsung was a good and reliable company and it just proved me WRONG.I had my friends HTC one phone screen replaced. It was not just the crystal, it was the screen itself too. (It got run over by a real tractor, not home\'s,  lawnmower and HTC replaced it without a charge, YES!!! WITHOUT CHARGE.

I had bought a replacement refurb S7 phone from that giant retailer ""W"" but was disappointed to see the phone screen had thousands of tiny scratches, probably from car keys.  Sent it back.Then I saw this phone here on Amazon.  Not only was it selling at a bargain price, but the phone is in PERFECT like-new condition.  Don\'t know about the battery yet, but functionally and physically the phone looks brand new.  Thanks Amazon--', 'I returned this phone after 3 days. I was an early Android user (MyTouch) and switched to iPhone in 2012. iPhones have their own issues, especially with batteries, so I thought it would be fun to try out something totally new. I\'ve been hearing so much praise for the Samsungs so I got a gold S7. I will say that I loved the feel and look of it. That\'s all I loved though. Here are the worst things about it:1. The battery drained shockingly quick. At the end of the day I was at 15%. For a brand new phone that\'s really bad.2. The phone comes packed with bloatware that cannot be removed.3. The Android operating system is truly awful. There were so many weird quirks, bugs, and missing features. For example, there wasn\'t a restricted access mode so you can have your kids watch a video and not mess with the screen...but there\'s an app for one. Or the sound produced by the Samsung headphones is so bad I actually thought they were broken. They\'re not...but there\'s an app to ""fix"" that. Are you freaking kidding me?! Even seemingly little things caused a ton of inconvenience. My phone connected to my car\'s stereo via Bluetooth, but I was not able to use the car\'s controls. I had to actually pick up and unlock the phone to change a song. To Spotify it\'s probably just a little bug that they\'ll get around to fixing whenever, but to me it\'s a big deal. And I realized that if I kept this phone I\'d better settle in for many of these situations, because the truth is developers don\'t care about Android and its apps will always be given lowest priority. And I\'m not about to accept that when I paid for a ""top of the line"" phone. Is this what passes for normal to longtime Android users? Was that my fatal mistake, switching to this OS with too-high expectations, like having full Bluetooth functionality, or sending text messages without an app crash?4. The phone was always warm/hot. Even when I wasn\'t using it. I\'d pick it up and it\'d be suspiciously warm. Made me very nervous given Samsung\'s recent fire issues.So back this terrible phone went. It\'s too bad, I think the design is beautiful and I wanted it to work because Apple isn\'t super great either. But unless you\'re on a budget or a super advanced user ready to root your phone, iPhone it is.', 'I ordered this phone from the seller A1 Global Corp and am completely satisfied.A number of people who bought this phone from other sellers complained that it was not a ""NEW"" phonebut a reconditioned/refurbished phone.

I grew up in the rotary phone era so I\'m ""latest technology challenged"".The documents included were very basic and not very helpful. So I d/l the 174 page Samsung manual.Which got me started in setting up the phone and getting started in the right direction.After fully charging the phone I opened a Verizon account.What I should have expected was - this is a 2016 phone and does not have the latest Android version.So - there was 29 updates to get me current with the latest Android version for the Galaxy S7.Very time consuming but necessary.Overall I am extremely pleased with this purchase and especially the great customer service provided by this seller.A new phone that works great at the lowest price anywhere.', 'I got the product ""seller"" refurbished, distinction not mentioned in product details. It is in ok shape. A few of the screen scratches are larger than I wanted, but a glass screen protector helps cover most. I was really annoyed about the seller sending not only not a quick charger but nor even a samsung charger. So I had to go and spend more money on a quick charger. But I\'m glad I did because it charges way faster. The galaxy s7 itself is awesome. Wireless charging, fingerprint, tons of storage options... only thing I miss about my iPhone is imessage.']"

This phone looks and functions enough like my M8 to make the change seamless, but with enough upgrades to be exciting (rather than a drag) The Camera is much better, and the front speakers are a bit fuller than my old one. Data runs quickly, and it's clear there are improvements on the previous version in the way data access runs.I still can't use the HTC car app without having to manually create a shortcut and pull the app from the dark cave where the provider tends to keep putting it, in favor of their version of it, which in my opinion is not as easy to use while driving.The Dot view case on this one is nicer than the M8 because the back is clear so you can see the phone's glorious metallic color, but the seam where the front and back meet is a little flimsy (I did have to take a spot of crazy glue to it already, but I'm not reviewing that..), so we'll see. I do like the more protective design as my old phone did get a bit of corner wear where the HTC cover didn't fully protect each edge.All in all, I don't know that I'd have made the jump to this phone if not forced, as it is so significantly similar to what I am replacing, but I do feel that there are significant enough improvements that would warrant consideration of this phone over the previous model.Seller sent it super quick and I got it in less than 48 hours on a holiday weekend. SO grateful for that."", 'This is a short review of the buying and shipping experience, if u want a review of the phone itself there are plenty of well written reviews out there. When buying something I always look for reviews about the seller/packaging/receiving correct items.Pictures includedI ordered this phone from Blutekhttp://www.amazon.com/HTC-Factory-Unlocked-Cellphone-Silver/dp/B00V59AZAK/ref=sr_1_1?m=A3TBDBTCHAVT15&s=wireless&ie=UTF8&qid=1446685764&sr=1-1&keywords=htc+m9Blutek had no descriptions in the seller\'s list, but I read the seller feedback and it was positive so I went with them.What\'s in the box (see some pictures)>Earbuds with replacement buds>phone>guide>warranty guide>4 stickers with imei numbers incase u need to repair the phone.>A little ""key"" to open the SD and SIM card slots.>charger with usbWhen you start using the phone and wifi sign in with accounts and all that, you\'ll get 2 years of 100gb for google drive and unlimited storage with amazon cloud for a year.I received the phone in the usual amazon box package with the inflated bags.>The phone was brand new in an original HTC box.>Received an Australian version with an AU charger, but Amazon description says""European version -US adapter included."">Contacted seller to ask for a US charger.

It sucks out phone's recourses and never optimized, it can even cause internal errors (happened to my previous AT&T  smartphone).Good god after 4 minths I  don't regret at all. If I put this phone down and forget it for 8 hours battery will go down by 5 percent at most! If I heavily use it during the day it lasts for 10 hours (10 hours of frequent chatting on FB and browsing web).As a comaprison friend of mine got Verizon (carrier locked with bloat ware)  version of this phone and he has pretty bad battery life even in standby.So yes, it is abit much to spend at once, but not having to deal with bloat ware is worth it!Now to the fun part, recent several updates to camera actually did solve problems with low quality of shots that was mentioned on C-Net and in other reviews. Phone does indeed have that very good camera hardware, issue was with poor software. So now main disadvantage of the phone is resolved and you get it all, powerful hardware, beautiful design, always latest version of Android (since you don't have to wait for carrier).Oh and I dropped it twice already with a slim nearly nonexisting case, phone is in tact. I think that wide bezel on top and bottom protects the screen form coner hits that cause screen cracks most often.If you were wondering, no phone does not have physical button where HTC logo is, all that blacl bezel is not being used, I wish it was a home button though. On the bright side since all the buttons are software defined you can rearrange them any way you want.HTC Sense is beautiful and has great usability as it always was. Nothing like this beautiful signature HTC Sense watch widget.==============Pros:- Several camera app upgrades resolved low quality of photos issue- stylish- solid metal build- HTC Sense is well refined and beautiful- gorilla glass screen does not scratch and tough to crack- Uh Oh protection, HTC will replace your phone once no questions asked- no carrier bloat ware- very good standby battery life==============Cons:- Heavier than competitors (iPhone6 and SGS6)- Not waterproof- Battery is not easily replacable"", ""I really love this phone. I bought it to replace the Galaxy S4 due to a combination of cracked glass and hardware defects. It's got a good feel in my hand, and responds pretty snappy.As far as hardware, it has all the LTE bands of AT&T and T-Mobile in the US. I'm a TMo prepaid customer, and it was as simple as popping in my nano SIM and choosing TMo as the provider. It supports microSD cards up to 2 TB. The phone has 3 GB of RAM and the Snapdragon 810. I have yet to see any lag in the phone. I'm able to switch between a browser, pedometer, Pokemon, Google Maps and Antennapod with ease. It has a SuperLCD screen and Gorilla Glass 4.0. The open-box phone I bought had a scuffed corner, so I'd still recommend buying a protective case and screen protector. The only negatives I can really point to are that the battery isn't removable, and that it isn't compatible with Qi wireless charging (you can buy receivers that plug into the microUSB port, but I'm a bit wary of them).I also found that the HTC Fun Fit app drains very little battery (as opposed to S-Health, which chewed through my S4's battery and wasn't very accurate), which makes a good step and distance tracker. It also does not require Internet connectivity, for those who'd rather not broadcast their data to the world. The HTC sense keyboard gets a little annoying with its suggestions.As soon as I got the phone (Aug 2016), I was able to update to Marshmallow, and HTC has it on the roadmap for Nougat.Probably the deal sealer for me is that HTC's Uh-Oh protection doesn't necessarily void your warranty if you use a custom ROM. In fact, if you go to htcdev.com, HTC will help you unlock your bootloader so that you can load a custom ROM on to your phone. I switched from the stock ROM to Android Revolution HD, which is basically the default ROM minus bloat and plus ability to root. I rarely go below 90% battery unless I'm using my phone a lot during the day without getting to a charger. Even still, I haven't dropped below 50%, and with a QuickCharge 2.0+ charger, you can get back up to full in about an hour. Great work HTC! I'm definitely looking your direction whenever this phone gives up the ghost."", ""love the design and style of this phone. bought to upgrade from my galaxy s4. the theme design is fantastic too... I like that I can get themes designed by other people and apply it to the phone. speakers and sound software are also great.The only thing that knocked it down a star for me is the phones reception. Not sure if i got a lemon or not...but it's reception is regularly only 70-80% of what my galaxy 4 had. For those in a 4 bar area, this is probably not an issue...but where my house is at, i can barely scrape 2 bars from my galaxy. it worked with that...but with the M9 i can't even get or take calls.Im currently migration from AT&T to T-mobile, where at least if i can't get good cell reception in my house, I'll be able to use their Voip soluion (AT&T currently only allows iPhones for their VOIP). the fact that i had to switch carriers to use the phone would have dropped more then 1 star, but this is specifically a local issue with me. others may not get the same results.Although I must say, if this is not a lemon, having worse reception then a 4 year old worn out phone is unacceptable IMO. I gave it a pass only because I don't know if it's specific to me, or if it really just has worse reception. Just letting others know...it's not an issue if you get the phone on some kind of plan, but buying upright via Amazon it's buyer beware, so letting folks know.Other then that love the phone...only wish the Tmobile SIM would get here faster :)"", 'Have had this for a few days, and so far I like it!There are a ton of apps that you will never need on it tho, and you can\'t uninstall them - rather you have to go to app manager>running>""app name"" and disable it.I however do not like keyboard text predictions, and am very disappointed in HTC. First off, the keys are small and I have large fingers, so I hit \'j\' a lot rather than \'I\'. On my HTC One X, the keyboard was like, ""I gotcha brah!"" and fixed those mistakes - This one on the other hand will leave it and give me bad word predictions. It doesn\'t have a good spell check at all - I\'ve seen phones in the early 2000\'s with better text prediction/spell check software than this one. C\'mon HTC! You guys did great with the One X, why is the spell check/text prediction software on your best phone a P.O.S.??But there are several cool features: built in remote control, great audio, awesome selfie camera.Onto the camera, I believe that the selfie camera has a much better quality photo than the 20MP back camera. How? Idk, but it just is. All the photo\'s Ive taken with the selfie camera are much sharper and cleaner.Overall, I still like the phone but would like to see some improvements in the software.', ""I wish I read reviews here before I bought this phone.. I didn't have time and I needed phone urgently ... Before this one I was using (for 3 years) previous HTC model: HTC one mini 2. Really great phone! Obviously something happened with HTC in general..or my phone wasn't a real HTC (I know it sounds crazy but...) ..I can't explain this other way.. I don't even know how did I survive a year with this garbage of phone, honestly..And it was bad exeriance from the very first day.. I was thinking to return it, but I was very busy, didn't have time to deal with that..I was hoping once I update Android, it would be better... so I made a big mistake in the start:(((( ..and I kept this phone...I don't know where to start, honestly:- Rright lower corner of display was kind of loose (from the Day 1) .. when you're typing or pressing that part of the screen you can feel and even hear how the display is moving (?!)..- I couldn't update android, (I managed only once, but only for some ancient version) ..- The keyboard was super slow (I.E. it needed like 12 seconds to change language on keayboard, or change from letters to signs keyboard)..- Battery! I was using phone a lot, but after like 4 months I had to replace the battery (It was hard to find a technician willing to do that, because inside this model everything is so complicated, disorganized..inside parts are glued..it's a waste of time for technician..several people told me that) ..- Also, after just 2 months of using it, I had some weird dots on photos..very visible when you zoom  picture, I thought it was sand or dirt, but mobile phone techinicians told me that there's some kind of pigmentation inside the lens (?!) ..so nothing could be cleaned or removed..  :((( so, all photos from my travels are basically damaged..- A lot of times after battery died, all my music playlists were completely disappearing, so I had to make a new ones..again and again.. so painful experiance...There were some other things too..but I don't wanna waste my time anymore, even discussing this phone.. I know this is pretty old model, which probably nobody wants to buy now, but I just had to share my horrible experience..Never back to HTC.."", 'It said all accessories, but the earphones were missing. Seller was Markshecider.Phone itself is in excellent condition.', ""Let me start by saying my last two phone have been iPhones so to switch to droid was a jump but at the same time you get more for your money with HTC or droid in general then you would with apple, OK so I was attracted to this phone one Because it's HTC and and two the price what you get for it one it's faster then my wife's iPhone S6 two I can add more storage to it with a micro SD card three the speakers are the most amazing speakers I have ever heard on a phone it's so amazing to watch a video and hear the sound facing you not bouncing off the walls to your ears the only draw back to this is the battery life if I could get 2 or 3 more solid hours of use out of it per day this phone would be unstopable! And the 20MP camera is not as bad as the reviews make it out to be but u need a steady hand with it no question ."", ""I've had this phone for a month already, so this is my opinion after all the initial excitement of a new phone... I've had HTCs for a while, starting with the Desire, One S, One X, One Mini and now this. I think it is super. I hesitated between this and the Nexus 5X which just came out. The Nexus is theoretically cheaper, but after you upgrade it to 32 Gb (which the One M9 has) its price was about the same. The One M9 has SD card slot, which I filled in with a 64 Gb card, expanding my storage to 96 Gb. The sound on its front stereo speakers is superb and I've enjoyed watching movies on it due to this. The main (back) camera is probably my only negative (which is strange because the One X had the best camera of its time); even though this has 14 Mpixels, the quality of the images is not that great - larger pixels would have been better than more pixels. On the other hand, the 5Mpixel front-facing camera is excellent and the image quality for video calls is really excellent. Unlike other people, I don't find this phone getting too hot at all and it charges very quickly.Overall I have to give this phone 5*.""]"

This is by far the best phone I have ever had. My last 5 phones were: Sony Xperia Z1, Sony Xperia Z, LG Optimus G, HTC One S, iPhone 4.Design:I love the way this phone was built, it\'s light and it looks great. It\'s plastic but it feels like metal. The buttons on the back are easily reachable (altough I rarely use them). I don\'t like the 3.5 mm jack at the bottom of the phone.Screen:The Screen is superb. QHD is the best you can get today, it\'s super responsive and it looks amazing indoors. Outdoors is another story, you have to put the brightness control at 100% to be able to see under direct sun light. All in all this screen will wow everybody.Camera:Excellent camera, the results are amazing, you can shoot 16:9 pictures at 10 mpx and 13 mpx pictures 4:3. The dual tone flash really helps when it\'s dark. Images are crisp and clear. You can also record 4K, Full HD, HD and 120 fps videos at 720p. Videos are also great. The front facing camera is ok, nothing too spectacular but is not bad either. I just wish LG would have given the user some more options and manual controls.Battery:Battery life is good. I can use my phone for 15+ hours in a normal day. If your screen is on for too long the battery will suffer a drastic drop. In general it is good, not great but good.Performance:Great performance, you can run any game or app smoothly, you get 40.000+ in Antutu with lollipop.Software:This is not going to be a popular opinion but... I really like what LG did with Android here, I feel Android Vanilla is very limited, I really don\'t enjoy the ""Vanilla Android"" experience. The interface is pretty, the icons are nice, the transitions are awesome. You have a lot to choose from, but that\'s what Android is about,.. choices.Signal and Calls:Phone calls sound great, signal is always good. I have one BIG problem and it is the fact that I can\'t get 4G (LTE) from the phone without getting into the LG hidden Menu (3845#*855#) the option is simply not there. If i get into the hidden menu, go to LTE only and select the band manually I get 4G but if I reboot the phone i have to do it all over again.All in all this phone is amazing, Just Buy it, at this price you can\'t go wrong. Oh!!! Something else, the battery is removable and it takes Micro SD cards up to 128 GB', '1. Really affordable. You get a flagship experience for just $300-4002. Specs: Quad HD screen is gorgeous ! Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 is good enough.3. Design is good. The phone feels really solid even though it is still plastic. The back is not glossy. At first, I thought the phone was made from metal but it is not. The bezel around the screen is really small.4. Good battery life. Mine lasts with 7-8 hours of screen on time.5. Average camera: This phone has decent camera. I am using the Galaxy S6. And compare to the S6, LG G4 has just decent camera.6. OS: I have Android Lollipop update right out of the box (with an OTA update)I strongly recommend this phone to anyone who wants a flagship phone at decent price.', 'So, we bought this phone as ""NEW"" from this seller for my our Daughter for Christmas in 2016.

It is a different motherboard packaged in a d855 shell. It's modified to show that it's a d855 in the settings but the one I received was an ls990 (Sprint). These aren't just refurbished, they have been refurbished (bad chips fixed with a shoddy reflow of the board) but they are also modified to appear to be something they are not. Do not purchase. DO NOT PURCHASE"", 'I thought this would work with my carrier and was sad to find out it did not work with my t-mobile 4G.', 'I live in Mongolia and just got my phone, Absolutely fantastic, Very lightweight and performance is top notch. Snapdragon 801 and 3GB ram, LG specific hard drive(memory) is like SSD. MicroSD just above the MicroSim card slot. Buy the phone.

The bright color screen of the m130 well worth the extra price. As I compared it against much more expensive models in the stores (Clie for example) the m130 has the most readable screen. The lower resolution compared to the top-end Clie models doesn't hurt much and you save almost 50%. The small screen size doesn't bother me, I suppose because I was used to it from my previous m100.I considered the Pocket PC devices too but they are triple the price and more aimed at the enterprise. Palm has a wealth of useful software for consumers, much of it free. One of my favorites is AvantGo. Read the news etc. while waiting in line or otherwise bored.I am having trouble installing the free MGI picture viewer software into my Windows XP computer but otherwise the applications work fine.I am impressed with the rechargeable battery. Having been used to the two AAA's lasting a month on the grey models, I was worried. But it recharges quickly and easily.It comes with the world's ugliest PDA coverplate, though. No doubt they are trying to irritate you into buying a replacement cover."", 'The Palm m130 is the best pocket computer of its time. And still is -- modern smartphones seem to appeal strictly to the new user, and it appears that this aspect is taken overboard. By contrast, the m130 balanced the hardware-to-software love that only Apple has matched with their products, and in all seriousness, the Palm seems to be the only computer that feels like it\'s not a computer, but an extension. It almost feels lovable. In a sense, the click-wheel iPods felt the same. The flip-top cover with the clock window, the durable case, interchangeable plates, and the streamlined feel are memorable. The universal connector makes it easy to charge, and installing new apps is really easy. Simply purchase what I\'d like to label a ""mini-floppy"" or SD card, and put it into a reader. Download apps and put them in the Palm\\Launcher folder. Deleting apps and copying them feels fluid on here, and really, while the Palm was simply viewed as ""an organizer"" with the ""real PCs"" being the pocket PCs, the Palm m130 simply works. It does allow making and editing Word and Excel files, for instance, and all the popular features--but it is a full computer. It can run a miniature variant of DOS, iSpin (which emulates a Windows-like desktop right on it), several games, a two-pane file manager, C compiler, and a lot more. Without joking, downloading AudioDriver 1.2 allows it to play simple songs through the built-in system piezo. The old Symbian phones are the only ones that really matched Palm, and while now it is the next generation of handheld and mobile computers that are prevailing, the Palm still remains a missed and great little palmtop....', 'I have been using a Palm III for about 5 years and finally maxed out its memory. So I decided to upgrade to a newer model that has an expansion slot and at least 8 MB. After trying out several models I narrowed down my search to the m130 and m500 from Palm. I bought the m130 because of two reasons; it felt much more comfortable to hold than the slimmer m500, and the color display makes it much easier for me to read than the monochrome screen. I have had it about 1 week and I\'m hooked. I love using it, the color screen makes such a difference. It is so much easier to read text against the white background. I also find the Grafitti recognition to be more accurate than the Palm III and I like the feel of the screen when writing. I also like the ability to write ""notes"" directly on the screen. All in all a great device for a reasonable price (I bought it here at Amazon). I would highly recommend the m130 - go for it!', ""I've never owned a PDA before but the Palm m130 is a very nice unit and works well. I use it everyday and think it's a wonderful tool to have around. One thing I really like is the ability to sync my MS Money 2003 (on my computer) with the m130 at a touch of a button...nice! So while on the road I can enter items purchased in the PDA and sync it with my computer when I get home.(update) I didn't realize if your battery was dead for any length of time you'd lose all of your downloaded programs. I had purchased several programs for my PDA on the Internet, downloaded them, used them for some time, but after my Palm sat around the house for a few months without use...poof! they're gone. So keep it charged or say goodbye to your after market software!"", 'I am new to handhelds and I originally was going to buy the lower priced Zire.  However, there were several programs I wanted to add that redquired more memory.  You cannot update the Zire.I opted for the M130 and was not disappointed.  It is user friendly and great for a novice.  The small screen is not really bothersome since you can easily input using your computer and then synch.I noticed some reviewers said it was difficult to use the stylus on the screen.  I have not found this to be a problem at all as it seems very accurate.My only complaint is having to switch from alpha mode to numeric when inputting.  I would prefer to have the screen contain both.', ""I got this from a merchant seller who never sent me the original installation CD, so I had to get everything from the Palm website.  It worked great every time no problems at all, until one day randomly when I was playing Chess, the thing suddenly went on the fritz, and I had to reset it, loosing all my information in the process.  Thank God for the Palm desktop that restored everything when I sync-ed it.  Its not like PocketPC.  If your a Mac person, go with the Palm OS, if your a windows person... do PocketPC.  I wish i'd known the difference when I bought mine."", 'I got this back in 2002, it was one of the first color palms. I did not have a cell phone back in the day, so this was useful for games, organizer, etc... The batter was not replaceable on it.It was pretty cool, I used to put PDF books on it, and I had Sim City, and it would sync web content when I put it into a cradle. Also had pocket office, and a fold out keyboard. Wish my Nokia N75 had that.', 'I loved my first m130 which lasted about a year. When the case I cracked I bought two more for my husband and me. Both of ours cracked after about a year plus the OS is not compatible with XP for syncronizing. Plus I had a lot of problems with getting a recharger that would work or last long for the M130. I have since bought the Zire 22 which I have had for more than 2 years and the case is still intact.', 'Old school to epic levels, it worked fine for a while but if the battery dies, you loose everything... I even lost what I had saved on my SD card for some reason.  Mine arrived with a broken case, right near the power button at the top.  I had to super glue this to keep it from falling off (the cover that is) which means that I cannot swap the covers anymore.', ""Well, maybe not, but close. There really isn't much to be said about Palm products that hasn't been over and over. Suffice it to say that, having graduated to the m130 after my poor, overworked m125 went belly-up, I'm delighted with its features and performance.I went for the 125 initially because I liked the idea of using regular batteries. However, so far the 130's onboard rechargeable is behaving beautifully. I also like that the adapter socket has been moved to the cradle rather than being on the same end as the USB plug as it was previously.I use my Palm mainly for reading--submissions to my publishing company and ebooks sent to me for review. However, I find I'm using the other functions more and more, and Palm OS has one of the nicer interfaces I've used.Great price, and just what I need--who could ask for more?""]"

I had an Android phone from Trac Fone. I don't want an expensive iPhone plan but wanted a better phone. When I saw this iPhone made for Trac Fone, I was hopeful. Bought this mainly to have a better camera and connectivity to my Apple lap top. The price is better then any other iPhone and works with Trac Fone inexpensive plans. With both phones charged and ready I tried to activate this phone on the Trac Fone web site. No go. The message I got was that it didn't recognize the Serial Number that came with the phone. Customer support transferred me 3 times and then I got cut off. I looked up on you tube how to transfer from Android to iPhone. It worked until the last step. Gave me an error message many times. Tried rebooting the phones and starting again. Same message. I was going to return this phone but thought I'd see if the SIM card in my Android would fit in the iPhone. IT DID!! I hadn't expected that. Who knew? I've been able to get the phone up and working with all my contacts, downloaded all my pictures from my Apple computer, etc.. Although Trac Fone doesn't know what kind of phone I have ... I don't think it will matter. The phone has TFW initials (Trac Fone Wireless) on the top of the phone so it is recognizing that this is a Trac Fone Phone. I have received calls and texts with no trouble and connected to all my accounts. My work APP is working too. Just saying. Hope it helps."", 'Over the years, I\'ve bought numerous Tracfones.  A couple for myself, and several for relatives, coworkers, and friends as second phones for them.  Until now all were Androids and I never had an issue activating them online and getting them up and running for those I got them for... until now.  So I got this iPhone SE for myself since my other one is old, and need this for work purposes.  It came with the phone, and a packet from Tracfone with a physical sim card, and activation numbers.  Seems straightforward.  I go in to activate the phone and it keeps telling me my physical sim (inserted) was an ""electronic sim"" and would not continue.  Tried otherwise, and it still froze up - so I had to call Tracfone ""customer service""...Rep 1 tells me from their non-U.S. call center that I had to ""buy a new number as well as a plan"".  No - you do not have to buy a new number.  He kept asking me for my credit card.  I hung up and called back.  Rep 2 says the physical sim I was sent doesn\'t show up as anything other than an e-sim, and he gets confused, so transfers me to an upper level tech person.  Rep 3 is almost as confused and proceeds to tell me that the sim number that came with this ""can\'t be used on Tracfone, but instead needs to be used on Straight Talk Wireless"" (also owned now by Verizon alone with Trac, and plans cost more there).  After some discussion about no, I was not going to do that, somehow he then figures out how to activate this on a Tracfone plan (less money).  I won\'t go into much more as it would be a small novel, but the entire process took no less than two hours to get this thing up and running.In the end, I had to put it on a temporary plan just to get this done and will switch to what I wanted later, hoping the phone and plan continues to work properly along the way.  But I have never, ever, experienced such a ""cluster"" with Tracfone, and after this, probably will not be recommending them to anyone again.  Too many other options.  Again - this PHONE is a nice little iPhone for those who just want the most basic iPhone - nothing wrong with that.  But I would suggest buying it unlocked if you get the SE, so you can use it on a service OTHER than Tracfone.', 'I watched a lot of videos on this and the iPhone 13 mini. It’s funny that most of them knock certain elements of the phone. The camera is fantastic. It charges very fast. Has plenty of storage. The big plus for me is the size. It’s just right for me.', 'This was easy to set up, I was a beginner Iphoner and was afraid I could not undertand and use the phone.  I love it! Now I wish I would had purchased one sooner.', 'Fortunately, the second phone I got worked flawlessly, and despite the first one being a total brick, Amazon was amazing about doing a replacement, despite being totally out of stock only took a few days Also, this is a great phone!!!!!!! way better than second GEN', 'This is Tracfone’s only latest phone. Works great. Comes brand new. Highly recommended. Does not have all features like the iPhone 14. But that’s ok. You save around half the amount of money on this device itself. Tracfone really needs to release the latest IPhone and android devices in order to grab more customers. That’s my opinion.', 'Truly a marvelous I-phone! Well worth the money! Youll love it!', 'I tried to activate this phone on the TracFone website three times with no success. I also tried to activate it with one of TracFones agents live chatting twice with no success. Save your money and buy something else.']"

Reception is as good as any phone in the household, and there\'s not a single feature that I miss. I know my  other ($650) phone must be superior, but I haven\'t figured out how.I\'m using the phone with an AT&T SIM in slot 1, and a Telcel SIM (from Mexico) in slot two. Occasionally, I\'ll use a T-Mobile SIM in slot two, which also works well. The phone has two ""real"" SIMs, rather than eSIMs, which gives you added carrier flexibility.The phone is 4G VoLTE, dual standby, with both SIMs always active.Samsung is promising two Android OS upgrades, which is great if they deliver. The phone comes with Android 11, the latest at the time of purchase (9/21).Be advised that while the Samsung A32 is on AT&T\'s list for working after their 3G shutdown (February 2022), this particular model number is NOT on AT&T\'s list at this time. The phone\'s technology is compatible, but AT&T is trying to force the unblocked phones off their system.I think they\'re bluffing, and that after all the pressure (sales calls, etc), this phone will work on AT&T. But in case I\'m wrong, I\'ve taken the phone to T-Mobile, who\'s confirmed that it will work on their system after 3G shutdown.']"

This phone just got Android 12 and One UI 4.0. Is very fast and the screen and camera are gorgeous. Pro features on camera can really improve photos.A couple quirks/things I dislike about this phone:It is ""only"" 256 BG storage. For whatever reason, 512 GB Note 20 Ultras are hard to find. I am replacing a Note 9 512 GB phone and I can already feel the constraints. I almost wish I waited for the 512 BG version.No headphone jack. Phone manufacturers are really pushing people to use Bluetooth devices, but I still love my B&W wired earbuds. I bought a short flexible USB-C to headphone jack and it works fine. Incidentally, this USB-C to headphone jack works on my Note 9 which DOES have a headphone jack.The Note 20 Ultra does not have a notification LED. This is quite a change from my Note 9, and I think it is super-dumb to eliminate the LED. You CAN set up whole-screen flash notifications, which is even dumber. Samsung has eliminated the ability to just look at your phone sitting face up on a table, etc. and see if you have messages, email, etc waiting for you. This is supremely stupid. There is one app, AODNotify available from the Play store to use the ring light around the front camera. Will experiment with this, but this means installing yet-another-app to do an essential thing the manufacturer refuses to support. Just brain-dead.Yes, this is an International Unlocked version. This phone\'s CSC region code is THL meaning it was made for Thailand. (Google ""Find SAMSUNG CSC REGION"" to find this out.)  I live in Bulgaria/EU so it remains to be seen if the phone can pick up 5G bands in Bulgaria/EU. The seller does not list the 5G bands the phone is compatible with. But the phone works fine out of the box with my Bulgarian SIM in it and can get 4G+ speeds without any problems.Not so easy in the USA. I put my AT&T SIM in the phone and it took SEVERAL trips/calls to the AT&T store/support to get it working properly beyond the stupid ""what is your IMEI"" hassle for getting a SIM card to work. AT&T will block what it considers ""legacy"" phones from its network if they don\'t recognize the phones are 4G/5G compatible. Because this is an unlocked international phone with ""strange"" model numbers, the AT&T network doesn\'t automatically recognize that it is capable of 4G/5G speeds, so it throttles it. It took several trips to the AT&T store to edit my user profile on the network to recognize this phone. It\'s a pain - so I am considering switching to Google Fi for my USA service.Overall: I like my Note 9 better than this phone except for the overall processor speed, screen, and camera. I think Samsung\'s functional ""updates"" are a step backwards from a user-friendly perspective. But we consumers have very little say in what features our phones and telecom services think are best for us.', ""The phones a little bit too big 6.9 inches the Samsung Note 10 plus is a little bit smaller 6.8 in I think it's a bit  easier to hold your hand I think Samsung I'm making your phone's a little bit too big how do you expect to hold a phone in your hand that big I think ID rather have the S8 easier to hold the only good thing about this phone is the technology nothing else"", 'SM-N986B/DS (international GSM dual sim), bought ""Used, very good condition"":throughout the Boston, MA area and around New Hampshire (Nashua to Rumney) I had between 0 (40% of the time) and a maximum of 3 bars, sporadically 4G and NEVER 5G. My calls were frequently dropped and T-Mobile said they can\'t help because they didn\'t sell this phone; same with Samsung USA because this is an international model. The 4G and 5G bands listed for this specific model (FrequencyCheck, GSMArena and others) confirm that it should be compatible with T-Mobile; is this another typical Chinese FAKE???Other than this MAJOR inconvenience, the Google Maps systematically dulled out so that the app is absolutely unusable in bright daylight.

In the end, I returned back to Xiao Mi due to the average high reviews among all their products, and the fact that I bought two Xiao Mi phones for my family members in the past, which they work smoothly. The reviews for this phone is awesome and the price is phenomenal. Sounds like quite a deal compared to other products where the users complained about the cheap built and dark spots that appear after days of use, right?Flash forward to the day I received the product. The packaging is neat and similar to any other phone with the classic box. There was a plastic wrap around the box that contained the phone, which I really appreciated. Inside, there was a phone with a thin plastic screen cover, translucent screen cover, and c-type battery + wall charger. Awesome.I was surprised that this phone already came with a screen protector. Since I have long nails that scratched my previous phone to the point where it looked like a cat had been clawing at a wall for too long, this feature was reassuring since I could always replace the screen if... I damage the screen to that point again, you know. I don't trust those nails.Moving on, the battery life on this phone is excellent. I usually can use this phone for two to three days without charging a phone - and that's coming from someone who has a self-proclaimed texting addiction. Charging the phone does take a while like other users mentioned so please try to charge the phone when you are sleeping so that you can wake up to a fully charged phone. It will be well worth it.There is a fingerprint sensor in the back of the phone, right at the perfect place for me to extend out my index finger and voila. I literally basically only use the fingerprint sensor to open the phone so I can say that it's quite good although I need to figure out a way not to occasionally accidentally open the cellular device in my pocket. Also, there are ten - don't quote me on that - fingerprint slots, which is more than enough. I input in both my left and right index finger for the sake of convenience. Just don't expect to open this phone with the fingerprint sensor on the first try after you shower. Funny enough though, I often open this phone right after I shower on the first try, soggy fingers and all.As for system features, that is where Xiao Mi truly shines. Xiao Mi devices have a range of excellent and useful features - some of which I didn't know I need. There is a second space mode, which is like a second phone that you can access through a different set of password and fingerprint. There is dual apps, which makes a copy of a certain app for two accounts. There is Do No Disturb mode, which users can set a specific time period for. There is a bedtime mode that makes the screen black and white. There is a reading mode that gives the screen a warm orange hue. The most important feature for me is the focus mode, which I use daily. You can set specific apps as a distracting app and you can't use them in focus mode unless you choose the five minute option. You can take a 5, 10, or 30 minute break. Sure, this feature will definitely not make you productive overnight since you can abuse the 30-minute break but it is something works as an assistant. You are who you make the feature to be. Do note that Xiao Mi devices come with ads with their cleaning feature and some of their own apps though. They are non-intrusive and simply help justify the quality at the price point.Oh, did I begin to mention how customizable Xiao Mi devices are? You can get different app logos, wallpapers, and screen locks through their Theme app. Some wallpapers and screen locks are also interactable. Overall, I believe that it really helps in making this device just *yours*.I can't speak for long-term durability per se since I only have this phone for three to four months now. However, the apps run smoothly and the only real lag I get is occasionally in Chrome, which is fully my fault as a loyal member of the many tab cult. Also, I drop this phone every so often and the snug, translucent screen did a good job of preventing my phone from receiving any damages. Please don't start dropping this phone everywhere to test the durability.Overall, this is an excellent phone for its price point that comes with many accessories. There are various features that are really productive and just *fun* along with customizations to personalize the device. The battery life is awesome with two to three days of use although it does take a while to charge the phone. I really recommend this product to people seeking an inexpensive phone that is solid and provides an unexpected range of useful features."", 'Super recomendoJá tenho ele a três anos e funciona muito bem..Atende as minhas necessidades', 'Minha mulher utiliza até hoje e não reclamações. funcionalidades básicas funciona legal e para alguns jogos mais leves, é de boa.', 'Produto de boa qualidade', 'Chegou muito rápido', 'Este celular es una buena opción si quieres un teléfono- celular de bajo costo y buen uso, tengo casi dos años y no me ha dado ningún problema', 'Celular muito bom.', 'Top', ""Après quelques jour d'utilisation, l'écran tactiles ne répond plus.Reçu rapidement, retourné rapidement"", 'A dos años de comprarlo puedo decir que mantiene la misma funcionalidad del principio: No es lento, no se traba, nada se ha dañado y la memoria no se ha llenado.

Latest software update allows for better OTA images delivered to your mobile app. Adding a star, from 3 to 4. AFAIK they still have access to all of your photos. :/I own three of these now and it\'s been a hit and miss experience. I called support because one of the cameras was not triggering. I was standing in front of the camera by 5 ft and it never captured a picture. The camera has fresh batteries and an external battery. The support person said, ""you needed to reposition the camera"". Let me repeat, I was standing 5ft in front of it. If it can\'t detect me standing, walking, dancing 5-10 ft in front of it, there is a bigger problem.During this call, it came to light the support person was looking through the pictures from the other camera. That is really disturbing.A support solution to another issue I was having was ""take the batteries out for 24hrs"". So I drive back out to the camera site and removed the batteries and put them back in the next day. It worked. Be sure to run them at your home for a week before taking them to the field.The support phone number often lands you in a voicemail box that is full.I have one camera that works pretty well. Universally, they trigger slower than my other brand cameras.You cannot make adjustments to the quality of the picture sent to your phone. It\'s 640x360. You have to physically retrieve the memory card to get HD images. By default, you pay $20 a month for the unlimited data service, but can only send grainy pictures. Also, no video. I\'m fine with no video. I knew that from the start.You\'ll likely want to reduce your data plan to $5 month for 650 images before the trial period is over. If you want the 26MP images, you can only burst 3 of them. Lower resolution can take more photos at once.I will say that setting up the camera was amazingly easy. They use a QR code in the app and boom, it\'s done. I did run into an issue with micro SD cards in an SD adaptor. That didn\'t work across several brands.I\'m hoping they have a software roadmap that allows for higher resolution images to be sent and some way to speed up the trigger time.Side note: I ordered one from Amazon just to leave a review for my other two I bought directly from them and one from Sportsman\'s Warehouse. I wanted to post a review last week but non-verified purchases are prohibited for this item now. Guessing they\'ve had some issues with quality and don\'t want it broadcast. $150 to give you all a heads up is worth the cost. Cheers.', 'This is my fourth brand of Camera.  My first Cellular one.  Some were name brands...some were off brands.  All were quirky.  None save one lasted more than a couple months working properly.But these Stealth Cam ones seem easy to use and after months all three (so happy with the first i got two more) are still working perfectly.I have to say...i LOVE the fact that i get pics to my cell phone.  I spend more time looking at game and trespassers than i did on Facebook!  I have a couple watching my hunting camp as sort of a cheap real time security system.  And another in my back yard in the woods watching the critters.I get a single pic from each camera once daily saying "" i am still working"".  And works good at night and day.Folks complain that the photos sent to your cell are not HD.  They are not.  But you can delete from your phone remotely and save the ones you want for later.  Keeps your camera cards from loading up with thousands of pics of leaves waving in the wind.  Then download the card to get the HD pics.I have three cameras on unlimited pics for $20 per month.

I have them pointed at the same spot, same distance but, at different angles and the AT&T will provide one third more pictures of the same activity.

I give it 4 stars because it meets my needs.  There are important pros compared to the g6, it actually has a speaker, it has a button on the side (which is close to useless because of limited software), gps easily finds satellites, it links easily and well to bluetooth earpieces and stays connected even at long ranges.  Phone volumes are good as are ringtone volumes.  I have seen reviews that said it had been difficult to get a 4g connection to AT&T.  I had no difficulty at all.There are downsides.  The instruction manual is useless.  There is no selfie light.  The rubber plug that keeps the usb-c port dry can't be put back (the manual should explain how).  The screen, great if compared to a 2008 phone, is inferior looking compared to the g6.  The worst thing for me is that sometimes swiping up fails to answer calls.  A useful feature for that button would be to answer calls.  Not having a selfie light or some other light on the front makes it hard to find out that a call or text has been missed.If I need another phone, I'd be likely to look at Oukitel again"", 'This phone is definitely worth the money.It is surprisingly heavy, definitely rugged.  After about 2 weeks of playing with it, the weight isn\'t as noticeable.  I did get a screen protector for additional durability.  It does not need a case.  Upon receiving this phone, my old Android transfered with absolutely no problems (I used my Google Account and it guided me right through the whole process quick and easy).  This phone simply prompts you along the way of completely setting it up. I have AT&T and my Mano SIM Card worked with no issues.  Phone service was up and running automatically within minutes of turning the phone on after inserting my old Nano SIM Card. For the first week, I let this phone run completely of Wi-Fi while I took my time transferring phones and getting to know this phone and the System Menu for customizations.  The Wi-Fi works great (works faster than my old phone).I played with the camera and video and had no issues with it although you may want to download a new camera/video app if you want more features available to you. The battery life is very good, great compared to the average phone.  I spent a good 4 hours straight on the phone\'s internet and different apps and it only went down to 87% (my other phone would have been long dead in that time).  It charges with the included ""C"" type cord and it seems to charge pretty quick (87% to 100% within about 30 minutes or less). The speaker is LOUD.  One of the Big factors for me is the call quality and this phone is great! Calls sound crisp, loud and clear both on my side and the receivers side.  I love the 4 GB RAM (faster and more productive than my old 2 GB RAM phone) .  Noticeable difference.  You can keep a number of apps open at the same time with no phone lagging problems and it clearly tells you how many more GB of RAM are still available to you with certain apps open.  The 32 GB internal memory is very nice (another upgrade from my old phone) and there is NOT a bunch of bloatware on the phone, you have maybe 22-26 GB of pure internal memory that is all yours.  I have only used the Pattern Unlocking Screen (no fingerprint or face recognition has been used). The phones highest data speed is 4G, so if your carrier requires 5G now or soon then this won\'t work.  It connects to my carrier great with an impressive signal strength and data speed running on the 4G.Only 2 areas that I have noticed so far that I wish were improved is I wish the screen size was bigger (although it is exactly the same size as my old phone, I just wish it was bigger) and I wish there was a notification (blinking or flashing) light on the phone to indicate you have a new SMS.  Sure, you\'ll hear the notification if you are by the phone, but if you step away and don\'t hear the notification you have to wake up your phone to see if you have an SMS notification message (I miss my flashing light on the phone itself indicating there\'s a new SMS waiting for me).I have shown this phone to other people and it is well received.  My GF wants one now.Oh, when you get it, there should be a little card in the box offering to send you a FREE 32 GB Micro SD Card.  All you have to do is write a review (good or bad) and email the company a screen shot of your review and they will send it right to you.  They are very responsive to your email.I bought the additional 2 year warranty.  It basically covers anything that could happen to the phone and takes over when your initial limited warranty that comes with the phone expires.  The additional warranty even covers things the initial limited warranty doesn\'t cover all from the time you get your new phone.  For example, if you somehow crack your screen it is fully covered from day one with the extended warranty.  Amazon sponsors the extended warranty through Asurion Protection Plan.  It even covers FREE technical support.I would definitely purchase this phone again if I was looking to replace another Android.  This phone is a gem.THIS REVIEW WAS NOT WRITTEN TO IMPRESS ANYONE OR ANY COMPANY FOR COMPENSATION OR ANYTHING ELSE. THEY DO OFFER A FREE 32 GB MICRO SD CARD FOR WRITING AN HONEST REVIEW, GOOD OR BAD.  I WROTE THIS REVIEW FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND IMPRESSION OF THIS OUKITEL W5 PHONE.8/21/2021 UPDATE:  At about 3 months of having the phone I noticed a significant SLOW DOWN of the internet coming up and going to any web page.  I have tried all the recommended steps to speed back up the internet including clearing my internet cache with no improvement.  It does this using WiFi and using just my 4G Data (with 4 bars of signal).  I don\'t know what the problem is.This month (FIVE MONTHS AFTER BUYING THE CELL PHONE), I am noticing not only the slow internet, but the battery won\'t charge to 100%.  Using one battery cord, it will only charge to 84% and using other cords to test it out, it will only charge to 94%.  I have tried everything recommended including running a battery tester/diagnotic (which said that the battery is good), restarting the phone, cleaning the charger connector to the phone and (as mentioned before) different chargers with no improvement.  The battery even seems to run down faster.  The last that was recommended to try is resetting the phone back to manufacturer settings for which I have NOT tried due to how long it takes to set everything up again even using my Google Back-up files.  I\'ll update you if or when I reset the phone.Despite getting the warranty, I have not contacted them yet with the problems of the slow internet or not charging to 100%.  Again, I will update this if or when I contact the warranty provider (Asurion I think it is or maybe I just contact the seller since it is still within the sellers warranty, I think).  It is all frustrating and unexpected with this seemingly quality phone.  Everything else still works great, but, because of these new problems I have dropped my rating of the phone from 5 stars to 3 stars.', 'I bought this phone as a GPS and Wifi device mostly for my motorcycle, so my review doesn\'t cover cell phone and carrier specific items.I think many people that look at this phone might also be looking at the Armor X series for a rugged phone, and I had both the WP5 and an Armor X7 and did a comparison.  Spoiler, the WP5 won.I set it up both and ran them side by side for battery, photos, GPS, and overall usage. The WP5 won hands down, and I don\'t think it was close. Side by side photos were the biggest difference. I wanted a GPS dashboard phone that could take better than decent photos without getting my iPhone out at every stop. The Armor X7 photos were junk. Both inside, outdoors and in low light. The WP5 is not an iPhone for sure, but it was markedly better in all conditions and at least 80-85% as good as the iPhone8. Next, overall Android operating system response also went to the WP5. Both right out of the box had Android 10 and very little bloat which is nice, but the WP5 felt smoother and faster than the X7. The X7 felt sluggish even at times and took longer to execute the same operations. Uploading photos to GPhotos for example to compare on the PC was really slow. The camera alone was enough for me to drop the X7, but add in the sluggish performance and it was a no brainer.Battery life is crazy good (compared to iPhones). Went 5 days with 0 charging. I decided today to charge at 10% left, so probably could have finished out the 6th day. That included GPS screen on usage for a bunch of trail riding, downloading all the maps and apps to get started, playing around on it, and taking a few photos. Charge time from 10% to 100% was almost exactly 4 hours @ 2.0 A. The downside is this thing is huge!  Photos attached show it next to the X7.  We\'ve taken to calling it the ""lead brick"" around my house.  It\'s definitely rugged and feels that way.  Raised edges on the screen side mean you can use it without a case and set it face down on a table without worrying.GPS seemed to be spot on as well. I did a 1 K walk around with both the WP5 and iPhone8 side by side and the tracks are really close. I also mapped both my rides on routes I\'ve ridden before so I could see the track differences. Tracked in Avenza Maps for both. The WP5 overlaps the other tracks from May and June on the same trail very well.  Also compared to my Fitbit Ionic GPS, and it was matching my Strava tracks for the same route too. If there is an issue with GPS on the phone, mine did not experience it. I\'m very comfortable using it for GPS duty in the future.Brightness was good. Still visible in outside direct sun. It\'s not as good as the iPhone, but better than the Armor X7 for sure. No concerns using it and seeing while riding down the county roads to the trail heads.If I was carrying it around in my hand all day, it might get tiring.  But it\'s truly a 5 day battery life kinda phone even with a lot of usage.  I was worried it was too big at first and thought the X7 was a better fit, but the other pros outweight the weight and size con significantly.I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for big battery life and a smooth Android experience in a very rugged package.', 'This is a super rugged, budget phone. As far as I can tell, there is a sealed plastic case that holds all the electronics, then a rubber, and metal shell is installed around that. It would be difficult to repair this phone if it was broken, but they are so inexpensive and tough, that it\'s likely not an issue.Waterproof:I frequently take this phone into the hot shower with me to read articles in the morning while I wake up. The touchscreen will freak out a little when wet, but that\'s normal behavior for a capacitive touch screen; I just try to hold it out of the water. Also if the speaker grill on the lower left corner of the phone gets wet, it will completely smother any sound the speaker can make. This is also normal for most types of speakers. Once your phone is dry, the speaker will work again.Battery:The battery in this thing has lasted me over four days before. I had over 12 hours of screentime, and still had over 20%. I don\'t play any games or anything, but I frequently read the news, and use this phone to organize my day at my job. 100% charge typically lasts 3 consecutive work days, so even though the rubber plug that covers the charging port is very difficult for me to take off (I usually have to use a tool),  I don\'t have to charge the phone often so it\'s not super annoying. It takes like 8 hours to fully charge this phone, but you rarely wind it down to that point, and a couple hours of charge is usually enough to last more than a day.Fingerprint Reader:The Fingerprint reader works fine most of the time. It\'s not super snappy, like a flagship phone, but it will still pick up your fingerprint 99% of the time. Sometimes it glitches on me in a strange way.  Glitch:If you slide your phone screen-up on bare skin (like setting it on your leg), the fingerprint reader sometimes goes berserk and tries to scan your leg as a finger. It does it so fast that it will lock your phone with the screen on saying ""too many attempts."" Then when you hit the power button to try to put the phone to sleep it will just turn itself back on a bunch of times. You can fix this, if you unlock your phone using the code, and just avoid putting your fingerprint reader against bare skin.Summary:Overall, I really like this phone. I had a more expensive phone before, and accidentally smashed it in a freak accident. I wanted something cheaper because I realized I mostly use my phone for navigation and reading news articles.  I\'m often pretty clumsy and drop things a lot due to wrist problems, and this caught my eye. It\'s super heavy, so sometimes it stresses my wrists when using it one-handed, but I try not to use it that way. It\'s worth it for the crazy battery life.Cons:- This is It\'s big and heavy- Like almost twice as thick as a flagship phone.- It\'s annoying to get the rubber plug over the charging port off- Fingerprint reader sometimes thinks normal skin is a finger and will try to unlock the phone leading to a confusing glitch.-No headphone jackPros+ The battery lasts so long, you don\'t need to charge it every day+ The thing is fully waterproof. I\'ve taken it into the hot shower dozens of times and it still works perfect.+ You can stand this phone up on end because it\'s so thick+ You don\'t need a case.', 'So the good things are it does seem durable, the battery life is amazing, and it did work with metro. Now for the not so good. I\'m not a huge picture taker but if you need any sort of photos this is NOT the phone for you. My son has a flip phone with a better quality camera. The volume for this phone must\'ve been made with bat hearing in mind if you\'re on a phone call be prepared to have this thing on speaker and right up to your ear because that\'s the only way to hear a fragmented version of what the other end is saying Lastly the little charging port cover which makes this phone ""waterproof"" stopped going into the hole on the first week. The mechanics of how they put the little flap on there was really poorly laid out. I\'ve had this phone for a little while now. Its suited my needs other then the camera issue but I could see others being really unhappy with it it\'s all about what you need.', ""TL/DR: I bought this phone as a spare to have that I wouldn't have to worry about breaking. It's battery life is crazy good and the performance is decent. The phone is well worth the price point, but don't expect too much compared to a fancy flagship phone. Camera is pretty poor for close-ups (see pictures of chargers that were taken with this phone).After having this phone for almost a month, I have a lot to say about it. First and foremost, it is everything that it's advertised as. It certainly appears to be very durable and rugged, and it's operating performance is good enough. It comes with a charger, cable, and an adaptor to use it for charging other devoices. Packaging is nice and shipping was on-time. Some of my discussion points are below.1. It comes with rubber covers for the charging port and SIM card slot. This is something I greatly appreciate because it prevents dirt and sand from getting inside the charging port. This is something all rugged phones should have. My Blackview phone does not have this cover for the ports, and I constantly have to clean out the charging port because sand and dirt is always getting into it.2. The battery is great. This phone is my spare phone, so normally I am only using it on Wifi for Pokémon Go and streaming videos. This phone lasts much longer than my main phone and so I do the battery intensive stuff on this one. I have gone entire weekends without charging this phone. Although, keep in mind that this is not typical usage because I do not use this for email, calls, texts, or navigation. I do, however, use this phone to charge my other phone in a pinch.3. The OS is very limited, which is to be expected at this price point. It runs on 64-bit OS, which I was happy with because some apps are stating to move away from supporting 32-bit OS. Because of the price, I am very forgiving for the basic OS. The only two issues that bother me are the programmable button and accessing the phone's settings. I have been unable to create a settings shortcut on the main screen, and so the only way I can access settings is by swiping down from the top and using the settings button in the notifications bar. I would really like a settings icon on the main screen, and I haven't been able to figure out how to get one there. Second, the programmable button can only be programmed for a long press, and is limited to doing Nothing, Torch (Flashlight), Camera, Outdoor Tool, or SOS. This is incredibly limiting, as my other phones have always ben able to use this button to open apps, and be programmed for a different action for short and long press.3. No headphone jack. This is something I hate. I like to use my phones for FM radio, which requires a wired headphone connection because the headphone wire becomes the antenna. I obviously can't do that without a headphone jack. I also cannot listen to the radio while charging my phone without a headphone jack. Also, the phone does not come with a USB-C headphone adaptor or set of headphones."", ""I bought this phone for my daughter who has managed to let her 2 year break her phone twice this year... we used apple care for the first one but due to it happening so soon they would not cover the second damage until later this year. I washed something cheap yet bought from a company not a person on marketplace cause you never know what they did with the phone prior. Anyway this one sounded durable based on the description. She needs something tough cause I can’t afford to keep buying phone after phone.Arrived and I laughed cause the quality is as described rugged lol... this phone is heavy, tough and thick..... it’s actually really nice but it is pretty thick!!!! The phone is about 3/4 inches. Kinda like an iPhone with an Otterbox that can’t come off.. the weight is much heavier than iPhone..She was able to get it up and running quickly.. she insert her SIM card from her T-Mobile and few minutes later it was working.. it syncs to our WiFi with no issue, I played with it multiple times and saw that it ran smoothly and didn’t have much of Lag, my grand daughter watches her learning shoes, my daughter downloaded all the apps she normally uses. The camera works great, pic quality seems clear and good to me, the battery life is I assume good or she would've hollared and complained by now!! (She companion’s alot everything) I’ve seen my grand daughter drop, throw and slam it and it’s still working.... if that shall change I will update this review. We have not tested it in water so we don’t know how great the water resistance is. The fingerprint feature works good, I see my daughter get in her phone effortlessly.This is a temporary fix till either she can afford to buy a phone herself or till I can use the AppleCare later in the year... I plan to take this phone back from her once she gets her replacement so I can keep it as a back up for when any of my 5 kids break their phones or if I ever needed one. The value is actually more than reasonable, $150 verse $800-1000 phone that can do the same thing. I personally would have no problem using this phone for myself i just wouldn’t be able to carry it in my hands too long cause of the weight but to carry in my purse would be ok.So far from what I can see this phone met our expectations although it wouldn’t be a first choice when phone shopping but it is definitely a reliable back up phone of good features and quality!!! It is durable and strong!!If you hang wreckless kids or a husband that doesn’t care alot brand and works in construction this would be a really good phone for him!! My husband said he would use this for work cause he too has broken more phones than I own!Good phone, good deal!!!"", ""If your looking for an unlocked phone that brags about its awesome battery life and the ability to use 2 Sims and a SD card to expand the memory. This is not the phone. The battery won't last a full day if your a heavy multi tasker and power user I have killed the battery in 12 hrs. Plus if your trying to charge it while using it forget that idea. Doesn't work. To charge this thing you have to turn it off and let it charge for 24 hrs just to get 100% full battery. And don't even think about being able to use 2 sim cards and a SD card at the same time not going to happen as the photos show you can only have 1 sim installed an the SD card or you can have 2 Sims with no SD card. Yes it's heavy and weighs a ton compared to most phones. I will going back to Blu it another company and getting rid of this p.o.s. the processor is very slow my wife's of which only has a 1 gb processor runs faster than this. This is supposedly to be a 2 gb quad core processor with 4 gb running memory. It always says it has less than 1gb available. This is a boated over bragged about paperweight. I regret buying it. It's been nothing but a pain in the ass. The only way the battery last the way it says. Don't install any apps. Don't do anything but check your email and Facebook. Cause even the battery saver doesn't work. You can't turn it on when you want to. If you plug it in to charge it the battery saver turns off. And there is no way for you to turn it on.. another thing the battery percentage that is usually beside the battery  so you can see just how much battery you have left. I added a photo zoomed in so you can see it. They put the percentage inside the battery and it's white so it's damn near invisible. Yes the phone feels like it has a solid case that's the only thing going for it in my book. The layout and look of the O.S. in it looks outdated and too simplfied. It doesn't allow you to make needed changes or adjustment that even cheap LG phones allow you to do  the LG K51 is a thousands time a better phone if it had a solid case like what's wrapped around the wp5 and was unlocked."", ""First, this phone is beefy, I love it, it feels strong and definitely brings a presence with it.  However, I have noticed if placed in my jacket pocket the heft of it can actually be a downside at times the phone's momentum has caused it to jump from my pocket unexpectedly and wow does it thud! To it's Protective outer build I give thankful sighs of relief (so far) and not so much as a scratch.  Family friends and anyone that's held it for a closer look can't believe it's not a case and they are actually complementing the outer phone itself.  The UI and features of android seem to be much like a regular smartphone, I was initially worried it might be substandard and or generic feeling, but quite pleased by it.  The battery is outstanding, Wifi gets great reception, and I had a bit of trouble (mostly carrier settings/instructions not with phone) but I eventually was able to get my FreedomPop Sim to work just fine with it. So far very satisfied with the money spent, and in all not really a whole lot more than I would usually spend for a new device, slight loss on specs, but haven't even noticed once, and with any luck this one will last through far more than my others.  Rawr!"", ""Crazy battery life. Takes 13 or some odd hours to charge because it lasted me 4 days! I love the smart button you can customize it picking camera, flashlight or outdoor tools which reads plumb, level, but my favorite by far is it tells me how loud I am with a decibel sensor. Great for hunters or for me I'm a night owl and it helps me maintain my noise discipline so I don't wake people in the house. Only things I don't like about this design is the fingerprint reader, I wish it was indented a little better so I could feel it like most other phones, and the speaker isnt the best but I rarely use it. Between my bluetooth speaker, earbuds and aux cord in the car I don't mind. But one thing I liked was I forgot when I bought this was to buy a case for this phone but when it arrived I realized that this phone is built so we'll I wouldn't need one. I know it's gorilla glass but just to be safe. Wasn't expecting much with this phone because of the price except id probably return it if I didn't like it but was pleasantly surprised when I started setting it up, no regrets and highly recommend!""]"

I have even used this phone down in Cuba with a Cubacel sim card and it sounds clear too. Battery life is pretty darn good as well. Also the 512mb ram does not seem to be a problem either though I do wish for more. my only vices so far is 1) that it takes several attempts for the bluetooth to find my hands free (but once connected it works fine) and 2) the micro sd card needs to be taken out and inserted a couple of times before it is recognized.

After browsing several phones decided on the Blu Dash 5.0 plus.  Very easy setup when it arrived and only had to make a couple changes for the Straight talk to work.  We've had it for a couple weeks now and so far so good.  Display is great.

Took the battery out and found that the positive contact, for the battery, on the phone had broken off.

Haven't used it much so far - bought for use on an upcoming trip. Since getting a global access sim, I've tried a few calls, messages and WIFI access - so far its ok. If it works as well overseas as here, should be okay."", 'i love this phone, i am still using it to this day and i have seen it out preform many of my friends phones costing 5 or 6 times as much. the only mark against it is the small internal storage. i have added a micro sd card but some things have to go on the internal storage and it fills up quickly. 10 out of 10 would buy again', 'On this listing, it shows there is 4gb of Internal Storage but on the phone there is actually 2gb and the system used 700mb of it so that leaves it to 1.32gb for your apps.

This is to me the thing I like the least about this phone. In standby the battery will last mind you, but once you're using it to, let's say, instant message via whatsapp and facebook with a little gaming and music in-between, you'll get around 6 - 7 hours...that's what I've seen so far...since it's an 8-core processor with mediatek, I was expecting stellar battery life...but screen on time hasn't impressed me much in as much as it is limited to within 12 hours instead of within 24 hours...they could have done alot better with the battery...hopefully the update will make better use of battery or maybe they could create a better 2000 mah or perhaps a larger mah (2500 mah) battery to fit the phone...(still, consider the price...it is better or as good as many other devices out there at the same price)7) The speaker is very clear and clean...loud enough too for my liking and the phone itself comes with a beautiful music player that offers several sound effects like 'plate reverb', 'large room' etc along with different play modes like classical, dance, hip hop, pop, etc...I said before that 'I don't feel the desire to get another player from google play store' but I redownloaded fusion music player which allows users to cut a song at any point to make a desired ringtone(it also allows online content and other useful features so...)...With respect to the speakers though, I do think that they probably could have placed it at the front considering how much bezel that is present below the capacitive buttons or they could have placed a smaller one there...but it works well on the back nonetheless...(lean it onto something solid when playing videos and the sound resounds beautifully)8) The WI-FI antennae seems pretty strong...I was travelling around with this and it's been picking up WI-FI signals from homes as I passed by with more than a few bars...it connected to my home WI-FI very quickly...9) Call quality is very good...I only made a few short calls so far but individuals hear me clearly and they sound clearly also with no background noise and no drop calls...so far so good. There is a setting that allows me to suppress my background noise during calls too.10) Both cameras function well and take clear pictures...the flash on the back is bright enough to take good pictures at night...the interface is minimalistic and clean...one issue is that whenever the video icon is touched the camera automatically starts recording video...don't know if I can change this in the settings yet but I'll keep looking into it...11) I haven't tried out the bluetooth as yet so I can't say how stable it is in use yet...12) The headphones aren't so special...don't expect to experience the best sounds from them but they are good enough and come with a mic...13) Something I noticed is that when using the screen for typing I sometimes have to press the same area 2-3 times or wait for a second or two to get a letter out...I went into audio settings and disabled the vibration feedback and it helped a little but it still happens though less frequently...it's therefore one of two things: (i) It's a software problem which can be fixed with the update or (ii) My particular phone has a minor fault...still this doesn't take away from the usability of the phone since it only happens ever so often and lasts for 2-3 seconds...14) I ran antutu benchmark several times and the highest score I ever got was 28,887...RAM usage is great and shows up better than most phones in comparison (3084 vs 1387 on the galaxy s4)...15) It may take some time to get used to the position of the capacitive buttons...their background light goes off after only a few seconds without interaction and I sometimes had to search a bit for them...in a well lit area, there isn't a problem seeing them without their background light on...I think that we should be allowed to change how long they light up for though...hopefully that is included in the update...All-in-all this phone works...and there is no need to pay 400-700 us dollars on a brand phone like Samsung or HTC when you have blu coming through with so much to offer at an acceptable price...compared to the moto g at the same price you get alot more value for money.UPDATE(Dec-15-2014): I've been using the phone for a few months with minor issues until now: I'm finally in a position to really try the bluetooth but  so far I'm very disappointed; I've tried it with several bluetooth devices and am yet to get a stable connection...that sucks since I really use bluetooth of recent including my computer which works just fine with the bluetooth usb device I ordered from Inateck. Other than the bluetooth, another issue I think needs be resolved is the lack of ability to make the power button a camera snapper (and the pictures are amazing btw)...sometimes it's hard to snap oneself having to search for the exact point on the screen to touch with ones finger...in addition, it seems to change settings every now and then with regards to my music ringtones (though I suspect my music app may have something to do with that): the ringtone I use changes on its own for whatever reason.I hope BLU resolves all these issues because with all these things I don't think this phone is worth the $200 they are asking for- especially considering that other phones in their line-up are cheaper without these issues. So I'm bringing down my rating to a 3 until I see reason to do otherwise."", 'I was unsure about my purchase on this device seconds after purchase. I have tried many budget android devices in hopes of finding a low cost but high performing tablet or phone. Lets say that I haven\'t been too lucky.Over the past 2 weeks I have been researching all of Blu\'s phones and I thought I had found the one! I was looking for 4 things I wanted most from a phone.1. SD Card. Memory is a big one for me as I have a large music collection and don\'t want to waste my data on streaming music. What I need is a device that is compatible with 128GB micro sd card and this one is. The Amazon description says up to 64GB, I was very happy to see that 128GB worked. I did have one issue and it could have been the app I was using but I had to tell iSyncr app to send the music to the internal memory not the SD card to get the files on the SD card. Very Strange but it worked.2. The display had to be as good as a iPhone 4. I can\'t use any display that isn\'t IPS and low resolution. If I place my phone on my desk and look at it from a extreme angle I want it to look the same as looking directly at it. This phone has a great screen, I would rate it a 9 out of 10. I was very happy with the quality of the IPS display. The bright vivid colors and the touch input was dead on every time. The one place that it did disappoint me was in the OS, the gradients where not smooth so not sure if this was Ice Cream Sandwich or the display.3. Speed!!! Budget Android devices lag very bad when scrolling through large blog posts or any page with a lot of pictures. The speed of the Octa core processor didn\'t disappoint me. I have a very large music collection and running Player Pro in album view scrolled and rendered album art very quickly.4. Battery life. I really can\'t talk to much about the battery life as I have only used it for two days. The first day the battery had 50% life out of the box. After charging it to 70% I started loading on the apps and using wifi to transfer my music over to the sd card in the phone. the wifi transfer ran the battery down very fast and had to be plugged in before it ran out.The biggest disappointment and the reason why I sent this phone back to Amazon is that I couldn\'t get the Bluetooth to stream audio smoothly. I have Bluetooth in my car and the music skipped like a scratched cd. This could be a bug in the Ice Cream Sandwich rom ""The phones OS"" and could be fixed when the phone gets the Kit Kat update.Overall I love this phone and would have kept it if the Bluetooth worked. If Blu updates this phone to Kit Kat I may try this phone again to see if the problem has been fixed.Not sure if it\'s possible but stock Google play rom on this phone would make it shine and remove any quirks I found like no access to quick toggles in the notification pull down menu. A extra gig of ram would have really helped in a few places too.', ""I have had my Life 8 for a few weeks now and so far have no complaints. I waited to post this review until the Kit-Kat update so that I could see if there were any pro's or con's that that brought along. I have none so far. The phone, for me, has been great. The only thing that I am not thrilled about are the lack of a notification LED. I keep my phone on silent 80% of the time so the LED would be a nice addition for me, however, the lack of one does not make the phone any worse and it just a personal preference. I have had no issues in speed or performance. The screen is nice and crisp, the battery lasts all day. The only thing I really still cant get used to is the bar at the bottom...I always accidentally click there instead of where the actual buttons are. I have the yellow one and the back is not as opaque as I would like it to be. I can see the battery if I am looking straight at it. If I were only glancing or were a few meters away I would not be able to tell, but I know it's there so it's another personal gripe. I fell the orange and pink would not have this issue. All in all, it has been everything I expected it to be. I can do essentially everything I can do on my iPhone 5s. I would love to have NFC for Google wallet. I will likely buy another as a spare. My last Blu phone was still going strong after a year, but I lost it. So, this time I want to be prepared."", ""UPDATE, Day 2:Oddly, when I called AT&T to check the IMEI with them, the number DID show this phone. I wanted to make sure to relay that. I'm not technically minded enough to know why it was first showing incorrectly.I'm upgrading my reading to a 3, because I am torn. I'm really liking the phone so far, but am not thrilled with the scratches. I know it's currently under review, but it was not when I purchased it.My experience thus far:- The speed is very fast compared to my now dead Samsung Galaxy S4 I337. Guessing that's a bloatware issue on the Galaxy. This is what makes me want to keep the phone!- Bluetooth works well in my cheap car. When I tried streaming Google Play, the Bluetooth went out every few minutes. Using downloaded Amazon music played seamlessly, and the Navigation worked fine as well.-Once I upgraded to Kit Kat, I lost my 4G, like others have mentioned. I have not noticed a difference in performance, but I do not game or watch videos.......................The IMEI number on my phone is for a Nokia manufactured in 2004.Caution:I just received the phone and will update after some use. As stated by others, I doubt my phone is new. It arrived with the battery package open and a hole where the tape was sealing it. The screen had a few scratches. And, it came set up in Spanish. Disappointed so far. My Samsung died and I was looking for a reasonable replacement until I'm out of my AT&T contract. Thinking I should have paid a little more!"", ""When I first got it thought it was a great cell!! Tried to do update to kit kat & got message saying that I had the most current version.Called Blu & was told to do a hard recovery by holding power & volume button at the same time to enter recovery mode. Did that & that did not fix it so just it go & would settle for Jellybean 4.2.2. Then a week later wireless update showed up, so I checked it & it was for kit kat 4.4.2. So I went a head & downloaded the update. I was so sorry I did as it changed the phone dialer to a different version that I did not like. Well that was an easy fix as found one I liked in play store, but the thing that I hated the most was that it changed my settings from 4G to only 3G speed. I called my carrier & they tried over the phone to help me fix it, but no way it was the way the phone was now & it did not support 4G anymore. I called Blu to see if they could help  was told it is my carriers settings. I asked them about going back to Jellybean & they wanted $25 to do so. If a phone does not work rite that should be covered under warranty. I ended up sending the cell phone back to Amazon for a replacement. I don't recommend doing the kit kat update as I read that sometimes the device does not have the hardware to support everything that kit kat has to offer. If you want the newer Android then buy a cell phone that has that version pre-installed so you know it has been tested to work with that version of Android. Got the replacement today & set everything up & so far is working well. I will write a review on the new cell after I have had it for about a week. I will not ever update an Android OS to a newer version again. I will just be happy with what the cell came with. PS I got my 4G speed back again."", ""Only thing is the zoom is blurry even at its highest setting. don't plan on doing you coming in if you're trying to get quality pictures with clearNess and no pixelization. but the hardware it is fast enough the OCTA core processor with 1 gig Arandas doesn't really slow down I have a cache and cookie app that watch them out daily so it keeps it running to so multitasking with this phone is not a problem the note 4 is the only thing but I would say Competing with this super fast clean slim and long lasting battery life so pretty much beats out the note for because overall cost reliability speed and durability call and quality is awesome for the price 150 no phone That's out there righ now can't even come cloand this one has no bloatware its straight up Android that's it so what you put on there is only thing  going to slow it down and I've tried apps running at the same time and it breezes right  through."", ""Edit Aug 9th, 2014:Had to return the phone because it wouldn't stop skipping when playing slacker or pandora.... furthermore, when you connect a set of bluetooth headphones to the phone they stop working after a couple of minutes.  google this and you will see it's not just this phone I had it's all of the blu life 8 phones.  This is not cool.  Returned it for a blu life pure but it's not much better. stay away from blu phones.Just got this phone today and here are my first impressions:Pros:Nice build qualitybright screenNice included accessoriesCons:screen protector that was already installed had a lot of bubbles under it so I had to rip it offno LTE but I already knew that so I'm not marking off for that2nd sim signal meter won't go away so everytime you turn phone on it notifies you the 2nd slot is missing a simThats all I can think of right now so I will update it as needed but overall this is a great phone for $200 and I would recommend it to other people."", 'love this phone, not a very tech savvy person but works well for me. its 5"" which means its big but not too big nice when watching videos my only draw back if any is the battery size 2000 mAh.  I think it could be a bit bigger such as 2500 - 3000 mAh which means it has to be charged often depending on what you are doing, other than that I like it alot.  oohh everywhere I go everyone seems to like it because of its unique color and the fact that its thin and sleek. didn\'t give it a 5 star because of battery', 'After buying this phone for a friend, she loved how it worked but it cracked when slipping out of a chair and falling 11 inches and it ruined the ENTIRE mid section of the input area, which denotes something of a ""cheap"" screen to me. When we ordered parts to repair it, we found that the wiring for the screen was so tucked and glued it was a lost cause and we had to just throw the phone in the trash (and i replace laptop LCDs for a living along with a few phones). It was just too much of a hassle so we just bought a different phone.This phone could be called a ""nice"" throw-away phone, kinda like the ones you get in Dollar General. Use it, you will enjoy it, but protect it like it\'s an infant child because it will break at the drop of a dime (so to speak) and it\'s a serious hassle to even get into with all the gluing going on inside of it.', ""I love this phone.  The only reason a gave it 4 stars is because of the battery life, I have to charged it everyday and compared to cheaper Blu phone which I have had (Blu Advance 4.0), I could play games for hours and didn't have to charge it for about two or so days.Other than that the phone works great even the camera surprisingly.""]"
B00D64QJZC,"BLU Studio 5.0 S D570a Unlocked Dual Sim Phone with Quad-Core 1.2GHz Processor, Android 4.1 JB, 5.0-inch IPS High Resolution Display, and 8MP Camera (White)",Smartphones,S$310.41,https://www.amazon.sg/BLU-D570a-Quad-Core-Processor-Resolution/dp/B00D64QJZC/ref=sr_1_450?qid=1695968288&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051%2Cp_72%3A6469119051%2Cp_36%3A20000-150000&rnid=6450031051&s=electronics&sr=1-450,https://www.amazon.sg/BLU-D570a-Quad-Core-Processor-Resolution/product-reviews/B00D64QJZC/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,3.1,"['My feeling is that the BLU Studio 5.0s has an outstanding cost/benefit, especially because other unlocked smartphones here at amazon.com, with similar specs, would be priced around $300 or more. The quad core 1.2GHz CPU and 1GB memory makes the response time of this android device quite quick. The GPU is lacking a bit, but this won\'t be an issue for non-heavy gamers, because it can handle most of the current 3D applications quite well anyway. In overall, I\'m really satisfied with my purchase.I also experienced some of the issues the other reviewers were reporting. For instance, since I also use only 1 SIM (for a T-Mobile, prepaid service), it displays at the bottom of the locked screen a message indicating that only emergency calls are allowed (because SIM 2 is empty), and if we accidentally touch that message (when trying to unlock the screen) the phone will send you to the dialing screen, which is quite annoying.The above issue is not a big deal if you change the screen unlock method to something other than ""swipe"", because it is not so easy to touch the ""emergency call"" by accident when your unlocking method is PIN, password, or some special ""pattern"".Additionally, as also stated by another reviewer, the portion near the main camera gets quite hot, especially when I use it while plugged to power cord. I believe that region is where most of the core components of this phone are concentrated, so I\'m concerned about overheating.No surprise, when the phone (i.e. the place near the camera) got hot at a certain degree, the touch screen started to get very wild (actually, the touch sensor, not the display itself). In my case, when I touch somewhere in the screen (and keep it touched, for example), the sensor suddenly started to detect multiple touches in nearly random places, so it started to press lots of links and accidentally deleted some of my icons (that\'s when I first realized the problem). In such situation, it gets practically impossible to use the on-screen keyboard, because it will start inserting lots of letters randomly.Fortunately, this never happened when the portion near the camera was sufficiently cool.From the spec I saw in other web sites, they mentioned the phone comes with A-GPS feature too, but I could not find a place to see if it was really enabled. I had to install an application called ""A-GPS Switch"" to see if A-GPS was enabled (wasn\'t enabled in my case), and to turn it on.Some apps also detects presence of a magnetic field sensor, but not sure if this is a valid report, because I never tried using the sensor for something.Since this is very thin, I found the back cover hard to open (I was afraid of braking the plastic and/or my nail), so I took a while to insert the SIM/battery/SD card. I\'ll use a small flat-head screwdriver (in order to insert it to the slit and gently twist it in order to remove the back cover) the next time.In summary, the followings are the cons and pros I could identify so far:Cons:- heat (associated with the fact that touch sensors may get really wild);- quite difficult to open (a problem perhaps caused because it is thin);- BLU\'s manual/website/documentation were not very helpful.- 4GB of internal storage, but considerable portion used by OS and default files/applications, so about 1.4GB is allocated for user files, and about 1.4GB is allocated for user application (so, you may need an SD card for your files and application, but not all applications can be installed in SD cards, unless you root your phone);- Adobe Flash is not actually enabled (I needed that, because I used to develop flash assets myself - so wanted to test them in my new phone). I had to install it ""manually"", because it is not supported in Android 4.X anymore. However, HTML5 is supported, so most of new and elaborated web sites should work fine. Note: this is not a problem only on this phone, because it seems to be an issue on all Android 4.X phones.- Adreno 203 GPU is not so good compared to other competitors (but it is reasonably good, because could play some 3D games normally),- It\'s only around $20-$30 cheaper than BLU life play, which seems to show better performance (but the battery life of studio 5.0s seems to be better, and the design of studio 5.0s is nice, so not entirely sure).Pros:- Quad core processor is fast for ordinary usage;- 1GB memory works very well, unless you try to run lots of applications in parallel.- Thin, nice design.- 5-touch large screen, which is also easy to see (you may find it difficult to find compatible cases, pouches or holsters, though).- Great cost/performance (way better than competitors), so you can eventually use the money you saved in order to buy better accessories, like fast SD cards, or perhaps a holster to carry it, you choose.- 8MP main camera works nice. The secondary camera also fills the need (e.g. video conference).- Equipped with GPS, accelerometer, proximity, luminosity sensors (well, most of contemporary smart phones also do, though).- Good battery life so far.The cons looks larger in text, but I\'m overall satisfied.As in any android device, this one will only start ""working"" after you finish configuring everything and install your favorite applications. I strongly suggest you to also buy a class 10 (or faster, if there are) SD card (limited to 32GB maximum size, though) in order to guarantee enough space for large applications/files, while keeping the speed consistently fast, so data access won\'t become a major performance bottleneck.And don\'t forget to install some antivirus, especially if you are going to enable your phone to install applications not ""signed"" by google play (e.g. adobe flash). ;-)(Update 09/27/2014)After 1 year of usage, the power button started to fail (sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\'t), so I had to use some apps to use the proximity sensor to make it sleep or wake up.I guess this power button (and related components) is not made to last. Of course, I need to also consider the fact that I was sometimes hit by rain when carrying it in a pocket (and the product description obviously doesn\'t say it\'s water proof).Other things seem to be working fine, though. Surprisingly, the battery is still fine, even though I thought this would be the 1st thing to die.', ""To preface, I moved from an unlocked Samsung Galaxy S (the first one) to the Blu Studio 5.0. I am running it on the T-mobile's $30/month plan (unlimited text/data 100 min talk). I've been using the Studio 5.0 for almost a month now.Pro: Price, speed, OSCons: Randomly turns off, Dual SIM, Manuals, Headphone jack audio, Battery (All elaborated below)You really can't beat the price. I went in looking for a functional smart phone that would be under $300, and this by far had the best specs. The smart phone is much faster than my previous setup, though it is slower than my friend who does have a Galaxy S4. Depending on the kind of coverage I have, it will take 3-10 seconds to return a google search result on my phone. The setup for Android 4.1 doesn't have any issues I have encounter thus far, and seems to work flawlessly. The primary camera takes good photos, as long as you are not zooming in, and the flash works fine. I am able to run every app I have tried to download so far without having any platform issues.Primary issue I have had with this phone so far is that it has randomly restarted 6 times now while I have been trying to use it. The reboot time was about 7 or 8 seconds every times, but it is still annoying to have it shut off for a bit while being used as a GPS. I currently run the phone with only 1 SIM card. Because of this, the phone shows that I am missing a SIM card, so it always offers me 'emergency calls only' on the locked screen. I have hit this once so far. As far as I can tell, there is no way to have the phone disable the dual SIM card capabilities. This leads into the next issue. This phone currently does not have a full manual. It comes with a 15 page cheat sheet, but there is no full fledge manual currently available. I'm able to figure out how to do most things I have wanted to do, but when it comes to the more specific things, like knowing what all the symbols mean across the top of the screen, I don't have a clue what they mean. Finally, the speaker on the phone is nice and loud, but for some reason the audio through the headphone jack is much quieter. I can hear music fine when sitting in a quiet office, but it is next to impossible to hear audio through the included headphones if you are on a plane. Side-by-side, the speaker I hook up to my phone is almost twice as loud when hooked up via bluetooth rather than headphone jack.The battery is able to survive a day with casual use, but it does drain fast and get hot if constantly used. On wifi, I am able to stream 6 hours of netfix before the battery dies. While at work, I am able to play back 8 hours of audio continuously and have about 1/4 battery left. I am also able to run 3 hours of google maps with turn by turn directions without having it die.Overall, I really do like the phone. Though I did list a good amount of downsides, that are heavily outweighed by the general capabilities this phone does have. I am able to work around all the issues I have had thus far. Really, I didn't expect much functionality out of a $200 phone, but it has far exceeded my initial hopes.In the box: phone, headphones, usb charger, usb to wall converter, small manual, a shoddy case that doesn't let you use the side buttons of the phone and 2 screen protectors (1 already on the phone)."", ""Took a gamble at this Blu Product and I must say the following.build quality is nice better than expected.battery life was good also better than expected.WIFI wont turn on at all product came damaged which was sad since with smartphones you need internet.You cannot get 3G or 4G internet either which was shocking since it says it uses the 850MHZ bandSo I reported the problem to AMAZON customer service who were very friendly and professional and took care of my issue so I didn't feel robbed or like I would loose my hard earned money.since then I have still done business through amazon and things worked out ok.Assuming you get this phone working how it should I would say its a good buy, only gave 3 stars because mine came broken."", 'I\'ve had this phone for about a month now and I\'m satisfied with it. The screen is bright, the phone does not lag, and battery life is great. I do wish the camera took better photos though. The pictures can be a bit on the cool side and aren\'t terribly sharp. On T-Mobile\'s network, the phone jumps between HSPA and EDGE quite frequently, even in areas where I know HSPA to be readily available. Perhaps this has more to do with the fact that TMOB uses AWS (1700/2100) than it does with the phone itself, but I live in an area where TMOB has converted or ""refarmed"" their 3G to work on 1900 alone, so I feel like it should be more consistent than it is. I also was surprised to find that this phone has no compass sensor built in, so don\'t expect to be able to use any app that needs that functionality. Navigation apps still work quite well, however since the GPS signal can extrapolate your direction of travel when you are moving.All in all, this is a great phone for the price and I have no regrets having purchased it.', 'This Phone is no Joke, you can  buy with confidence It is 100% as stated  ... was told that i would get this phone on 3 Dec ... no it came on the 2nd, can t say enough about how pleased I am with this company.

I guess some will always pay the big bucks for the likes of Samsung and HTC. Blu has done a great job of coming up with smartphones that, in my opinion, are just as good as the ""big names"" on the market. Of course, this is an initial opinion which can change if the phone does not last for at least a year with minimal problems. This phone is quick and responsive. Could do with some more internal memory though. Oh, and in reference to what the Note can do that the Studio can\'t do, there\'s an app for that........ Thumbs up to Blu. Keep cranking them out guys, and keep them affordable. The camera if much better than some of the reviews suggest.... and no, I do not work for Blu.....didn\'t even know much about them until recently. I came to know more about the Blu phones because I became so fed up the the high prices of so called top smart phones. This is a great phone. I like it.', ""I would give this phone 5 stars but I cannot get 4G. I purchased the 5.3s  last year and I broke the screen. for the record.. best phone I ever owned. So I ordered, what I thought was the exact model and I recieved this model PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE read the fine print because there are two 5.3s models, one gets 4G and this one doesn't!!!!! I didnt not catch it until my return warranty expired so I'm stuck with this slow phone. What makes it worse is that I called BLU to figure out what the problem was and after 4 attempts with hold times of at least 2 hours each I gave up. I then looked at both of the original boxes the two phones came in and thats when I realized the difference. I'm dissapointed in myself for not catching this huge difference in the two phone but im even more dissapointed in the horrible advertisement on Amazon for this model phone. Now I have to buy yet another cell phone to meet my demands. I actualy pay for 4G and I havent gotten it since January... The ad should be a lot clearer or even have a different model name. Thanks Blu/Amazon for a sweet to bitter experience."", ""The phone is great, its nice and big and the screen is very bright and it has good viewing angles. the only problem with the phone is that there's no software updates, so you will be stuck with android 4.1.2 . also the lack of accessories for this is also somewhat of a disappointment, though i am not surprised either. The screen is very delicate on this phone like others, and this phone's screen cracked on my front pocket from my jeans and it is now unusable.

Here are some phone details-The screen is 540x960 pixels, compared to 480 x 800 of the Samsung Galaxy SIII mini-Using double SIM cards (you should check if your operators are compatible with the phone gsm/hspa bands) one SIM is only GSM, and the other is GSM, HSPA.  You can set up both cards to be on in standby mode and set default/always ask for voice calls / video calls / Messaging and Data Connection, also associate Contacts to a particular SIM-When connected by USB, the Phone Storage and the SD card are shown as mass storage devices, and not as a Media Device as some Samsung phones-Memory available for applications is 500 Mb, Phone Storage is 2 Gb.  With about 40 installed apps (Facebook the biggest one), and moving all enabled apps to the Phone Storage I Have about 120 Mb free app memory-The FM radio player allows sending the sound to speakers-The phone has a back cover with a waterproof ring for the battery, SIM and memory card area, as well as flaps to cover the micro usb port and the headphone jack. I have not made water inmersion tests.-Battery life with 3 days testing is mixed, with moderate use, one day the phone lasted the whole day, two days it barely made it.-This phone comes with a 1Amp AC USB charger, but it charges as well with other wall or car chargers which output 550mAh, some samsung phones wont charge with those lower capacity chargers.-Phone Camera gives good pictures with good light, it has a small flash ledOverall I am satisfied with this phone, good features and flexibility for the price.UPDATE JUNE 2013The phone keeps working fine, only two issues-There is a strange sound problem, when the phone is paired with a bluetooth car radio for phone audio (no media) and using Waze for car navigation, after a phone call is made or received, in some cases the phone sound stops working, there is a strange low frequency ""moan"" coming from the speaker.  Phone needs to be reset.-Available memory has become an issue, even after moving all possible apps to the sd card, using AppMgr III (app2sd), it is difficult to keep certain apps, just naming a few  (facebook, firefox, google+, flipboard, dropbox, chrome, hangouts) easily eat half the memory with the app, updates, data and cache, the new vine app uses 50 Mb just by itself.  below 50 Mb (10%?) a low storage warning appears and some services such as email stop working.  It has become difficult to keep the free memory and even test new apps.', ""The bad:No 3G Internet! This phone will not get 3G high speed data service (internet) in the US (only in Europe). Both T-Mobile and AT&T are widely on the 1900mhz band and this phone is 2100, which is mostly used in Europe. Blu has two separate models for the Tank 4.5 that work on the two different bands: W110i (this one) and W110a (the American version).I've had complaints about people having a hard time hearing me unless I keep the phone flat on my cheek. I am not sure if it is just my unit or they are all like this. Speaker phone is out of the question, no one can hear a thing I say.The Good:The phone works great, other than the voice problem above! It's interface and functionality are very smooth and useful. I have not tried it's water proof-ness, but it is nice to know there is protection from bad weather. GPS navigation and battery life have been great. I like the phone and the fact it can take two sim cards, but I just cannot work with 2G internet connection, and that is why I will be returning it.BOTTOM LINE:If you will be using the phone for simple tasks like navigation, talk, text, and occasional web, and you do not need the high speed access, then this is perfect!"", 'I really do like the phone and it operates just as advertised. In the end though, a stronger processor would have really made a difference. Putting in a 1.5 GHz dual-core is surely more expensive but I would have been willing to pay for that extra performance. Every app I have tried so far works smoothly but you do notice a difference in how fast apps are opened or, respectively, start. Launching the PONS dictionary app, for example, requires around 2+ seconds. On my old phone with a 1.2 GHz quad-core, the app was ready in under a second. But this is just a nice to have thing and of course comparing the performance for such a low priced phone with a quad-core operating one is not fair. So four stars for getting exactly what was promised. What also keeps it from getting five stars, is the fact that holding your finger on the toch screen actually results in a quivering of the running programme. For instance, the information bar you can drag down from the top is espically quavery while some apps scroll imprecisely. Furthermore, the wifi loses internet connection from time to time. The phone itself is still connected to the router, but no data from or to the internet is coming through. I could not figure out why or what to do against it. The only thing which helps is turning wifi off and on again.', ""This phone is good enough to do your everyday mobile activities and more. If you want extreme multitasking don't buy, instead pay $600 US and up for a smartphone. For $200 US you get the best bang for your buck on the market (new that is). I never exceed five programs opened simultaneously , games run smooth, apps work fine, volume is loud, it's dual sim and works like a charm. At first when I unintentionally pushed it to the extreme by opening programs after programs and it really freezed up but when I realized that it's 512 ram and dual core, then it hit me there is only so much multitasking you can do just like a computer with same specs. Not saying you can't multitask just not to the extreme because I multitask. Actually I bought two, one for my wife and one for me. The phone is not too large, battery is decent, takes good pictures, connection is great etc. I have not tested the water proof and dust proof yet but trust me it will be test because I don't baby up (treat delicate) my phones and it fell accidentally already, not a scratch. This is just my humble opinion as a user. Therefore if you're looking for extreme processing power go for a higher end smartphone but if you more simpler and just want to be able to take pictures, video record, play games, download apps, spend one third or even a quarter the the price of the best smartphones out there and you get an added bonus of dual sim unlock, go for this phone."", ""It's ok. Nothing special. About the same processing and RAM as a Galaxy S. However, it does have its quirks. You have to maintain a close eye on the internal storage vs. the phone storage and the SD card. Apparently the internal storage (500MB) is for app data and the app caches and will fill quickly giving an error for space requirements, despite having a phone storage capacity of 2 GB. All in all, while the product seems to work ok, I'll go for a Samsung next time."", ""I ignored other reviewers making this point and I regret it. This phone does not have enough internal storage. Also, if you don't need dual sim functionality it actually is quite annoying as it always asks you what sim you want to use even though you only have one.

I did some research before buying, but found nothing useful at the Blu website and other sites were somewhat misleading. In a nutshell, I wanted a dual-SIM, dual-Standby phone, able to receive calls on both lines concurrently. This phone CANNOT do that. If you are talking on line 1, and someone calls you on line 2 (or vice-versa), the second call will be dropped (or forwarded to mailbox, depending on your carrier\'s policy). I discovered that too late.The phone uses ""normal"" size sim cards, not the ""mini"" like the ones for the iPhones and other newer products.  Also, 3G/HSDPA is available only on SIM1. The SIM2 slot can only do 2G/EDGE.Pros:- The screen looks great. Black looks truly black and every color comes to life. The touch screen responsiveness is great too.- The dual-core processor does an excellent job. Everything runs smoothly.- Has enough RAM to run very demanding applications.- The main camera is very good at 8MP. The front-facing camera works nicely for video-chat.Cons:- No dual-standby- The headphone jack is low-quality. Anything you plug in there feels loose, and because of that, there is some noise at the headphones/speakers/whatever due to rotation/movement of the plug when you move the phone.- Specific accessories are still nonexistent (case, skins, screen protectors). By the way, I bought the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008CNHS2A case and it fits nicely (a little too tight in the beginning but fits well after some use).- The buzzer/loudspeaker is at the BACK of the phone. So, if you put your phone over a soft surface and try to use the speakerphone, the sound you hear will be muffled. That includes the ringer when the phone is in the case.I hope this review helps potential buyers. This is a very good deal for the price. This phone beats the Samsung Galaxy S3 and is much cheaper.', 'I am a low-maintenance person, so this phone lasted me three years--and might have kept going for many months more--except it just fell at the wrong angle which broke the screen. However, the headphone connection never worked well and was so bad that I never used it to listen to music or anything else by headphone. Secondly, despite trying various storage cards, the phone would never read them and thus kept me from utilizing more space than the basic GB that came with the phone. Finally, about one year in, it just refused to add new apps altogether, even if I deleted several to make space. This was a hassle when wifi connections required an app as part of the connection process, as is done at my university. Thus, I never got any apps that came out after 2014 and also never had wifi on campus, which was a major downfall. Also, as other reviewers mentioned, it was a real challenge to get the right phone accessories here in the US--it took at least 6 weeks being delivered from Asia which was a vulnerable time for the unprotected phone', ""I have received the phone and it really exceeded my expectations.I'm in Colombia and the goal was to have my voice plan with an operator (Claro) and data with the other (Tigo), for my voice operator and I just 2g and 3g for data and my first impressions are:From an intuitive way the phone is set to preset voice calls and messages on one line and the data on the other, so we will not be subject to choose sim whenever we make a trade.You have the option to choose between 2g and 3g networks, 2g to save battery and 3g when required to use stronger, version of android is very clean and without being charged with third-party applications such as computers, leaving many space for applications that wish to install, in terms of response speed and are excellent display with no problems so far.1.21 The dual core processor, the actual ram is 970.48 mb and has space in rom 1022.65 mg for applications, more than enough but if you want the copy on the sd, we have 1.92 GB available memory or the sd that we insert, in the particular case I have a 32 gb smoothly.Although the specifications say that the camera is 8 mp, 12 mp actually appears, but there is no option to change the resolution in the application predetermines whether third-party applications we can do.If it seems odd that the headphone jack is on the bottom but it is a matter of habit, I think the size and while it is lightweight plastic housing it seems sturdy.I used the hotspot option and it works perfect, the only thing is that it blocks incoming calls by voice line for some is good for others is wrong, it's a matter of taste.The battery life is very similar to other smartphones, turning it on at 6:30 am and with moderate use (chat, email, calls, etc ...) I got home at 7:00 pm and I have the 30% or 35%, and if used with video or something else runs faster.I was surprised FM radio sound is excellent and has the option to record broadcasts.The GPS works smoothly, I noticed even that is not lost both signal and other equipment and has met my requirements.So far I have not had problems with google play and applications, as other teams not very popular brands incompatibilities established, all I installed without problems.I tried to get accessories but are not options, especially silicone cases, but this case was http://www.amazon.com/Luxmo-Vertical-Leather-Holster-Carrying/dp/B008FQT28M and fits perfect.In short I think an excellent dual sim option, just as good as the big brands, it's more I decided that when it goes on sale the blu life, buy one to replace this.The Good:* Dual Sim option.* Good resolution camera.* Good response speed.* Android version very clean.* Excellent sound.* Low cost.The bad.* Block incoming calls when you can hotspot.* Low battery life (common to all smartphones).* Lack of third-party accessories or blu."", ""I would have given this baby a 5 stars if it wasn't for the battery life. It goes down at an incredible rate and definitely needs to be charged once a day if you're a heavy user.On the flip side this thing is well built, does anything that other smartphones can do, possibly more and it doesn't dry out my wallet.I think the camera images can be a bit better for an 8MP camera but maybe I just havent found the right app yet.Recently installed AVP the game, works fine. This phone ran about every I i threw at it thus far and i'm an appaholic :)UPDATE : 12th July 2013Still going strong. I still hate the battery life of this phone but the performance is outstanding.There isn't a person that I've shown this phone to that wasn't impressed and I'm not just saying that. I will definitely be buying another one for my spouse for the holidays."", 'I purchased this for international travel due to the dual sim card.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 that does not have a SIM slot so I needed to find an unlocked phone I could plug international sim cards into.  I researched the Blu models and chose this one because it was the only one I found with the super amoled screen.  I am very happy with this phone!  Legitimately, this phone is every bit as good as my Samsung Galaxy S3.  Aesthetically, it does not look quite as nice until you take into account how vivid the display is.  I tested this against my Samsung and it rendered web pages and You Tube videos faster.  In my quick casual testing this phone is faster than the Galaxy.The only drawbacks are the contacts application, text application and phone dialer are a little more old school looking and plain than something like a Samsung but you get over that quickly, the charger plugging into the top of the phone and the power button being on the left side of the phone are a bit awkward as well.  The battery does drain fairly quickly and is permanently fixed to the phone so cannot be removed and swapped out.  With a fair amount of usage I would think it will have to be charged to make it through the day.Other than the few drawbacks ..this is truly a beautiful phone with the vivid display and is a very well made and quality phone and is an excellent value the $200 price point.', 'From a non-tech savvy traveler.

Found the Vivo 4.3 and thought I'd give it a try. Here are the pros and cons of the phone is the default format. I know you can download themes, widgets, etc to change some of this stuff, but keep in mind I haven't done anything yet.Pros:- The screen is awesome. The color is great, the blacks are super dark, there are zero issues with viewing angles.- The phone is sturdy feeling despite feeling very light in the hand. I don't notice it in my pocket.- The speaker on the back is plenty loud. If you sit it flat on the back, it'll muffle the sound, but just lean it against something or hold it in your hand and you are good to go.- The phone boots up super fast and runs very smoothly. I haven't ran anything to intensive on the phone yet, but so far so good. AnTuTu benchmark scores it at 6467, if that matters to anyone. The performance for the money is more than fair with this phone.- Works with Straight TalkCons:- Screen resolution is tiny @ 480x728. Would like to see a few more pixels.- Speaking of screen space, the buttons are on the screen. This cuts off a little of the usable space on the screen. I would like to see dedicated keys below the screen because of the low resolution.- The power button is on the right side across from the volume keys. More often then not I'll hit them both when trying to shut the screen off. Pretty much every other phone I've used had the power button on the top right.- The home screen is on the far left of the 5 available screens. I would rather have the screen in the middle to cut back on scrolling since you can't scroll around to the left either.As mentioned earlier, the cons are very minimal for me. I can't really say how long the battery lasts because I keep a charger handy at both work and home. I've been very happy with the phone and would recommend it to anyone."", ""I bought this phone in February to replace an iPhone 3G which fell and got the screen broken. It is my first Android device, but there were a few things that really sold me on this phone. First the dual sim feature was the most important for me. I travel a lot and hate to have to carry two phones. Second was the size, 4.3 inches is much bigger than the iPhone but not as big as the Galaxy 3 which is 5 inches and I was not too fond of that size. Having the super amoled screen was the third thing and having Android 4.0 and now 4.1 sealed the deal for me. When I received the phone I was so surprised by how thin and light it was. When I turned it on I was blown away by how great the screen looked especially the blacks. I popped in a\xa0\nSanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-032G-U46A\n. I love the live wallpaper (wp clock) with the extra large clock display. Unlike how it is shown here the default background is black. It is very cool to me and I can see the time easily. I was changing various home screens and changed it by mistake but an email to BLU customer service was answered immediately. I asked them for the pdf manual which was not available on their website and they sent it for me also. Great response from them. Setting up the accounts such as gmail, whatsapp, magicjack and netflix plus facebook was easy. Typing is a breeze and I got all of the apps I was using on my iPhone from the play store and amazon app store for android. I live in Barbados and I did not want to review this phone until I had a chance to use it for the main feature for which I bought it ... The dual sim feature. I was in Vegas in April and the phone worked flawless. I had the LIME Barbados sim in the 3G slot and my AT&T sim in the 2G slot. I Have a T-Mobile 4G hotspot\xa0\nT-Mobile 4G Hotspot (T-Mobile)\n\xa0so I only need my AT&T for phone calls. When I arrived in the US, the AT&T service on sim 2 connected immediately. I had to make the phone manually search for a roaming network for the Barbados sim to connect to. It did not do this automatically like my iPhone so it had me there for a few minutes. It connected fine and you can set the phone to ask you which sim you want to use for each call. This worked fine and I just set it to use the AT&T by default. Next was the gps and google maps. I had my Garmin 1390T\xa0\nGarmin nüvi 1390/1390T 4.3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator with Traffic\n\xa0with me as well and the BLU was just as accurate as the Garmin plus you have voice search with the BLU. Call quality is great and loud and I changed the ringtone to one of my favorite songs. You have a ton of alert options and tones. I am an audio engineer and music is my life so the next thing I have to comment on is the audio of the phone. I bought Poweramp player because of the equalizer and the preamp functions. I have a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50\xa0\nAudio-Technica ATH-M50S Professional Studio Monitor Headphones\n\xa0headphones which my iPhone powered ok, but the BLU did not work well with these headphones. The BLU did drive my JVC Flats\xa0\nJVC HAS160B FLATS Lightweight Headband Headphones (Black)\n\xa0ok though. Definitely an impedance issue. My solution to this (serious problem for me) was the FiiO E07\xa0\nFiiO E07K Andes Portable USB DAC Headphone Amplifier, Black\n\xa0headphone amp and usb dac. This thing will knock the stuffing out of most headphones. Back to the phone. The good thing about Poweraamp is that when I was streaming my music via bluetooth to the stereo in my rental you have the 10 band eq and stereo width control to fine tune the sound. With bluetooth, wireless, both sims and the gps antennae on all of the time, the 1600 mah battery does not last all day. With wifi on only and medium or auto brightness, the battery gives me about seven and a half hours with normal use. I have a galaxy tab 2, 7 inch\xa0\nSamsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi)\n\xa0and with everything on the battery lasts forever. I have a PowerGen PGMPP12000 12000mAh External Battery Pack\xa0\nPowerGen PGMPP12000 12000mAh External Battery Pack High Capacity Power Bank Charger Triple USB 3Amps output for Apple iPhone 5 4s 4 3Gs 3G, iPod Touch, iPad 1 2 3 4, The New iPad 3/ HTC sensation, XE, XL, One X S V, Thunderbolt, Inspire 4G , EVO 3D, EVO...\n\xa0which keeps the BLU charged when on the go in a mall for example. For me, the battery life could be a bit better but for the money, this phone rocks. I have not had a problem with this phone that was not app related. For example, with the magicjack app installed and launched if you try to use voice search it will give you an audio error message. Just end the magicjack using a task killer (I use Android Task Killer) and the voice search will work again. I am just saying this because I read some of the other reviews and it may be operator error or lack of experience with the operating system, features of the phone and apps installed that may cause problems. Thousands of apps means thousands of software combinations which will cause the same device to operate differently for each user. Again I will say that this phone is terrific. I have purchased two more of these phones for my friends who have seen my phone and they are happy with them as well. A couple more things to mention. I am not a fan of phone cases but this is one of the biggest issues with the BLU VIVO 4.3 . There is no case available for the phone right now and this might be a big problem for some people who want to purchase the phone. BLU needs to work on this immediately. There must be some company that can make a case for it. When I plugged the phone into my mac, I see under system information that this device's vendor shows up as HTC. So the BLU is probably built for them by HTC which is a great thing. And yes, I purchase most of my stuff from Amazon.Update May 30th, 2013.I contacted BLU by phone and they emailed me the links for the Android 4.1.1 update for both the D910a and the D910i model of the phone. I followed the included instructions, backing up my user data first which took me about 10 minutes. I copied the file (update_BLU-D910a-V07-GENERIC_T8134.zip) to my SD card, rebooted into the utility mode and performed the update. When finished, make sure you do the factory reset as indicated in the instructions. I did not at first because I was not paying attention and the phone rebooted by itself. Everything worked except for my caller id which was really annoying. I checked with my friend that has a D910a and his update worked fine. So I rebooted into utility mode and did the factory reset. Of course you have to now re-link you accounts and setup stuff again. I actually chose not to restore my data. After owning the phone for a few months I wanted a few less apps, so I downloaded what I wanted again and re-linked my accounts and everything is working fine, including the caller id. Moral of the story, follow the makers instructions. I now also have Google Now and it is cool to ask the phone something and have it tell you the answer like Siri on the iPhone. Battery life has improved a bit as well. I hope they let us go to Android 4.2.x which will be the last version of the software to run on (non rooted) dual core devices so I heard. BLU Vivo 4.3 with Android 4.1.1 is fantastic."", ""This is my first smartphone, but I had an ipod touch before, so I have something to compare it with. So far I like it very much! It is really light and super fast! Every app that I've downloaded runs smoothly and the phone only crashed once when I tried to download a fake version of the iphone's siri. Anyway, I haven't had any hardware problems so far. The screen is huge and the keyboard is very good. The only reason I'll give this phone 4 stars is the touchscreen responsiveness, I know it sounds weird but the phone does not recognize my left index finger if the phone is lying flat on a surface no matter how hard I try. It is so weird but the ipod touch recognizes even the faintest touch so I don't know what's up.  I recommend the phone if you're willing to take some time to configure your android settings. The amount of functions and options the OS gives you can be a little overwhelming but that's good because you have control over most of your phone's capabilities.UPDATE: RETURNED THE PHONE BECAUSE OF TERRIBLE MICROPHONE. NOBODY COULD UNDERSTAND A SINGLE WORD I SAID. EVER. Asked for a replacement, same thing. the phone is great but the MAIN purpose is to be able to talk to people, and if it can't do that right, it's not worth buying no matter how many cool features it has."", ""This is an excellent phone but watch out for the build quality.I originally ordered one in mid-October as I was about to leave on an international trip and Verizons Intl roaming rates are ridiculous.  It worked out well a $7 SIM from Claro plus some airtime at 5 cents per minute in country and about 50 cents per minute to USA, no data,  but used the Wi-Fi at the hotel which worked great with this phone.I received it and was very pleased, here is what was most remarkable:1.  The large Super AmoLED display is awesome, blacks are truly black, video looks great, text is very readable, and it does not wash out in sunlight although it is tougher to see and read than in normal light.  I compared it under the same conditions to my iPod Touch 4,  I could not see anything in bright sunlight with the iPod where on this phone when taking a picture I could see the subject well enough.  The display alone alone is reason to buy this phone over other unlocked phones.  You have to go to high end Samsung at >$600 to get this same feature.2.  The Wi-Fi range is excellent and the Wireless signal quality seems quite good.  Tried it with both AT&T and Claro.3.  Has Android 4.0 which has many more features than Android 2.X which many inexpensive Android phones are still based on.  The web browser with Android 4.0 is much better than the one with Android 2.X.4.  All the misc sensors seem to work well, the accelerometer, the compass, the GPS, and the camera takes excellent picture and video although a bit noisy when it is a dark scene which is common for phone cameras.  Did have a problem here though see below.5.  Fast enough CPU.  It seems responsive in all apps I tried including 3D games.6. Is lightweight and just the right size so you can feel comfortable carrying it in your pocket all day.I did have two problems though with my first unit first the battery seemed to drain quickly and if I took a photo that needed the built-in flash the unit just shutdown.  After this shutdown I had to remove the battery to get it operating again.  This repeated the next time I took a flash photo a few days later while away and this time it was even harder to get back up.  Following this it would just shutdown for no obvious reason every few hours.  Tried full battery charge, airplane mode, etc and still problematic.  After returning from my trip I RMA'ed it as defective and quickly got the same model from Amazon.So far so good it is working great.  I can take flash photos with no problems and the battery drain appears nominal.As far as what you should expect for battery life with both a Wi-Fi signal and a wireless signal it drains the battery in about 2 days even if you only use it minimally.  To extend this disable one or the other radio except when needed and you will probably get 3-4 days.  Using the phone for light activity seems to draw the battery at about 10% per hour.  Talking is about the same.  Playing a 3D game draws the battery at about 20% per hour.  I am not sure if these numbers are good or bad it seems like everyone I know is charging there smart phones daily and this unit is no exception.Most people would remove a star or two for the problem I experienced with the initial phone but as an engineer I am aware that ALL electronic devices are subject to what is known as early failures, typically in the first few days of operation.  This occurs at a rate of 1-5% depending on component and build quality.  Used to be electronics were burned it at the manufacturer but no more it just costs too much to do even for the big (expensive) players.  The phone like most is made in China but to the specs of Blu (supposedly an American company based in Miami) so I think they should work on component and or build quality even if it raises the price by $20.Before I bought the phone I read the other reviews which were also generally positive.  The one reviewer mentioned a continuous repetitive background sound when using headphones, good sound was important to me as I use it as a music player also.  Soon after getting it I tried it with three sets of headphones and no such issue.  Again being an engineer this is typically caused by a bad capacitor in the audio output section allowing internal electrical noise to come though.  To the other reviewer who had this problem just RMA the phone and get a new one.  It is another example of a build quality issue and is not endemic of the phones design.So BOTTOM LINE THIS IS A GREAT PHONE for the price.  If you purchase this phone though try out all the device features, camera with flash, other sensors, and try it with headphones as soon as you get it and if anything does not work right or causes a shutdown or other issues just RMA it and hopefully the next one will be fine.  This is a nice advantage of using Amazon they do not give you hassles about returns or try to convince you a problem is not really a problem.  This is particularly important in light of other reviewers (no personal experience) reporting that Blu has poor customer support.  Hopefully they will improve this.BTW: There is no form fit case at this time for the phone.  To protect it I bought a small thin lightly padded camera case at Sears that fit it well.  Other small camera cases may also work but you have to try them so it makes it hard to order one online, like Shoes.  This case is less convenient as when I get a call as it takes 10 seconds to get it out of the case but is better than nothing.  Hopefully Blu will work with a case vendor or two to create a form fit case in the coming weeks and post on there web site the make and model of the case options."", ""There are one or two negative reviews that gave me pause, but I went ahead and took the plunge. I've had this phone for just over a week now. Since I've owned a samsung galaxy tab 7.7 for just under a year, I'm quite familiar with high end android products and the super Amoled screen. Lets take my experience with the CONS other reviewers have mentioned. Voice quality:  Not a problem. I'm sure there are phones with better voice quality out there, but I don't believe I've encountered many. If you say something clearly (without shouting), the other person will hear you. fullstop. Thats all I really need to make and receive calls effectively.  Slippery surface:  Rubbish. The plastic back has a quality feel to it but is by no means shiny or slippery.  No cases sold for it:  That's definitely a problem for most. I just use one of those belt clipped cases, but I have no protective sleeve or case for the instrument itself.  Screen:  Colours are gorgeous. But screen resolution is not as good as the high-end Samsung Galaxy SIII or iphone 4s and up.  Volume rocker position:  it is on the left, right across from the standby/on button. NOt a problem for me. It depends on what one is used to, and how adaptable one is. Battery life:  Good. IF you remove the obnoxious live wall paper that it comes with and you put an app killer program on it. Don't forget to adjust the backlighting to either low, or automatic.  This phone looks, feels and performs like a proper welll built android device. It serfs the net nicely and dual sim is nice. I'm quite happy."", ""I have had this phone for about 3 weeks and everything on it is what to be expected.  Ok, the battery life is not great, but if you are looking for that in a phone, you probably should go with the new razors.  Another thing is that I can't find accessories to fit this phone.  I have searched Amazon and also called the company that delivered the phone and they said that they don't deal with accessories.  I was hoping to get another battery since the life on this one is not great but what are you going to do?  The battery for me lasts all day, but I'm not streaming or checking facebook a million times a day.  The battery life can be extended by having the auto brightness enabled.  The phone is responsive and works well with the StraightTalk plan I purchased.  I did have to tweak the internet settings to get picture messaging to work but after that no problems.  This phone is good for a general phone user, not one who is a electronic genius.  I am not worried about the UI or putting code into the phone or rooting it.  I browse the internet, make calls, and texts and I have had no problems with that when I got everything set up for my phone account.BOTTOM LINE:IF you are a general user you will like the phone and what is has to offer for the price.IF you are a tech savy person, you will have a new phone in 3 weeks anyway so don't bother getting this one.Great phone for the price and like it alot except for the the two things I mentioned earlier."", ""I really enjoy having this phone.  It is sophisticated, having some very desirable features.  The Android 4.0 is a big improvement.  The pull down controls are super handy.  It allows for some quick changes like turning on/off wifi, data, screen brightness, rotation and some others.  I like that a lot.  The large screen is bright, clear and sharp.  Touch response is excellent.  Buttons controls are solid and the camera is excellent.The down side.Sound jack: Does not work with any quality headphones.  The sound is tinny and distant. Use a low end stereo headset without mic and it sounds fine.  Also, the primary reason for me to switch from a dumb phone to smart was the use of the Square card reader.  Total disappointment because it will not work.  My readers, both, will work on my iPad.Set up.  Being not tied to any carrier, the data/mms setting were all wrong.  When I first plugged my sim card in, phone worked but no data, no mms.  Searched online for APN setting and it took a little while to find the correct ones.  (Don't bother asking AT&T for help, they either don't know or they're playing dumb.Ending on a happy note: The simple tethering/mobile wifi setup.  No need to pay for high end data plans that's required for tethering.  I use a minimum prepaid plan for data and I am able to tether my iPad to my phone.  Nice!It's worth it.  My boss keeps asking how much I paid for this phone.  Curious to know if he's going to get one for himself."", 'OK, many things have been told abour Blu products, however after a LONG wait I\'ve recieved my Vivo 4.3.I used to have a Samsung Galaxy SII, great phone, very useful, but due to business (I travel around the world very often) it\'s very important to me to have a dual simm phone for not to carry two phones.I looked for chinesse dual simm phones, but the most of them are cr@p, very cheap, but very low quality.Then I looked for a ""branded"" dual simm phone, and I found a Galaxy Y DUOS, good as all the samsung phones, however I needed more ""power"" in processor and a bigger screen, I use a lot the GPS and the screen and the processor of the Galaxy Y DUOS were a little ""awful"". I also use the phone for watching videos while traveling and the 240 x 320 pixels, 3.14 inches screen didn\'t help a lot.I found Blu company in one travel to Miami, I looked to their phones and I was about to buy the Blu Studio 5.3 but the reviews stoped me from doing that, the processor wasn\'t good and the screen resolution was not what you would spect from such a big phone.Then I read about the Vivo 4.3 specifications, and I really wanted to have one of them because the super amoled 4.3 480x800 screen, and the 1GHZ dual core processor.I recieved mine two weeks ago, and I\'m really really happy with it, when unpacked is about the same size of the Samsung Galaxy SII, but lighter even with the battery installed, when turned on the screen responds fast and run the most of the apps almost inmediatly.I installed a 32 Gbytes micro SD and the phone went to its full potential.I downloaded Waze social navigator and NDrive GPS app and tested both, the response is FAST, just the way it should be when you are driving.Simm 1 carries the 3G, Simm 2 carries 2G only, so when I\'m in my country (Mexico) my first simm is the local carrier (Telcel) when I\'m abroad I switch the simm for the local carrier, I was in USA last week and used a H20 simm card for data and voice and worked as spected.Next week I\'ll go to Europe and I will try it with Movistar in Spain and Orange in France, I will let you know how it goes.What I didn\'t like was the horrible start screen, and the theme that Blu is using in the interface, I found it very anoying. However I installed SPB Mobile Shell and the experience was much much better.I\'m strugling with the phone ring tones, but I\'m sure I will find how to change them soon.I\'m happy with the phone, so far I haven\'t found any thing that dislike me.My advice..... because of the price and the performance.... get your Vivo 4.3, you will not regret.,', 'Good for teenagers first phone', 'This phone will have 5 stars out of me for all the good reasons mentioned in the other reviews and especially the price!!!! But, I\'m hoping this isn\'t a case of ""you get what you paid for"" because I personally, would not like to pay over $250 for a good unlocked smart phone.Any way, the missing 4th and 5th star is from the battery life and charge rate...Testing both me and my wife\'s phone, charge rate is aprox 5% per 10min on the charge. I\'m going to start the process of taking it back and getting another to see if that will do the trick, if so I\'ll bump it up to 5 stars...If not I\'ll leave bump it down to 2 stars because I\'ll be doing a full refund return and settling on a least spec\'ed phone....Really hope the battery life is fixed once I get it back from amazon...We\'ll see and I\'ll keep you all updated..BTW if anyone finds a comparable phone i\'m mainly looking for:front facing cameraat least 5gbos at android 4.0 ice cream sandwich. kind of don\'t want to go above 4.0 since there isn\'t support for flash anymore....']"
