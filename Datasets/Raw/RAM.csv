I can edit music, images and videos and the occasional gaming with no problem whatsoever, everything runs smoothly!"", ""upgraded my computer's memory with two sticks of RAM, and it has significantly improved my system's performance. Below, I will outline the pros and cons of these RAM sticks based on my personal experience:Pros:  Impressive 32GB Capacity: The inclusion of two 16GB RAM sticks has provided a substantial boost to my computer's memory capacity. With a total of 32GB, I can comfortably run memory-intensive applications, multitask effortlessly, and handle demanding tasks such as video editing, 3D rendering, and gaming without experiencing any slowdowns.  Aesthetic Enhancement for an All White Build: These RAM sticks perfectly complemented my all white computer build, adding a touch of elegance and sophistication to the overall aesthetics. The clean and sleek design effortlessly integrates with the color scheme, creating a visually appealing setup.  Vibrant and Eye-Catching Colors: The vibrant colors of the RAM sticks enhance the visual appeal of the interior components. Whether it's the heat spreaders or the LED lighting, the colors add a dynamic and captivating element to the overall look of the system. It's a delightful sight that adds personality to the build.  Easy Installation: Installing these RAM sticks was a breeze. The sticks fit seamlessly into the RAM slots on my motherboard, and the installation process was straightforward. The user-friendly design ensures that even those with limited technical knowledge can successfully upgrade their system's memory.Cons:  Higher Price Tag: While these RAM sticks offer excellent performance and aesthetic appeal, they may not be the most budget-friendly option on the market. The advanced features, larger capacity, and eye-catching design contribute to a higher price point compared to more basic RAM options. However, the enhanced performance and visual impact may justify the investment for those seeking a high-quality and visually pleasing upgrade.In summary, the two sticks of RAM provide a substantial boost to your computer's memory capacity, allowing for smooth multitasking and seamless performance, especially for resource-intensive tasks. The stylish design and vibrant colors enhance the visual appeal of your system, particularly in an all white build. The easy installation process ensures a hassle-free upgrade experience. However, it's worth noting that these RAM sticks come with a higher price tag compared to more basic options. If you prioritize performance, aesthetics, and are willing to invest in a premium RAM upgrade, these sticks are a fantastic choice for taking your system to the next level.""]"

I attempted to return the product and work with both Amazon and Crucial customer service, but was met with unhelpful and slow responses. I ultimately had to waste time and money finding a solution to the issue. I would not recommend this product or the buying experience through Amazon.', 'I recently purchased a Dell XPS 15 9520 in early May and it only had 16gb but since RAM is literally one of the easiest things to install yourself I never pay extra for the ""upgraded"" ram from Dell or any other manufacturer and just install it myself at literally about 1/3 of the cost Dell, HP, Alienware, etc want to charge you for it.  Anyway, I build desktop PCs for folks, run a couple media servers, and have personally owned and used laptops myself since the late 90s.  Again, adding some extra ram was always an easy proposition - the worst part being prying off the bottom of the laptop and not breaking the plastic or scratching the edges etc.  Once installed, you\'d just power it back on. There would be a slightly longer delay to boot up than usual for the first boot after the upgrade but then everything would be fine. I\'ve done it countless times for laptops and desktops alike....but this Dell is different.  I did two upgrades at the same time this go \'round for my laptop. I had upgraded from a 1tb sky hynix nvme that came stock to a 990 Pro 2tb and also bumped up from 16gb ram to 64gb.  I installed both at the same time...turned the pc back on and, the Dell boot logo pops up like normal and then.....nothing....it just sits there....and sits there some more.  5 minutes pass...nothing...just a static boot logo on the screen. I assumed the cloned drive was likely the culprit and swapped back the original drive first and turned it back on...same thing...just the boot logo would pop up.  So i tried putting back in the stock ram and voila...booted normal again.  Swapped out for the 990 pro and left the stock RAM back in and once again just a static Dell boot logo for 5 minutes with no signs of anything changing so I thought the issue was definitely the RAM was incompatible for some reason and I was getting ready to return it when I started googling some more about this laptop. I already knew it\'s notorious for not taking ram from corsair or kingston for some reason but from everything I had read this Crucial ram worked fine as an upgrade.  Eventually, after getting lost in so many threads with people struggling to upgrade RAM on this laptop I came across a reddit thread with people saying even the Crucial ram was giving them issues but thankfully one person said you literally have to wait a LONG time for it to recognize the new amount of RAM.  This person said you have to let it sit on that Dell boot logo for at least 20 minutes before it will finally recognize there\'s some new RAM installed.  So I put the Crucial ram back in...booted to that static Dell logo and waited...and waited...about 25 minutes later it finally pops up with a new screen saying ""the amount of memory detected has changed. press ok to continue"".  I pressed ok and it restarted and went straight into the OS like normal lol.So, long story short.  it DOES work but the laptop makes it seem like it\'s not working. I\'ve NEVER seen a PC take THAT long to reconize new ram installed but this one does so if you own this lovely laptop please be advised this is normal and just let it sit there and do it\'s thing for about 25 minutes.  It\'ll work...eventually lol.  So far I haven\'t had any additional issues with slow boot times. The whole booting to OS process only takes around 7-10 seconds now like it should.  Fantastic savings over buying the Dell ram.  64gb of Dell ram is close to $500 currently. I got this 32gbx2 kit on Prime Day for $130.  MASSIVE savings. In fact I was able to get the 990 PRO 2tb nvme and this kit and STILL save almost $250 total versus just what Dell wants for the ram kit.', ""Tutto bene anche se Amazon spedisce senza nessuna protezione ESD!

De modo que si tu ordenador no tiene XMP activado, no permite activarlo y/o no permite configurar el overclocking, ni pienses en comprarlas, pues estar√°s pagando por 3200MHz y recibiendo solo 2666MHz. Es decir que estar√°s probablemente desperdiciando dinero.Ya me parec√≠a raro que estuvieran m√°s baratas que la mayor√≠a. Pero eso lo explica. Para comenzar, funcionan con XMP, con que cuestan menos que las que andan directamente. Y luego el hecho de que no me han funcionado bien, con lo que oigo la voz de mi abuelo: lo barato sale caro!Y es que el punto, la raz√≥n por la que las compr√©, fue que para ser un kit de 64Gb @ 3200MHz est√° al menos 100 m√°s barato que otros. Pero no le√≠ en ninguna parte que fuera XMP. Las compr√© para la HP OMEN 15-en0003ns y lamentablemente, a estas alturas, y a pesar de ser un ordenador para gaming, a√∫n no tiene soporte de XMP u overclocking. En fin, solo ha sido luego de investigar en l√≠nea que me di cuenta que para conseguir los 3200MHz de este RAM tendr√≠a que tener acceso a algo que mi ordenador no tiene acceso. Pero debo mencionar que esta es la memoria que me fue recomendada para mi modelo espec√≠fico de ordenador en la misma p√°gina de Crucial. Luego el soporte de Crucial me confirma que esta memoria requiere de XMP y que mi ordenador no lo tiene; de modo que recomiendan ellos mismos una memoria que saben que no va andar correctamente.El RAM original de mi Omen es de 16Gb (2x8GB) y anda correctamente a 3200MHz porque es de Samsung y, entonces, plug-n-play. Es m√°s, al realizar una prueba de benchmark me sale como ‚Äú103% Outstanding‚Äù, que quiere decir Sobresaliente; y ‚ÄúPerforming way above expectations (94th percentile)‚Äù que quiere decir que anda mucho mejor de lo que se espera de esa memoria y que est√° en el percentil 94. Con lo que solo 6% de memorias similares funcionan mejor que la m√≠a. En general, con la memoria original instalada el benchmark me dice que mi Omen est√° en el percentil 48% para gaming, el 95% como ordenador de escritorio y el 48% como m√°quina de trabajo; y que ‚ÄúEn general, esta PC est√° funcionando por encima de las expectativas (percentil 75). Esto significa que de 100 PC con exactamente los mismos componentes, 25 funcionaron mejor.‚ÄùSin embargo, le pongo estas RAM de 64Gb y directamente baja a 2667Mhz, me dice que es ‚Äúdesconocido‚Äù y que son 2x31.5GB (y no 2x32Gb). Me dice que su performance est√° en ‚Äú69.8% Good‚Äù, es decir Buena‚Ä¶ y ‚ÄúPerforming way below expectations (4th percentile)‚Äù, que quiere decir que anda MUY POR DEBAJO de las expectativas, y que est√° en el 4to percentil‚Ä¶ es decir que el 96% de memorias andan mejor! Y en general ahora coloca mi Omen a 41% para gaming, 87% como ordenador de escritorio y 41% como ordenador de trabajo. Y me dice: ‚ÄúEn general, esta PC se est√° desempe√±ando por debajo de las expectativas (percentil 39). Esto significa que de 100 PC con exactamente los mismos componentes, 61 funcionaron mejor. El percentil general de PC es el promedio de cada uno de sus componentes individuales. Utilice los gr√°ficos de las secciones de referencia de este informe para identificar las √°reas problem√°ticas.‚Äù (Y el √°rea problem√°tica es la memoria, obviamente, pues todo el resto funciona como antes.)De modo que ya ves que 350‚Ç¨ me ha costado retroceder mi ordenador a un estado peor del que estaba inicialmente! Obviamente que no me iba a quedar con las memorias‚Ä¶Pero igual decid√≠ hacer otras pruebas y, adem√°s, ver si es que hab√≠a alguna manera de ponerlas a la altura que deber√≠an estar.En t√©rminos de mis pruebas con lo que trabajo a diario, que es la edici√≥n de v√≠deo y post-producci√≥n, los resultados en t√©rminos de render y exportaci√≥n fueron iguales que antes. No me esperaba que fuera un cambio muy dram√°tico, pues estas cosas m√°s tienen que ver con CPU y GPU, pero s√≠ que me esperaba alg√∫n cambio, as√≠ sea ligero, para mejor. En el mejor de los casos, los tiempos se mantuvieron iguales; pero cuando cambiaron, fue para INCREMENTAR y no reducir. As√≠ fue que not√© que en exportaci√≥n de 3D est√° un 3% m√°s lenta y que en exportaci√≥n de Premiere Pro est√° entre 9-10% m√°s lenta. En After Effects y dem√°s, el tiempo se mantuvo igual.Ya es suficiente para que yo sepa que no vale la pena la inversi√≥n de 350‚Ç¨, pues yo necesito al menos alguna mejora en t√©rminos de velocidad en estas aplicaciones. No obstante, ni siquiera en aspectos que no dependen del GPU/CPU mejor√≥ en velocidad: las aplicaciones demoran igual en abrir y estar listas para usar (incluso not√© que el After Effects demoraba m√°s), el uso de las mismas no es m√°s r√°pido (incluso el Playback se mantuvo pr√°cticamente como antes), etc.Y en t√©rminos subjetivos, es decir, en lo que pude percibir al usar el ordenador, navegar por √©l, abrir otras aplicaciones como Word o Chrome, al abrir carpetas, etc., no not√© ninguna diferencia! Si not√© algo, he sentido que fue para mal‚Ä¶ espec√≠ficamente cuando se trata de acceder a mi disco externo de 8Tb WD MyBook: not√© que demoraba m√°s en cargar proyectos que estaban archivados ah√≠. Adem√°s, he sentido que el Windows 10 me carga a la misma velocidad.Entonces me comuniqu√© con Crucial directamente y les coment√© todo lo que aqu√≠ les comento a ustedes‚Ä¶ Su respuesta no tom√≥ en cuenta los tests de benchmark o mis pruebas con los programas de edici√≥n que uso, sino se enfoc√≥ en que el Windows no carga m√°s r√°pido y culp√≥ al BIOS, al Windows y a mis drivers, que hab√≠a que mantener todos actualizados; culp√≥ al hardware de mi ordenador, que hab√≠a que hacer tests de que no estuviera da√±ado; y culp√≥ a mi disco r√≠gido‚Ä¶ Les expliqu√© que hace una semana realic√© tests completos (que los hago cada cierto tiempo) y que todo estaba andando al 100%; que todo estaba completamente actualizado, incluyendo el BIOS; y que nada hab√≠a cambiado en mi ordenador, excepto las memorias RAM! Y que antes de colocarlas todo andaba perfectamente, de modo que c√≥mo pod√≠a ser culpa de otra cosa que no fuera la √∫nica variable: las memorias! Siguieron empecinados en lo mismo y, pues, como yo no quiero perder mi tiempo, con eso me decid√≠ a devolver las memorias inmediatamente y regresar a como estaba antes‚Ä¶ y esperar a ahorrar un poco m√°s para invertir en unas RAM de una marca que s√≠ conozca.Ahora, incluso si se dieran los problemas que alega Crucial, no hay manera que con 4 veces la velocidad RAM no haya siquiera una m√≠nima mejor√≠a‚Ä¶ Eso me parece imposible.Ahora que estoy de vuelta con mi m√≠sero RAM de 16Gb vuelvo a tener los resultados sobresalientes que mencion√© al principio, mi ordenador anda igual y, en el mejor de los casos, me parece que en general anda mejor que con las de Crucial.Ser√≠a f√°cil adjudicar los problemas al hecho de e que en vez de andar a 3200MHz las Crucial andan a 2667MHz en mi ordenador, pero la verdad que la diferencia en esa velocidad deber√≠a ser m√≠nima en la mayor√≠a de usos, sobre todo en los que a m√≠ me interesan. Y luego est√° el hecho de que incluso andando m√°s lento en esos t√©rminos, el hecho de que hablamos de 48Gb m√°s, es decir de 4 veces la capacidad RAM, como digo arriba en el peor de los casos absolutamente tendr√≠a que haber al menos una m√≠nima mejor√≠a en velocidad‚Ä¶ y no la hubo.', 'Las uso para un port√°til gaming y hasta ahora no he tenido ning√∫n problema con ellas, funcionan genial y en resumidas es lo que indica el propio producto', ""So I want to begin with the Intel XMP preset settings. It does appear that it's more likely required to select the profile in the bios with a good cold restart before you actually see the results. Other than that test. This is the ultimate generic product. The hard posted sticker on the product picture and description is nothing more than just a plastic sticker. This is not exactly a problem. I already reconsidered the amount of cooling and just plain cool accessories for the mobile platform the list goes all the way down to none and never will be required. There is no room for extra plates. This ram is of course goes great with the Intel NUC6i7KYK kit. And it is pretty much doing everything as expected with just the basic destinations as a personal media computer that does other network jobs. The list is very simple network storage, remote host and virtual machine host. And it actually can do more than expected as a single working computer. What I can show right now is only just the basic benchmark performance that's used 24/7. And with the kit package I only get better performance. The speed is great at 3200mhz and never really changes. It comepletly changed the freezing problems for the kit aswell, in my opinion. I never really had problems filling up the most possible ram in the computer with any technical issues. The computer always accepted more than indicated by the CPU specifications. And I would go with the maximum of 64gb. I just considered the value and the every day use for the 32gb kit. I have seen a performance boost and quality in contrast to store product quality, but I unfortunatelly do not have any benchmark copies left. All I can say is that the limit reached is pretty much the same as raced. It recieved a very high score as is without any unrequired CPU clock changes. As always I don't like the undesired settings to bolster the loose ends, it's just a package that works after the finally good research for this weird compatibility blame."", 'Upgraded a new Asus TUF506IV from stock 8GB 3200MHz CL22.  The Crucial 64GB memory installed easily, system PassMark rating was 4575 (compared to original 4490), and MemTest86 ran 8-10 hours with no errors.  Sounds good, but on my non-XMP system it runs at its (non-advertised) JEDEC speed of 2666MHz CL20.  So it is indeed solid, reliable memory from a trusted vendor, and increased my system\'s memory by 4x at no speed loss.However, another vendor\'s product advertised JEDEC (not XMP) speeds of 3200MHz CL18 for a similar price.  First shipment failed MemTest86 in the first hour.  Replacement passed MemTest86 11+ hours and is now running at advertised speed, which lowers latency from stock CL22 to CL18.  PassMark now scores 4793 (vs 4575).My greatest disappointment is that a brand I trusted, Crucial, was not upfront about the need for XMP to achieve advertised speed.  Maybe it\'s my own stupidity, but not everyone knows about that subtle difference between interchangeable XMP 1.35V and JEDEC 1.2V products.  Their product support folks defend their website assertion that ""it\'s compatible"" with my system, by noting that it does indeed run and is reliable, just slower.I don\'t know if a 300-point PassMark difference matters (not much), or if the speed difference matters, I\'m just put out that I only became aware of the issue (due to my ignorance about XMP/JEDEC speed variances) after my purchase, and it complicated a simple upgrade with some hours of additional research and support calls while the product was already on the way.Score:  When first Crucial shipment arrived, bag was empty (improperly sealed); Amazon replaced no problem, second set worked well, though slower than expected.  First ""other brand"" shipment failed testing; Amazon replaced no problem, second set worked well and at expected speeds, and it\'s running  in my system now.Help us understand, Crucial.  You\'ve been trusted for years.  Saying up front that ""in non-XMP systems the memory will revert to JEDEC speeds"", or even saying ""XMP>3200, JEDEC>2666"" somewhere would\'ve helped.']"

Great RAM brand and love the RGB lighting!', 'Avevo necessit√† di upgradare il mio computer da 16 a 32Gb di RAM, e di questi tempi, per le DDR4, non c\'√® pi√π tanta differenza in fatto di prezzo nelle combinazioni di velocit√† e latenze pi√π comuni, e i banchi con RGB spesso si trovano a meno di 10 euro in pi√π rispetto ai banchi ""lisci"", almeno per quanto riguarda queste ram da gaming col dissipatore figo. Prima avevo le Kingston Fury bianche che vedete nella foto, 16Gb, con timings 3200 CL16. Queste sono la versione ""SL"" delle Vengeance RGB, leggermente pi√π basse delle RGB non ""SL"", che arrivano a circa 5CM di altezza contro i 4.5Cm di queste (che comunque sono parecchio alte e infatti sul mio PC toccano i tubi dell\'AIO), ma per il resto sono pressoch√© identiche. Nella foto vedete la differenza tra questa, le Kingston Fury, e un banco di ram OEM.In ogni caso, oramai le uniche combinazioni di latenza e velocit√† che vale la pena comprare sono o queste da 3600 CL18, o le 3200 CL16. Non sto a scrivere una tesi ingegneristica su come funzionano le latenze delle RAM, sappiate solo che tra queste due combinazioni di velocit√† e latenza, la latenza effettiva della memoria √® sostanzialmente la stessa (infatti non noto nessuna differenza, ma proprio zero, tra le Kingston 3200CL16 e queste 3600CL18).Generalmente le 3600CL18 costano un po\' di pi√π perch√© hanno un po\' pi√π margine di overclock (o possono essere portate a clock pi√π bassi con latenza pi√π bassa come per esempio 3200 CL14, migliorando la latenza assoluta). Per me non ne vale la pena, preferisco giocare ai videogiochi piuttosto che passare i giorni a settare timings e voltaggi a mano per un miglioramento nei benchmark statici dell\'1%, magari per poi trovarmi con il sistema instabile all\'improvviso dopo un mese di apparente stabilit√†.Nel mio caso poi, che ho un processore 5800X3D, la cache L3 di 96Mb del processore rende pressoch√© nullo qualsiasi guadagno si possa ottenere da RAM pi√π veloci, in quanto specialmente nel gaming tutto ci√≤ che serve al processore √® caricato nella cache L3, le letture dirette dalla RAM diventano quindi meno frequenti. In altre parole, la velocit√† delle RAM passa totalmente in secondo piano.Oltre a questo, generalmente su tutti i banchi di RAM la base (JEDEC) √® la stessa, ovvero 2133 CL15. Poi dal bios si imposta il profilo XMP o DOCP, che √® salvato in modo permanente nel banco di RAM dal produttore e contiene tutti i timings, voltaggi e quant\'altro per farle andare alla velocit√† che avete pagato e che √® scritta sulla scatola. La differenza fisica quindi tra una 3200 CL16 e una 4000 CL20 √® inesistente perch√© il JEDEC √® lo stesso, prendendo RAM pi√π veloci andrete a pagare il fatto che il produttore ha testato il banco con velocit√† pi√π spinte e l\'ha certificato inserendolo nel profilo XMP. E tutto questo per cosa? Magari andrete a pagare il 50% in pi√π di prezzo per un incremento prestazionale STATICO del 1-5% nel migliore dei casi (e dello 0.x% nel gaming specialmente se avete un processore come il mio). Direi quindi che se la matematica non mi inganna, pagare il 50% in pi√π per un incremento prestazionale dell\'1-5% non vale la pena!Quindi perch√© ho preso le 3600CL18?Perch√© le ho prese usate con Amazon Seconda Mano e costavano meno delle 3200CL16. Ed √® quello che consiglio a chiunque, prendete quelle che costano meno, se non fate overclock estremo per il gusto di farlo, ve ne potete altamente fregare di queste faccende, e vi prego, state lontani da qualsiasi banco di ram che non sia una delle due combinazioni citate sopra, ovvero 3600 CL18 e 3200 CL16, andreste a pagare magari il 50% in pi√π per un incremento nelle prestazioni STATICHE di 1-5% se va bene e letteralmente zero nel gaming.Bene, abbiamo appurato che dei timing e della velocit√† ce ne possiamo altamente fregare, quindi parliamo di cose SERIE, di quello che interessa davvero a noi GAMERS, ovvero di lucine colorate.Ognuna di queste ha ben 10 leddini RGB personalizzabili. Se come nel mio caso avete tutto della NZXT, e che quindi state gi√† usando l\'odiatissimo NZXT-CAM per controllare i vari leddini che avete in giro sparsi nel case, per controllare queste dovrete installare Corsair iCUE, che √® uno dei peggiori abomini software che io abbia mai visto. √à talmente un abominio che in confronto ad iCUE quella mostruosit√† che √® l\'Asus Armoury Crate sembra quasi accettabile.Vi dico solo che iCue √® un download da 1.5Gb, che una volta installato occupa 3.5Gb su disco. E io mi chiedo, ma veramente servono 3.5Gb di dati non meglio identificati per controllare 10 leddini su delle RAM? Bloatware allo stato puro.In ogni caso, per quanto mi faccia schifo iCue, c\'√® una buona notizia che mi permette di conferire a queste RAM l\'ambito premio di ""miglior RAM RGB"". Al contrario delle Kingston, queste potete programmarle una volta con iCue e poi disinstallarlo per sempre, e le RAM manterranno il profilo che avrete impostato a vita! Baster√† andare su ""impostazioni hardware"" dentro iCue, impostare i colori o l\'effetto psichedelico che pi√π si addice alla vostra cameretta, et voila, potrete disinstallare iCue per sempre, riavviare il computer, fare il boot in Linux, installare le RAM in un nuovo computer, saranno sempre illuminate con le impostazioni che avete scelto dentro iCue la prima volta.Non come le Kingston Fury che ad ogni avvio ritornano in modalit√† arcobaleno epilettico e non riprendono le impostazioni finch√© non caricherete Windows e il relativo servizio in background che le imposta. Poi ok, le Kingston si programmano tramite un tool di pochi Mb, che usa un servizio che gira in background in Windows anche lui che occupa una decina di Mb in RAM, molto molto meglio di iCue e i suoi 3.5Gb su disco di chiss√† cosa, ma comunque, non avere nulla che gira in background e il profilo che rimane direttamente memorizzato nell\'hardware √® sempre e comunque preferibile.Solo per questo, fermo restando che dei timings e delle velocit√† ce ne possiamo sbattere, le posso consigliare rispetto alle Kingston Fury.Un\'ultima cosa interessante di queste che ho notato, √® che hanno il sensore della temperatura. Quando le ho testate con Memtest86 per verificare che non fossero state rivendute difettate da Amazon Seconda Mano (perch√© fidarsi √® bene, non fidarsi √® meglio), anche la temperatura era visualizzata, prima volta nella mia vita che vedo delle RAM con sensore di temperatura attivo e funzionante. Molto bello peccato che non serve a nulla, perch√© anche dopo 4 ore intense di martellamenti da parte di Memtest86, la temperatura ha variato dai 30 ai 35C senza mai eccedere i 40. Ampiamente entro le raccomandazioni di utilizzo del produttore.Per concludere, sono delle normali RAM ""da gaming"" col dissipatore, che fanno il loro lavoro e si illuminano con effetti carini. I timings e le frequenze sono nella norma per il 99.9% degli utilizzi. Se vi interessano i led, queste o la variante 3200CL16 sono le migliori per il semplice fatto che le potrete impostare una volta e poi disinstallare l\'odioso software di Corsair per sempre (cosa che non si pu√≤ fare con le Kingston Fury). Le consiglio senza riserve, specialmente se le trovate allo stesso prezzo o meno rispetto ad altre, in generale comprate quelle che costano meno.', ""La Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro SL 32 Go est absolument exceptionnelle en mati√®re de performance et d'esth√©tique.

Ive found that 16GB just isnt quite enough to run well for all of what I want to do at once on my system. I just kind of auto-specced the old sticks, and it turned out to run at 3200Mhz CL22, which is not great.All I needed to do was shove the two sticks in the #2 slots on my board, then tell my system in BIOS to use the XMP profile. Booted no problem, tested with some basic benchmarking, and no problems with stability.As to what is under those heat sinks, it looks like its dual rank Hynix CJR modules (which I understand is pretty good for enthusiast overclocking). XMP at CL 16-19-19-39 is very stable from what I can tell. I am just going to keep it at XMP for the time being and call it a day personally.Original July 2022Edit August 2022:Ive had a chance to try and manually tune the sticks for better performance. The original stock XMP is 16-19-19-19-39. I tried to set the sticks to 16-18-18-18-38 and I am able to boot the system (after some auto-training done by my mobo), however, the system becomes unstable and crashes within an hour or two, especially if I do something intensive. It looks like the sticks I got are unable to be tuned for any improvement at all. Its rock solid at the stock XMP settings though. I confirmed its fine via some memory benchmarking, along with just using my system for both gaming and other everyday tasks for multiple days with no issues related to RAM at all. I did also manage to run Memtest86 at stock XMP, and I can confirm that the set of sticks I got are in perfect order, no errors at all (which is expected of brand new sticks).Edit: End of August 2022:I have to change my score from 5 to 3 because I did some troubleshooting with my system. Ive had issues in the past with RAM and compatibility with my 3700X. I noticed that I am getting random shutdowns out of the blue of my entire system. The behavior is eerily similar to when I was having issues with RAM timings before. I updated my BIOS for my mobo to the most recent version, it did help with some stability, at least for gameplay, but I dont think it helped with my stability with my RAM. After messing with a bunch of things, it looks like its the DOCP/XMP profile for the RAM. The 16-19-19-39 at 3600Mhz is too much for the memory controller on my 3700X. Zen 2 is known for having issues with RAM compatibility and stability. To avoid random shutdowns, I am now just running the sticks at the default JDEC base spec, 2133Mhz. I did find that it seems to run OK at 3200Mhz C22 (with my mobo auto setting the timings). At this point, I am fed up with my 3700X. The issues with RAM are infuriating. I have a 5800X3D in the mail right now. I am hoping that Zen 3 has had their memory controllers improved significantly over Zen 2 so I can finally just set XMP and call it a day. As a side note, AMD is not the only one that has had issues with memory controllers of their CPUs (AMD 3000 series is known for problems with high frequency DDR4), Intel has recently been found to have problems too (Intel 12th gen is having problems with high frequency DDR5). This pair of sticks is shown to be compatible with my mobo and CPU combo by both G.Skill and Asus officially, but it seems like AMD dropped the ball with some very weak memory controllers on their 3000 series CPUs (they also got in trouble with over-advertising their clock frequencies for the 3000 series), so, if you are getting this for a 3600, 3700X, 3900X, etc, be wary, there isnt a guarantee it will work with absolutely no problems. I may update later on how these sticks of RAM are like with a 5800X3D in my TUF X570 Plus WiFi.

I've been forced to replace my RAM so after a short research I've ordered Crucial Ballistix 2x 2x16GB @3200 and worked amazing straight out of the box with XMP on. Since then I've been able to overclock it mildly to @3600 CL16-18-18-36 @1.38vObviously there is a BLINK to it, I mean RGB witch is quite bright and is working good enough on my MB, but TBH I've bought the RGB version just to have it but just tried it and never used it.

Please take note of this point.OverviewProduct received: Single Rank E-die 8GB rams at 3600 mhz and the stated XMP specs.Product defects: Yes, 2 sticks of ram.Product prices: Reasonable and cheaper when I bought it, but not worth as of 10/05/2021. Only buy this product if it is cheaper compared to local alternatives by 25 SGD.Product warranty: Cannot be RMAed to amazon SG after 4 months, only to original manufacturer in US after. I am uncertain if it can be sent back within a shorter period of time (one month) to amazon, but Crucial sent the replacement quickly.Review:Recent usage of my PC showed artifacts and I tested with memtest86 and TM5, separately and together on different ram slots. It took half a day to check and I discovered two sticks of ram with errors, with one having more errors than the other.Amazon SG doesn't handle RMA when I checked with them and I eventually contacted Crucial on their website, and mailed the faulty rams back to US which cost me around 13 SGD. A replacement set was sent back pretty quickly with fedex intl priority, which is a great plus for this brand.When I bought the rams on May 2021, they cost 125.62 SGD, but the price has since inflated to 157 SGD as of 10/05/2021. If I compare it to amazon US now, the price is 69.99 USD (~100 SGD). Buying it from amazon US would save you more money than buying it from amazon SG even if you add in the shipping charges; take note of this point.On the issue of local prices, a Lazada SG seller sells the same crucial 3600 Mhz ram for 155 SGD, so if I'm to compare my original costs including RMAing my rams to US, I still saved a few dollars, more if you actually purchase from Amazon US.In conclusion, I rate this product 4/5.

The memory has operated flawlessly.I installed four of these memory modules in my new computer. They are working just fine. I ran a (self-repeating) memory test for over 24 hours prior to loading the operating system.Before you order memory modules, you should review the webpage and ""User Guide"" for your motherboard. I recently built a new computer using the\xa0\nASUS Maximus V FORMULA LGA 1155 Intel Z77 Extended ATX DDR3 2800 PCIe 3.0 HDMI SupremeFX IV Audio Motherboard\n. The ASUS website (quite conveniently) provides a Qualified Vendor Lists (QVL) of compatible memory for this motherboard (although it may not be up-to-date for 8GB modules). Your motherboard\'s vendor may have a similar list.If you purchased a ready-built computer, then look on the manufacturer\'s website to verify that you are purchasing the correct memory. For example, if you purchased your computer from the biggest computer maker, then log-on to your account, enter the Service Tag number for your computer, and then find the memory requirements. Or, you could just call and ask.My computer\'s motherboard requires (1.5 volt) DDR3 dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs), installed in ""matched sets"" for ""dual channel"" function. My motherboard\'s ""User Guide"" recommends installing DIMMs from the same vendor, with the same CAS latency, and of the same version or date code (D/C). Because of this recommendations, and because these memory modules were ridiculously inexpensive when I bought them, I went ahead and installed the maximum memory of four 8 GB DIMMs (32 GB). You can buy this memory with one pair of DIMMs or two pairs of DIMMs:\xa0\nCorsair Vengeance 16GB (2x8GB)  DDR3 1600 MHz (PC3 12800) Desktop Memory (CMZ16GX3M2A1600C10)\n\xa0or\xa0\nCorsair Vengeance 32GB (4x8GB)  DDR3 1600 MHz (PC3 12800) Desktop Memory (CMZ32GX3M4X1600C10)\n.If you are interested in over-clocking memory, then you might want to research (1.5 volt) DDR3 DIMMs with higher clock ratings (i.e., 1866 MHz, 2000 MHz, 2133 MHz, and 2400 MHz). Naturally, I wanted the 2400 MHz memory; but I decided to try the much cheaper 1600 MHz memory first.Please note: If you are only installing two DIMMS, you may need to install them in only two specific slots on the mother board (i.e., you can\'t just install them in any two slots). Check the ""User Guide"" for your motherboard to ensure that you are inserting the DIMMs in the correct slots. Of course, if you fill all slots with ""matching"" DIMMs, this will not be a concern.No matter how much physical memory you install, your copy of the Windows operating system may limit how much memory your computer can use. The 32 bit versions of Windows can only address a maximum of 4 GB of memory, with only (about) 3.5 GB of that usable.Windows 64 bit memory limits:- Windows 8 Professional: 512 GB- Windows 8: 128 GB- Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate: 192 GB- Windows Vista Ultimate: 128 GB- Windows 7 or Windows Vista Home Premium: 16 GB- Windows 7 or Windows Vista Home Basic: 8 GBLastly, I recommend that you run a memory test on your newly-installed memory. I used Memtest86+ (it\'s free). Extract the image (iso) file from the ZIP file, and then create a bootable CD by burning disc from image (do NOT copy the iso file to CD, burn disc from image). I ran this memory test prior to loading the operating system.']"

Using in Dell XPS 17 9730.Pros: Fast, ReliableCons:  A little pricey, hard to get at this time in the US for some reasonDetail:  As anyone who is somewhat technically savvy knows when you buy a new laptop the manufacturers always overcharge for memory.  I find it's always much cheaper to buy the lowest amount you can for the laptop you can and replace with new memory right away.  You can literally throw the OEM memory away and buy new and same $100 or more in the process.  In this case I also went from 4800 to 5200 speed as well.  Why did it not register at 5600 like advertised you ask?  This is not Kingston's fault.  In my case it's because there is a known issue with Intel chipsets at 64GB of memory.  I knew this before buying and only expected to get 5200.  Not sure if AMD has this issue as well, but a lot of Intel based systems do, even the top of the line Alienware 18 as of the time of this review.Reseller:  I purchased this item from a reseller out of Texas who had a lot of negative reviews, most which Amazon defended due to manufacturer/supply chain issues.  My delivery was a few days late, but did make it. I was kind of expecting this ahead of time.

It looks great on my mostly white build PC and I have it running at 5400 via a user configurable XMP profile in my Gigabyte z690 aero D-BIOS.It was not obvious at first why it was running at 4800 and that I only seemed to have one XMP profile to set. but as I discovered you can have up to 3 xmp profiles once set under advanced memory settings and SPD (Gigabyte z690 aero D)I'm sure this memory can be run at a higher frequency but that will involve changing voltages and timings which can be troublesome if not done correctly, and the BIOS will have to be reset.You can check easily if you have the correct speed by going to Windows Task manager/Performance and Memory tab, or,download cpu-z app.I will purchase another 64bg of this memory to give me a total of 128gb for my system, which will be useful for vst libraries and video editing etc. But this will more than likely require adjusting voltages, etc, to get the required speed.Highly recommended.UPDATE.  I  bought another pair of these sticks (black) for a total of 128gbI got the 64gb Corsair DDR5-5200mhz kits in the black version for an excellent price; this was to add to my Corsair 64GB DDR5-5200mhz white kit for a total of 128gb for my system. I would have preferred the white version I previously bought for my PC build, but the black sticks were much cheaper than what I originally paid; it was a no-brainer.I have these sticks and the white ones in an MSI z790 edge wi-fi motherboard. I had a Gigabyte z690 D aero, with 64gb white set in my original review , but I had to get another motherboard for various reasons.With just two sticks in my motherboard I managed to get them running stable at 5400mhz. (XMP profiles), which was great, but when I added 4 sticks at 128gb, the fastest I could get was 4800mhz, that was both motherboards.However, Recently MSI updated their BIOS for this board which included fixes for better memory compatibility, so, I decided to try get 5200mhz running again, and to my surprise it worked perfectly, for a while. But, even after passing a memory test and playing a few games without any problems, I got a windows green screen error when I was closing down an app. So then, I decided to try and get at least 5000mhz running, which I have them running at now, stable. Actually, they are running at 5067mhz.I'm very happy with this speed and do not mind losing 200mhz from the speed they are supposed to run at. In fact, the speed difference when I had 64GB running at 5200 and beyond is actually quite negligible, according to various memory tests.Overall, I think this memory performs well and is from a top tier brand, which means better compatibility with motherboards. With future BIOS updates, perhaps 128gb might run at 5200 and beyond, stable,  here's hoping.Highly recommendedUPDATE 2.MSI released another BIOS update (7D91vH4) for my z790 wifi edge motherboard, which includes improved memory compatibility and many other updates. I updated it and adjusted the Dram frequency to 5200Mhz G2, while disabling the XMP profile, and it has been running stable while doing memory tests and playing games etc.My current system specs:I9-13900kMSI z790 wi-fi edgeGigabyte RTX 4070 aeroAsus Essence STX II sound cardKingston 1tb KC3000 PCIe 4.0 NVMe M.2 SSDArctic liquid freezer II 360 RGB AiOAnother 3 nvme drives and two ssd‚Äôs"", 'Le memorie sono ottime, ho preso 4 banchi da 32gb per stare tranquillo un po‚Äô di anni.

Personalmente non ho mai avuto problemi ne di Hardware, ne di Software dall\'installazione.Piccole note prima di parlare del prodotto:- Prima dell\'acquisto vi consiglio di controllare attentamente quanti MHz il vostro Processore e la vostra Scheda Madre riescono a supportare, in modo da evitare una spesa inutile per una Ram troppo potente, per esempio se il vostro processore supporta solamente 2667 MHz, prendere una Ram da 3600 MHz sar√† inutile in quanto verr√† automaticamente bloccata dal Bios a 2667 MHz, senza avere la possibilit√† di aumentarla.

I still have hundreds of gigs of old school g.skill ddr3 ram that still work great.Yes these are Hynix and not Samsung memory, but that's okay, they're a still a good company and these kits are great. My only complaint, and while for this price it's not much of a complaint, but the white piece on the ram itself that the LED's shine through is a bit flimsy, but the kits I purchase by Corsair were same price and 400Mhz slower and did not OC very well and gave me nothing but headaches.

I don't care about RGB, just performance, and so far this ram seems to be the best value out there (if you can live without RGB).The ram works with both Intel and AMD boards. It's low profile for cases with large air coolers or AIOs and It's Samsung b-die. Overall a great value at the current price of around $160 per kit.For more than 16gb 2 (or 4) kits must be ordered so that's approx $320 (at current) but to compare: a similar Dominator 3600mhz C16 32gb kit is about $450, so $130 more for RGB at a worse spec.My motherboard has 4 dimms but if it had 8 then it would be possible to purchase 4 kits and have 64 gb. Regardless, this ram should be purchased in pairs so either 1 kit, 2 kits or 4 kits and for me the sweet spot was 2 kits for the best price to performance.Caveats: motherboard must have good power regulation. I'm using an EVGA Dark X299 so I am not concerned about the 1.45V necessary for the XMP profile. This is fine as it is rated this way by Corsair. So long as the motherboard supports this voltage just set the XMP1 profile and all good. However, I don't see this ram as being able to overclock beyond 3600 mhz since it's already overclocked by Corsair at (what I think) is close to it's maximum (listed as only PC4-21300 in HWINfo). I personally don't care since for a stable x299 daily driver 3600mhz is where I wanted to be at with C16 timing or better.

First is an ASUS Crosshair VIII Hero X570 with a 3900X and the other is a Gigabyte AORUS Extreme X570 with a 3600XT. Both worked perfectly. The Gigabyte board required that I manually set the memory voltage when setting XMP in the BIOS but I believe that to be a board issue, not a memory issue. It\'s just worth noting that this memory does require 1.45V when running the XMP profile which isn\'t a big deal, just be sure it\'s set correctly in your BIOS.UPDATE 7 months later:After now having this kit run flawlessly with a Ryzen 3900X and now a Ryzen 3600XT I have ordered another pair. It seems AMD Ryzen Zen3 actually produces higher performance with 4 sticks of ram vs. only running 2. This is opposite what we have all experienced before, but this is no longer the case with the new 5000 series lineup of Ryzen processors.

Thus I needed to go to 64Gb and at the time this kit was the best value for 4 sticks with a good speed of 3600mhz at C18 which on balance is probably faster than the previous kit but importantly is stable and a simple xmp setting in the bios and away you go. You can get faster but for the price this was spot on. The led's look nice, well diffused not too bright and you can fiddle with the patterns in software. I could have added 32gb to my existing kit but Corsair are renowned for switching memory modules so there is no guarantee that a new 'identical' kit would be exactly the same as my only kit and I didn't want to introduce any instability.

Micron rev.e is amazingly good value when compared to offerings from Samsung and Hynix in the same price category, I know Ive got the RGB version but for ¬£10 less (at the time of writing) you can get the non-RGB version which perform identically. The similarly priced kits from the other brands usually use Samsund C die, like the Vengeance RGB Pro kit I owned previously, which have very, very little room for any overclock and I think it actually caused some OS degradation.I'm yet to overclock this kit because my CPU's IMC is pretty garbage, but after I upgrade that I'll definitely be giving it a shot. Currently running the kit at the XMP settings which is 3200MHz CL 16-18-18-36.I've seen people post results of getting this 3200mhz cl16 kit up to 3800 CL16, with slightly looser primaries and secondaries ofc, but it's still mind blowing that it can be done on these cheap kits. You'd need decent Samsung B die to get this level and the kits that use them cost considerably more money, which doesn't make sense to buy unless you're aiming for 4000MHz+, but at that point you're hitting diminishing return levels.The sticks are also much lower profile than my old kit which means they won't interfere with the big tower coolers like the NH-D15 and Dark Rock 4.The kits comes out the box with the rainbow wave RGB mode which doesn't stay synced for very long. Luckily this kit supports basically all the major motherboard RGB softwares, and it also has its own Ballistix MOD software that u can use to check dimm temperature, operating frequency and timings. There's also the section to control RGB and to give Crucial credit there are lots of different customisation options.Onto the *only* thing I don't like about this kit, and that's the way they've gone about the RGB. Unlike my Corsair kit, these dimms won't keep my RGB settings after they lose power, ie after I shut down my PC. They will default to the rainbow mode until I launch the software manually. And if you set the software to boot with windows it asks for admin permissions EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. and it gets annoying, and even with the app enabled to start up it will only use the colour/mode you set; you have to change the brightness manually every time if you don't want your LEDs burning at max brightness. With my Corsair kit I could set the colour/mode/brightness I wanted and then disable iCue software from ever launching, and those sticks would remember the last setting no matter how many times I turned the PC off and on. I'm guessing Corsair were smart enough to include some type of memory chip on the RAMs PCB to remember the RGB settings without having to run any bloatware. Disappointed to see Crucial could not follow suitOther than that minor gripe, these sticks look and run great"", ""I have no complaints about the RAM itself. They have excellent quality Micron chips running @ 3200mhz with no issues. The heat spreaders are compact, well designed and I have steady temps around 29c. Great! My only complaint is the RGB. You pay an extra premium for those and it should be expected that they operate well. They are indeed bright but the color transitions are choppy as hell. They seem to only be on or off with no color blending if you are using the rainbow or other color gradient effects. Also they don't really follow a color wheel using the rainbow setting so it will transition from pure Red straight into pure Blue with no pleasant gradient through Purple. Sometimes it's Green straight into Red, skipping  what would naturally happen, which is Yellow to Orange THEN to Red. It's just Green then (BAM!) Red to start the cycle again. Part of the issue might be the software but I've used both Crucial's software and the native MB software and it's the same Choppy on/off color transitions with no smooth gradients. I may try OpenRGB next and if it doesn't work it's not the end of the world, but I expected a little better for the premium I paid for the aesthetics."", 'The pest I‚Äôve used hands down!!

This RAM works perfectly at the advertised speeds and clocks IF you've built the proper system.The best thing you can do for yourself when purchasing ANY RAM is finding the motherboard (MB) you want to use and look at the qualified list of RAM for that MB. It's how I found this RAM, I searched by part number from the authorized list for the MB and saw it was rated for the exact speeds.I've teamed this RAM with an MSI MEG X570 ACE and an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X. My MB manufacturer, MSI, has multiple stages of qualified RAM. For this MB specifically it depends on the series of processor you have. I had to look for the Ryzen 5xxxx series in the qualified list.Wouldn't you know it that when it was all installed, I boot up the system for the first time, go into BIOS, click on the XMP profile button, and it immediately sets the speed and timings to exactly as advertised. That's all you should ever have to do for a properly configured system, 1 click for XMP and that's it, simple. It has been running these exact settings for about 2 weeks now (not a long time, I know, but I'll update if anything happens) and my rig is purring like a kitten.This RAM is great, but you need to know that it works in your board. I know a lot of people have bought this RAM thinking it's essentially painting flames on the side of your car, but it won't make it go any faster. High frequency RAM like this doesn't play well in systems that aren't designed for it. sure it CAN work, but the chances of it working exactly as advertised within a system that hasn't been tested with it is slim to none, and is bound to have issues.Please, please, please do yourselves a favor and do proper research before making purchases on hardware and giving it a bad wrap because you're incompetent. It really does a disservice to others who may want to use the product but sees a bunch of negative reviews when the product itself is fine, it's the person that's the problem.I should probably add that the RAM itself actually looks very nice and I love the heatsink design. The RGB lights on it work very well in my system which is all going in a rainbow pattern. With it being in its default random rainbow wave I've not used any of the software that can control the RAM, but there are plenty of reviews on that elsewhere.Be aware, this RAM is a bit thick due to the quality heatsinks on it, so if you're using an X570 board and an LCS like I am, you may run into issues. I have literally about 1 or 2 mm between my inlet/outlet for my EK AIO 360 and my RAM that is right next to the CPU. Due to the way my system is configured, the layout of the board, and how you have to mount the waterblock I didn't have much choice, but it just barely fits, YMMV but be aware."", ""Installation was easy for the hardware.

A few days later we were able to figure out the issue after determining a component of the software didn't install correctly, which goes back to my comments about the software quality being very flakey.

Previously I had Patriot Viper Steel DDR4 4400MHz (PVS416G440C9K) and I liked the memory very well but wanted to add RGB to my system and really like the look of these Tough Ram from Thermaltake. My case fans and power supply is from Thermaltake so thought I would give these a shot as I really like their products. I ordered 4 sets (8 sticks) of the Toughram 4400MHz, It was plug and play replacement. Previously I only overclocked the Patriot to 4000MHz as I am a developer and my applications utilized heavily the multicore and wanted to make sure stability is assured as some applications can take a week or more to run. I was able to over clock these to 4000MHz with no issue at all. Unlike other users I have not had an issue at all with the RGB they have worked flawlessly for a week now.I do plan to tinker with the speed to see if I can get to 4400MHz and if I do I will update this post.', ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Yes it's vey good product and installation is very easy..

The new one was just dead on arrival. It didn't work only. Have returned the new ones back.But the existing one which is in the system is performing stable as of yet.Word of advice if anyone here is reading, please go with more trusted brands like crosair, gskill, crucial etc. Atleast you would not have wasted 26k of your money like I have.

Spending hours every day waiting while the dreaded rainbow wheel spun on the monitor was really bringing me down and killing my efficiency.  Enter the Crucial (in more ways than one) RAM upgrade.  My swap was running in the neighborhood of 2.5 gb at any given time, even with no applications running; it is now ZERO!  I cannot believe that I tolerated the slowness for so long.  I thought I was just waiting for my Mac to die, and a drawn-out, agonizing death it was going to be.  I currently have six open tabs in Safari going, as well as iTunes, which I could NEVER run in the background prior to this upgrade.  Web pages are loading lightning-quick and I can switch between/among applications instantly.  Before, I had to wait for what seemed like forever for tabs and applications *to close*.  This is amazing.  I've been contacting my Mac-owning friends all day to tell them about this quick and inexpensive fix for their computer woes.  Additionally, I had my Mac open, cleaned, RAM swapped, and everything put back together in about 5 minutes.  Highly recommended."", 'I ordered one like this off ebay and my computer crashed, because the one the person that owned it before me had in it was not the correct type.

So I ordered this one to match the one I got that was correct. The one I got on ebay said Made in USA, too bad this one says Made in China, yet it is the same memory stick. And I had to pay a lot more for it too.  But it works great with the other one to give my laptop 8 gigs of DDR3 ram.

I recently decided to upgrade my computer because it was struggling to keep up with my demanding multitasking and gaming needs.

Firstly, the 32GB capacity is a game-changer for me as it allows me to run resource-intensive applications smoothly without any lag. And let's not forget about the fact that this RAM kit utilizes DDR5 technology, which provides faster data transfer rates and improved power efficiency compared to its predecessors.

All in all, ordering this Crucial RAM 32GB Kit (2x16GB) DDR5 Memory was a no-brainer choice for me as it promises to drastically enhance my computing experience!I hope you find this review helpful."", 'This one popped up on my recommended list.  I looked at the listing, saw that it won\'t fit my computer and closed it.  Or so I thought.  Must\'ve been dozing off or something.  I\'ve had the itch to build a new system, but mine is pretty up to date for what I use it, (gaming for me is Freecell) and I don\'t have anyone in my circle of acquaintances who wants a new system.  Anyway, I may build what Boeing would call a ""white tail.""  One without a customer just to keep the lines busy.So how can I fairly review this product?  Crucial is Micron\'s finished product line.  Unless you\'re a chip-head like me, that may not mean much, but Micron memory chips are among the best.  I\'ve used their SSDs (including the one in the computer on which I\'m writing this) and RAM and have never had an issue.  I\'m a huge fan.  Several famous brands use Micron chips; when you look on the QVL of most motherboards it will tell you the chip brand and Micron is quite popular.  Looking at these through the package, they look typical first tier quality.  Good solder, good plating on the edge contacts and the chips line up on the boards. Sounds like a low bar, but not really.So to make up for not being able to fairly judge the performance, I thought that I would look up a few popular motherboards\' QVL and report.  AM5 motherboards using the B650 chipset.  For a hobbyist building a mid-grade system, that\'s what I would recommend.  If you want the latest, that is.  Checking popular motherboards from AS Rock, Asus, Gigabyte and MSI, none of them had this set on their list.  What?  Checking the Crucial website, there is a compatibility checker with drop down menus that is a LOT less frustrating than the motherboard manufacturers\' lists.  Every board that I had previously checked that didn\'t have these listed was compatible.  I can\'t officially say that they will work, I can\'t officially say that they won\'t.  But as a guess, probably yes.  Of course, that\'s the problem with a QVL.  If a particular device isn\'t on the list, does it mean that it was tested and didn\'t pass or was it just not tested?  There are about 13 zillion models of RAM sticks and substantially fewer motherboards, so if it\'s on the list for the memory but not the motherboard, most likely the motherboard manufacturer just didn\'t test it.Bottom line?  A Good Product from a Great Brand.  Even though I can\'t test these particular sticks, based on previous experience with Crucial and a visual inspection, I would highly recommend them.', 'Since Micron has thrown out the Ballistix branding (which was the special faster memory Micron has had for a while), Micron\'s consumer DDR5 under Crucial has been these memory sticks, it\'s very generic looking, but at least the PCB is black, so your build wouldn\'t look absolutely horrible.These are what I thought would be the equivalent of ""3200mhz JEDEC DDR4 memory that doesn\'t have any XMP profiles and run at the stock 1.2V"", however these things have XMP and EXPO profiles, which is not something that more generic DDR4 had. This means you can take advantage of improved performance, especially on AMD. Just keep in mind that if you do enable EXPO, you probably should make sure your BIOS is up-to-date otherwise depending on which brand of motherboard you have (especially ASUS), your CPU might explode because of a BIOS voltage flaw, that\'s been corrected by newer BIOS.(I don\'t know if your performance changes if you say, use XMP on AMD and EXPO on Intel, it\'s probably better to stick to EXPO on AMD and XMP on Intel when you select your memory profile in the BIOS)Because it\'s DDR5 it has a lot of telemetry that can be read from in HWInfo, similar to older DDR4 modules, you can actually read the temperature. Now, I assume given the relatively tame performance these don\'t necessarily need extra cooling and therefore doesn\'t have any heatspreaders. I don\'t know how well these can overclock, but if you do, maybe having some extra airflow might help if you\'re doing something crazy. I know when Crucial first launched these, the reason they discontinued Ballistix was because they couldn\'t hit higher performance memory, maybe since it\'s been a while these will actually overclock better?Overall, these are excellent if you\'re doing a SFF build. The standard module height gives you lots of space for either cooler clearance or space for cables. Previously Corsair had their LPX memory, but since Corsair hasn\'t released their LPX memory for DDR5, these are a good option. I\'m using it with a Gigabyte B650i in a Lian Li A4 h2o, and the daughterboard on the motherboard means that the lower height from these memory make cable management for the 24pin just a little bit easier. I think these are also good if you have something like a Noctua NH-D15, these will give enough clearance for that CPU cooler.', ""Micron is top notch and their Crucial Line has always served me well. Sure, 5200 might not be the fastest DDR5 but it's more than enough for any 12th Gen Intel and, frankly, probably better than running faster DRAM from a less reliable bargain brand. In real world terms, this is plenty fast for basically anybody."", 'These ram are great for DDR5 builds as they are very low profile and works with all SFF cases. You must enable XMP to get the full 5200MT/s out of any DDR5 kits to get the advertised speed. They have been very stable while gaming and any tasks. Would recommend for a budget PC build using Ryzen 7000!', ""DDR5 memory has really come down in price this year. This is a nice dual stick of memory set that works well in my system. It's not flashy with RGB, and since I can't see the inside of my PC anyway I'm fine with that. Overall, this is a real bargain and you get genuine Crucial memory for a great price."", ""The Crucial 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5 5200MHz kit with model number CT2K16G52C42U5 is best suited for OEM systems like your Alienware R15s, or your Lenovo Legion T7s etc.  The CAS latency is slowed down here at 42 and it's more compatible with those OEM motherboards than aggressive kits that uses lower timings like 36 and 38.  They will also allow you to enable XMP properly on those systems.For custom builds, it will also work.  For instance, it works with the MSI MPG Z690 Edge Wifi (DDR5 model) but it's not good value.  For the same price or lower, you can get compatible kits with faster speed (5600MHz, 6000MHz), faster timings (C36), cool looking heat spreaders and the cherry on top, RGB bling. You should check against the Qualified Vendor List (QVL) from your motherboard's support page to see what memory kits are supported to maximize your return on investment.  The Crucial kit is a last resort.In summary, if you have an OEM built system that uses DDR5, this memory upgrade kit is your best chance at finding a working one.  Everyone else should look at other options that are not only cheaper but also faster."", ""These sticks of ddr5 ram went into my computer perfectly and work as intended. I don't have any benchmarks other than it plugs in and works, but I would recommend this as a more economical source of ram."", ""This RAM kit from Crucial requires no introduction and they work as expected without issues. I have no problems with 'em running at 5200 MHz as specified; however, they do run a bit hotter/warmer than usual in comparison to others that I have. I've run PRIME95 for quite a few hours without any issues either so that's a good sign. Btw, they are 42-42-42-84-126 for those who are wondering.‚â° ValueAll things considered, these are decent RAM modules that work as expected without issues; however, they are also a bit pricey at $205 for 2x16G DDR5 @ 5200Mhz in comparison to some others. These can be as much as 30-45% more expensive than other brands with identical spec so you do have quite a few options and alternatives out there.I built (aka assembled) my first PC back in the latest 80's (with a 20 MB hard disk) and based on my experience so far memory modules usually fail (if they do) VERY early on (days, hours, or even minutes) and seldom weeks or months afterwards so if they pass the stress tests (PRIME95 or any other ones available to you) for 24-48 hours, they are generally good and should outlast any components in a PC that have mechanical movements. My point being, many options exist for these memory modules if you care to try.""]"

You can use this single stick alone as it is 16 GB. Sabrent has yet to disappoint me and I consider it a trusted brand. I do not have to worry about it being bad ram. After several months of using this ram, I have not seen any issues with this device. The specification for this ram is as followed 16 GB DDR5 4800 Mhz. In terms of gaming, this can work for that purpose. I would recommend at least 16 gb  and this works great. You do not need multiple sticks for 16 gb.. I put this into my new gaming PC and it works pretty well. I personally like the simple look of it and the heatsink keeps it from over heating. It is little heavier and thicker due to heatsink plating.  If you are planning to use this as a single stick in your desktop, this will work really well. 16 gb can run a gaming PC pretty well but it still bare minimum. It is pretty easy to install. One thing to note is that you should unplug your computer before changing the ram. Also make sure that you discharge yourself (touch metal) before handling to avoid static damage. It does not require any additional installation or setting changes (at least on my end) to make this work. Again the most important thing is to make sure you unplug your computer from the power before you install this to avoid any problems. It is just simple ram that has a pretty fast performance. It provides me with the ram I needed my gaming needs. It is also little more future proof. As a single stick, it is more than enough ram to surf the web, watch videos, and such. Be aware that for most gaming computers, 16 gb minimum is recommended. There are no real heating issues with a heat sink. It performs pretty well.  Overall this is a very decently performing DDR5 ram. It performances is strong. It is great as a single stick of 16 gb. You can use this to added ram to a gaming PC or just use it in a new computer build as a single stick. It will work great.', ""I use Sabrent for my SD card, CF express cards, and DDR4 SODIMM sticks and have found that their presentation and quality for their products is generally a tier above the rest. This DDR5 stick is no exception - it worked fine on my low-power 12th-gen 1u build. The ram has no problem sitting at 4800MHz and hasn't had any memory-related issues with my computer build.Overall, pretty simple stick that performs as expected - it's expensive, but it's DDR5"", 'This Sabrent 4800 mhz DDR5 ram is good enough to play with for an early adopter of the technology, but personally I would probably wait for decreased prices and increasing stability as the tech is employed in more mainstream consumer products. In a few years, DDR5 will be far more mainstream, and the price will be further in line with the demand, which is currently limited to tech enthusiasts.If you are going to go this route, absolutely get a second stick to pair it with. Dual channel will significantly increase your computing power, but keep in mind that DDR5 is a bit more power hungry than DDR4 and you will also need the right mobo/cpu combo to work with it.All of that said, competitors already have 5000+ mhz listed for similar and/or lower prices, and that makes this a bit pricier than it needs to be, even with the current market niche it occupies. Stability with DDR5 will continue to improve as user metrics come in and manufacturers continue to incorporate it into their newer builds.', ""This Sabrent rocket ddr5 module is fantastic (albeit pricey)! I have used many Sabrent m.2 drives and was wondering when they'd get into the ddr5 game. Now that they are here I am not disappointed! for the price (at time of acquiring) this was a great deal on a 16gb module, But now at the time of review, you can get 32gb sets for the same price. Although this is very quality ram, for the Speed and Latency I would wait for the price to come down before purchasing."", ""An interesting stick of ram. I own many Sabrent items, having used their memory card for years I was excited to try out their new entry to the ram market. These sticks didn't disappoint so to say but they are lacking XMP profiles, which for many people who don't know how to or choose not to manually overclock ram, could be a deal breaker.These sticks do like to overclock, quite well, I was able to get 6000Mhz at 1.4 volts with timings of 36-36-36-77 to run extremely stable. The memory modules are good units, SK Hynix M-dies and the controller is the pretty much industry standard Renesas P8911, that most everyone uses.Overall they have functioned flawlessly under everything I throw at them running at 6000Khz with an I9-12900K and rock solid for stabality. A great stick of ram, and I assume as time passes and Sabrent grows their ram line we will see on board XMP profiles."", ""It's good to see the price of DDR5 going down, although don't expect to go down to the cost of DDR4 soon. This 16GB module from Sabrent is equipped a heatsink, which helps for high performance applications like gaming. This isn't the fastest DDR5, but it is 1.5x the speed of 3200MHz which is still the default speed of DDR4. I noticed a pretty decent performance uplift when using this single stick, when compared to 2x8GB sticks of 3200MHz that I was using with an Intel Core i5 (12th gen).Just make sure you need this latest type of RAM when you are shopping for 12th generation Intel motherboards, unless you're buying for Ryzen 7000, in which case you won't have a choice."", ""I have a lot of time for Sabrent. I trust their SD and CFExpress cards with my most important photos, so I have no problem at all handing them the job of running the RAM in my desktop. As expected this module was a piece of cake to install, my system recognised it immediately, and after a couple of weeks of use I've had absolutely no issues with it. I'd be amazed to have any issues, to be honest. Sabrent is a rock solid brand.My only slight complaint with this module is the price. I recently installed 2x16GB DDR5 4800MHz RAM modules from Corsair into my laptop, and the pair cost $230 ( on sale from $275). This single 16GB module from Sabrent, on the other hand, currently sells at $180 (on sale from $280). I consider Sabrent among the best of the best but I also rate Corsair pretty highly, and I find it hard to justify the significantly higher price for the Sabrent modules.As far as performance is concerned, though, I couldn't be happier."", ""This SABRENT Rocket DDR5 16GB U-DIMM RAM runs at speeds of up to 4800MHz. To make the most of this RAM you'll want a MOBO that supports DDR5 RAM and you may want to consider purchasing another stick to run it in dual channel mode.I purchased a 2nd stick of this  SABRENT Rocket DDR5 16GB U-DIMM RAM to use in a Ryzen 9 build that centered around an ASUS ROG Strix Z690-F Gaming MOBO. This memory is blazing fast! The 16GB module is the smallest size most that's useful in mid to high-end builds.What I liked most about this SABRENT Rocket DDR5 16GB U-DIMM RAM was:- Fast- Good price-to-performance- Negligible thermal impact- Doesn't interfere with most CPU cooler installsWhat I liked least about this SABRENT Rocket DDR5 16GB U-DIMM RAM was:- Price fluctuations may mean you'll get better price-to-performance at some times over others. However, that's the nature of PC parts in generalOverall, if you're building a new mid to high-end system then this SABRENT Rocket DDR5 16GB U-DIMM RAM should be on your shortlist. This SABRENT Rocket DDR5 16GB U-DIMM RAM is fast, reliable, and offers good price-to-performance. It fit within my Ryzen system without interfering with the stock air cooler that came with my Ryzen CPU or the AIO I added shortly thereafter. I did find the price a bit cheaper when I purchased the 2nd module than it was when I first received this one to review. However, that's not SABRENT's fault so much as it is the nature of PC components. 4.5 out of 5.0"", ""This looks akin to their NVMe ssd drives, with a thin heat spreader in the same design fashion. I am happy to report that it is good ram, but really doesn't stand out in the crowd. It looks good next to the Sabrent heatsink/spreader design which seems very similar across the board for them.The issue here is, while good, this is not a very competitive price even on sale. 180ish on sale and you get 16gb of ram. For 200, you get Corsair Vengeance ram at 2x16GB and 5200mhz. I like the look here better, but it is not the best value is all I am trying to say. I still think it is worth 4 stars though!"", 'DDR5 is a new animal (but then again, so were DDR4 and DDR3 before it‚Ä¶) - with much higher RAM speeds and much higher memory bandwidths, it removes some of the prior bottlenecks that were starting to show up on now legacy DDR4 powered platforms.  Generally, this means that you get even faster performance which is always a good thing.Here you get a 16GB stick which is a good size - I‚Äôd always generally recommend going with dual channel (an even number of matched sticks - if your board supports it) so would say you should have either 2 or 4 of these, meaning you‚Äôd have 32GB or 64GB of RAM which is quite a good bit for usage today.  It‚Äôs largely going to be a drop in (well, click in) upgrade installation and you should be good to go if your setup supports DDR5.Price-wise, this is in line with what I would expect for DDR5 at the time of writing this review - it‚Äôs newer technology and starting to be in demand, particularly in the power-user crowd.  Combine that with ongoing chip shortages AND that DDR5 requires additional power/compute chips than prior member standards and you have a recipe for higher prices.  So this is a reasonable price for the time and what you get.All that is to say - if you have a platform that supports DDR5, this is a pretty good DDR5 module to get - I‚Äôve had good luck with accessories and components from Sabrent and this seems to be no different.  Well worth a try if you‚Äôre in the market for DDR5 memory.']"

I will no longer offer anything from Thermaltake at my store nor will I ever purchase anything for stock from them ever again.  All manufacturers these days offer such similar products that the support and reliability are ultimately what separate them.  Thermaltake has failed us miserably.  To go in the View 31 RGB Dual Tempered Glass case we have gone with the Thermaltake UX100 RGB CPU Heatsink/Fan, a 16GB Thermaltake TOUGHRAM kit, a Thermaltake RGB 750W TOUGHPOWER Grand Series PSU.  We were planning on using the pre-installed Riing 14 case fans that had factored into our purchase decision originally, but after two RMA's for the included fan controller (the original had brightness issues that were NEVER resolved, the first replacement they sent was just the incorrect part, second replacement changed nothing) and zero solutions we upgraded to the aftermarket Pure Plus 14 RGB Premium three fan kit and controller because I'm pretty reasonable and loyal.  Nice fan kit by the way, but it would only be appropriate if it was to be your ONLY RGB feature.  There is no syncing between all of these products despite Thermaltake expressly boasting that there is.

If you just leave the ram as is with no system integrated rgb controller then they dont sync up.

Verbaut sind die Riegel in einem ASUS Dark Hero mit einem AMD Ryzen 5950x Prozessor.Die Lieferung war wie immer sehr schnell (Amazon) und die versiegelte Neuware kam gut verpackt und unbesch√§digt an. Die Module f√ºhlen sich schwer und wertig an ‚Äì aus diesem Material h√§tte ich gerne ein Geh√§use, Corsair.Ich habe mich aus Performance Gr√ºnden (AMD Ryzen 5000 Generation) f√ºr die 4x16 Version entschieden. Hierbei muss jeder mit sich selbst ausmachen, ob das einem den Preis f√ºr C16 wert ist. Man darf nicht vergessen, dass man sich f√ºr die knapp ‚Ç¨1.200 schon einen Komplettrechner zulegen kann. Alle paar Jahre baue ich mir ein neues System und gehe daher keine Kompromisse ein.Im BIOS habe ich f√ºr erste Tests das D.O.C.P Profil ausgew√§hlt und die Riegel haben ""out oft he box"" stabil unter 3.600MHz funktioniert. Es gibt zwar ein wenig Overclocking Spielraum, 4.000 MHz konnte ich stabil, unter vern√ºnftigen Rahmenbedingungen, jedoch nicht erreichen. Mehr Module = weniger Spielraum.Tip: Stabilit√§tstests bitte immer z.B. mit MemTest86 (kostenlos) vom gebooteten USB-Stick durchf√ºhren ‚Äì alle anderen Methoden (unter Windows) sind untauglich und funktionieren nicht.Ein weiterer Grund f√ºr die Anschaffung war die M√∂glichkeit zur direkten Steuerung √ºber iCUE 4.x. Mein komplettes System ist sehr Corsair lastig (1000D, Commander Pro, Lightning Nodes, RGB Hubs, LQ 120/140 L√ºfter, etc.). Wer darauf keinen Wert legt sollte sich die Anschaffung gut √ºberlegen, da der Preis schon wirklich beachtlich ist. Die C17er von Trident gibt es f√ºr weniger als die H√§lfte, C18er von Corsair gibt es in dieser Konfiguration f√ºr gut ‚Ç¨600...Wirklich empfehlen kann ich den RAM normalen Anwendern nicht. Die Zielgruppe sind Enthusiasten, die ihren eigenen High-End PC bauen und sich im Corsair Universum bewegen. 64GB braucht ebenfalls kein normaler Mensch, der seine Office Anwendungen laufen l√§sst oder sich einen Gaming Rechner zusammenstellt.Kritik: Corsair w√§re gut damit beraten, an der Stabilit√§t von iCUE zu arbeiten. Manchmal werden die Riegel unter Windows 10 auf einen Asus MB nicht richtig erkannt (ich spreche hier von der RGB Steuerung) und werden in iCUE mit einem roten Warndreieck angezeigt. Dann hilft es nur iCUE zu beenden, den Lightning Service (Dienst) neu zu starten und iCUE erneut aufzurufen. Gerade im Zusammenspiel mit Aura (Asus) ist mir das sehr unangenehm aufgefallen. Die Hersteller schieben sich das Problem nat√ºrlich gegenseitig in die Schuhe.Fazit: Wer 64GB C16er Speicher mit vier Riegeln ""braucht"", RGB mit iCUE cool findet und daf√ºr bereit ist eine Niere zu verkaufen ist hier gut beraten. Alle anderen schauen sich nach g√ºnstigeren Modulen um, die √§hnliche Performance zu einem viel g√ºnstigeren Preis bieten.', 'Slipped straight in without any issues and worked first time, looks great as well.

The semi-stable maximum overclock I was able to achieve was 3800 MT/s 16-16-16-34-300 dual-rank quad-channel at 1.45 V on an X299 Dark. I didn't bother stabilizing it as I decided to return it. This dual-rank kit would not POST at 4000 MT/s with any voltage or timings - it always hung at POST code EE. I can do 4000 MT/s 16-16-16-34-275 single-rank quad-channel at 1.45 V on the same system. The RAM ran extremely hot at 1.45 V - it hit 61 C just booting to the desktop, which was probably the reason for the infrequent errors in MemTest86's random pattern test at 3800 MT/s.This kit makes no sense at its current price when the F4-3600C16Q-64GTZR / F4-3600C16Q-64GTZN is $499, and F4-3600C14Q-64GTZN is $589.

I looked at the Activity Monitor to see what was happening and noticed that the memory swap used was relatively high. I knew at that point it was time to upgrade the memory. I realized that when we originally bought the MacBook, 4Gb was sufficient, but over time with the OS upgrades, new software added, it could no longer handle it.I checked the compatibility online to make sure I got the right one, and then placed an order through Amazon. I was excited when it came and quickly shut down my laptop to install the RAM. Installation was very easy and took less than a minute (you will need a small phillips screwdriver to remove the panel of the laptop, to expose the motherboard).

Removed the new RAM, and re-inserted the old memory and everything was fine.I checked the package and model numbers, and everything was correct. At that point, I thought to myself.. there is something wrong. I returned it and re-ordered a new set. Repeated the steps, and this time, upon startup, no beeps!Everything seemed more responsive, and applications opened quickly.

I needed my own computer for general internet work and an occasional document or web meeting. The computer was very slow. I contacted the school IT department that provided the computer. They suggested formatting the HD which would erase thousands of dollars worth of software. I decided to double the memory. The manual said 8GB is the max but people were reporting they were putting in 16 GB. Upon further reading I realized I had a 13-inch and the people putting in four times the original memory had 15 and 17-inch screens. The computer is runs like a new machine.

Before installing the extra 8GB of RAM (4+4), the computer would freeze up if I dared open more than 3 apps. Work was painstakingly slow. I'm tempted to replace the 4GB (2+2) with another 8GB just for the added RAM now. But I'll see how this goes.One warning. Inserting the new RAM took a serious push.

I discovered there are many international manufacturers listed on the Internet for this part but no store in Canada keeps it in stock. A few online stores including Amazon all said shipping would take a few weeks. I found instructions from Apple on how to replace the original memory modules with these new Crucial memory modules. The problem of my iMac computer frequently crashing is now fixed. Through testing I found one of the original 4GB memory modules is okay so now I have 3 x 4GB = 12GB installed. In contrast to all of the online advice and reviews I did not notice any improvement in the speed of my iMac by upgrading from 8GB to 12GB. The Apple hardware diagnostic test full version that is needed to test the memory modules takes a few hours to run. Apple evaluated the trade-in value of my iMac as being $99.

Diese haben aber inYoutube Videos so seltsame Artefakte und gr√ºne Streifen produziert. Im Hardwarehilfe Forum wurde mir gesagt, dass sie gerne mal Fehler h√§tten. Die R√ºcksendung sowie Erstattung bei Amazon haben reibungslos funktioniert, Vielen Dank Amazon:-)So nun zur Review:Ich  habe mir die Kinston Fury Renegade 3200er RAM\'s zwei Mal  aus oben genannten Gr√ºnden gekauft.Bestellt wurden sie am 3.05, geliefert am 05.05.Packungsinhalt ist wie folgt:- 2x8 GB Kingston Fury Renegade 3200er Riegel- 1x ein kleines Garantie- und Installationsbl√§ttchen- 1x ein Kingston Fury Sticker zum Aufkleben auf\'s Geh√§useDie Ram Riegel machen aufgrund des Heatspreaders ordentlich was her.Sie haben zwer kein RGB, aber davon habe ich genug im Rechner.Zusatz 1: Ich wei√ü nicht, was die Sternekategorie ""Genauigkeit"" hei√üt. Falls damit gemeint ist, dass sie genau ins System passen, ist die volle Sterneanzahl erreicht.Zusatz 2:  Ich bewerte in der Sternekategorie ""Qualit√§t/Haltbarkeit"" NUR die Qualit√§t, zur Haltbarkeit kann ich nichts sagen, da ich die Riegel erst im System verbaut habe.Zusatz 3: Bei diesen RAM\'s handelt es sich um Kits, d.h. es sind 2 8 GB Riegel in einer Packung. Da ich aber schon eine Riegel ins System gesetzt habe, ist auf den Fotos nur einer zu sehen.Anmerkung: Die Dino\'s auf dem Bild sind nicht Teil des Lieferinhalts, ich wollte den beigelegten Sticker zeigen, aber der klebt schon am Geh√§use. :-)Ich hoffe, dass die Review hilfreich war:-)', 'It looks fantastic on my Aorus Master inside that Silent Base 802!

Had to try multiple times before 2nd slot stick stuck inside. Which was unusual, this is not supposed to happen. Fyi, this is not problem with stick but the laptop manufacturing, second slot locking pins were just tad bit smaller, HK hynix (old stick) was fitting in perfectly but this one is just fractionally bigger, and I mean real small fraction.My laptop is acer 7 aspire 715-51G 12th gen.And booting issues was solved after I removed CMOS battery pin (yes, have to remove the pin as battery is enclosed with the pin itself using black taping material. Kept pin removed for about 2 min before inserting back.Still need to do lot of checking as when on battery power laptop was not turning on, above solution is when I started using wall plug. Will try battery boot in couple of days, let the system adjust to the change first. lol sounds funny considering this is machine and not human.Try to get your hands on KC version of these sticks rather than KVR, KC ones are factory tested to work on specific models and KV ones are more general purpose.Where to check compatibility?

Don't be put off by some of the pictures you see of this that make it look like a flat, dull red.  These sticks of RAM are like a sparkly candy-apple red, as shown in some photos of it installed.Other than that, er, yeah, it's RAM.  A few things for you to consider thought when buying RAM:1. What will your CPU actually support?  A core i7 9700 (like I have) will only take advantage of 2666MHz.  You can use faster RAM like this, but the gains for Intel are marginal.2. Faster RAM doesn't necessarily mean better.  Aside from capacity, RAM also comes with a couple of other key numbers.  Speed (3200MHz in this case) and latency (C16 in this case).  You need to consider both, and there is a formula for it (assuming dual channel here):latency/speed*2000 = 16/3200*2000 = 10nanosecondsIf you do the maths, you'll see that 15/3000*2000 also equals 10 nanoseconds.  So, you'll often find that faster ram has slightly worse latency, which broadly balances out.  So why buy faster if slower can ultimately perform the same on paper?  More bandwidth - simple as that.  For a given latency, yes, more MHz is better, and you are always better off getting as much bandwidth as you can afford, but, you'll find that high speed and low latency starts to get very expensive very quickly and for marginal gains (read, bragging rights).It also depends on what you are using your PC for as to what to get.  For gaming, you aren't going to get much benefit from super-fast RAM and using more than 16GB of it.

Aufgrund extrem hohen Temindrucks brauchte ich dringend Ersatz, daher woanders per Express geordert.Da ich nicht sicher wusste wo denn nun eigentlich der Fehler lag habe ich das komplette Paket (Mainboard/CPU/RAM) bestellt (war nicht eben billig, aber in diesem Fall absolut notwendig).Erstmal nur die RAMs (jetzt Patriot Viper 4, 3733, 2St 2x8G=32G) getauscht und siehe da: Seither ist Ruhe.Sowohl noch mit dem 3-1200, als auch mit nem Ryzen 7, keine Probleme mehr.Es war also eindeutig der Speicher.All der √Ñrger hat ne Unmenge Zeit und Nerven gekostet (ein-/ausbauen, neu installieren, testen, Kopp auf Tischplatte hauen etc pp. und all das nicht nur einmal).Habe quasi alles retourniert (CPU, die RAMs und die SSD), was blieb mir denn sonst auch √ºber?Ausdr√ºcklich loben m√∂chte ich Amazon, all der Krams wurde sehr kulant und zu meiner absoluten Zufriedenheitabgewickelt.

I read some of the reviews from others who have this model and even though the Apple website says it only holds 8GB, apparently people have been successful with 2 8GB sticks. I don\'t use my laptop for gaming, but I use fairly large programs to build websites, and just a lot of general multitasking, so I opted for getting 2 sticks of 4GB (so 8GB total).It was easy to install, I watched a YouTube video for my specific model. I did have to purchase a Phillips head #00 screwdriver from the hardware store, it was $5. Make sure you put the screws into a little bowl or something because the top right 3 are longer but the others are the smallest screws I have ever seen.When I first turned on my computer again, only one RAM stick was reading, the other said ""empty"". I switched them out again, putting the top stick on the bottom and the one I had on the bottom, I put on the top just to make sure it wasn\'t the RAM itself. It wasn\'t, I was an idiot and didn\'t have it in right I guess. Second time booting up, I went to About this Mac and Memory, it was reading correctly at 8GB total.The first thing I noticed was that when I switched user accounts, it loaded right away, as before it would take a good minute or more to switch over to the other user\'s log in screen. Also, my iMessages app would take ages to start and load messages, it worked almost instantly. My MacBook is running really fast as compared to before, so I am very happy with this purchase! I can\'t speak to using a total of 16GB of RAM because I didn\'t install that, BUT from other reviews I definitely think that it\'s fine with this particular model. Here I was looking at buying a new MacBook Pro, I just saved myself literally $1000 lol! This brought some new life back into my computer, so if you\'re looking for speed and loaded apps/multitasking it\'s totally worth it, I definitely think I have myself a couple more years on this bad boy.', 'This kit worked great with my Mid-2012 MacBook Pro 15\'\'.To start off, I\'m not a gamer. I don\'t do heavy computing and I\'m not a big computer nerd. I use my computer for everyday things - surfing the internet, writing, using my calendar, communicating with friends, Excel/Word/Powerpoint, music & sampling, along with some designing (with Photoshop & Illustrator).Before I bought this, my computer was abnormally slow even though only half of my hard drive was full (it was slow to wake up, it took a while for apps to load, and there was always a lag when I switched apps). As soon as I switched my memory from 4GB to 8GB, it made a tremendous difference. All my apps run fast, I never have to reboot my computer (although I still do periodically) and everything feels like when I first got my MacBook.If you\'re on the fence of buying this, stop. Do your research and figure out if you really need this, otherwise you\'ll just waste your time, money, and energy. Use the Utilities found on your computer and specifically, ""Activity Monitor"" to determine how much memory your computer is using. I was pushing 3.99GB when I had 4GB available - that was problem #1. Oh, and if your computer is old, changing your memory is pointless. Just get a new computer.If you\'re looking to make your computer start faster, the problem isn\'t your memory (most likely). The problem is your hard drive - so you need to get a faster and bigger hard drive if your computer is too slow to boot up.And lastly, switching memory isn\'t the magic cure to making your computer run incredibly fast. You still need to take care of your computer - that means, periodic cleaning of your files, cache, and junk. Turning it on and off every now and then, and making sure you back up your files.You really only need to make a memory switch if 1) your apps are slow to load and it takes a while for you to switch from a program like Microsoft Word to Chrome. 2) When you wake your computer, it takes a solid 20-30 seconds before you can do anything. 3) Your Activity Monitor shows that you\'re pushing the limits for your memory.If you meet all of those qualifications, then get this! If not, figure out what you need by doing a Google search.', 'I upgraded my Mac Book Pro (mid 2012) from 4gm to 8 gb ram‚Ä¶..now enjoying the excellent speed. Great purchase.', 'My early 2011 Macbook Pro was slowing down to a crawl and I was beginning to see the spinning rainbow more and more often. Simply trying to open iPhoto took several minutes to load. I had looked into increasing my ram, as I still had the stock 2gb and amazon had the cheapest prices I could find. I tend to have several tabs open on Google Chrome while having music playing in the background and some other small tasks, so I thought 8gb would be enough, rather than shelling out $50+ more for the 16gb. Making the swap was easy and there are plenty of YouTube videos available if you need some help. It\'s as simple as unscrewing the bottom, making the swap, screwing it back on, and powering on your computer and letting the machine do the rest. Make sure not to lose any of the small screws while doing this. Ultimately I\'m happy with my purchase but I wish I had spent the extra money for the 16gb. Make sure to open up Activity Monitor and see what your usage is before ordering. No complaints and my graphics even increased from 300mb to 512. I read that you don\'t need ""for Mac"" branded ram and regular DDR3 1600 will work but I decided not to risk it, and this version was even cheaper than the regular ones.P.S. If you really want to see your computer running like brand new, I would recommend installing an SSD drive. I went with the Samsung 850 EVO and my boot up time has decreased from a few minutes to a few seconds. (20<) Even my power consumption has decreased, allowing my battery to last a while longer and I don\'t feel the computer overheating anymore.While not the cheapest, these improvements are great investments and more affordable than shelling out for a newer computer.', 'I have had my Apple Macbook Pro (early 2011) now with basically no problems at all. The only thing I started realizing was the speed of everything. It took a long time to open any window. I started looking into upgrading memory and was told by apple to check out Crucial Memory. On their website they have a computer scanner that will quickly scan  your system to let you know what size you need and the maximum amount you can add. I located it and soon realized it was cheaper on Amazon\'s website with free shipping. I would recommend doing this. Crucial Still will back up their products even if you buy it from a third party company. The serial numbers however didn\'t match up which first had me concerned. I spoke to someone at Crucial and they advised the numbers may be different due to it not coming directly from the manufacture. So don\'t be fooled by the numbers.Installation was an absolute breeze. Quickly was able to unscrew all the little screws and pop out the old memory cards. Make sure you install the new ones the exact was the old memory comes out. Within 30 seconds it was installed.Now for the moment of truth. I checked the system under ""about this Mac"" and it now shows I have 8GB instead of 4GB. The results are absolutely amazing. I no longer have to wait for different programs to open. I also no longer get the little spinning wheel from time to time. It was a great buy and I would highly recommend it to anyone with a apple computer. Even if your speed seems okay, spend the money and upgrade! You won\'t be upset! Any questions please feel free to ask me. I can help you to the best of my ability.', ""Normally, I'd write very in-depth reviews; however, in this instance, there isn't a need. The RAM pictured on the product page is what you receive, in a well-protected factory-sealed blisterpak. As long as you know what RAM you need (you can go to Crucial's website and use their Memory Advisor to see what chip your particular laptop needs and how much RAM your machine can handle -- in my case a DDR3-1600, for my son's Asus laptop), this is quite simply a five-star product that will breathe new life into your machine. The chip installed in seconds. My son's machine recognized it without issue. As expected, the upgrade allowed my son to do more multi-tasking. He's happier with his laptop; and, if he's happy, so am I. In my experience, if you go Crucial, you can't go wrong and I have no problem recommending this purchase.Of note, I worked, professionally, and continue to work, on the side, in the computer-repair business for 15+ years. While RAM upgrades are usually the least expensive and easiest of all the upgrades you can make to your machine, always ensure you know what you are doing before opening any machine. If you never replaced a RAM chip before... research, research, and research some more. If you don't know what you're doing -- RAM replacement is fairly simple and straightforward, but, if done wrong, can fry a motherboard (I learned that from experience many, many years ago) -- take your machine to someone who knows what they are doing. While I doubt I'll have a need to do so, given my extensive positive history with Crucial chips, if I have a need to change my review, for better or worse, I'll do so ASAP.

Wish i could leave 4.5 stars as it's a relatively minor thing, but I suppose if you don't know to look for it you won't realize that its running at a lower speed.P.S. If you are buying this for use in an AMD-capable motherboard, I have no idea how your experience with the memory speed will go.Overall, very glad i purchased this!""]"

Es gibt hier eher marginale Abweichungen, wobei im Zweifelsfall das Online-Material gegen√ºber dem Buch (verst√§ndlicherweise) aktueller ist und auch teils korrigiert wurde.Diese Korrekturen sind an einigen Stellen wirklich dringend notwendig, denn das Buch enth√§lt an vielen Stellen gravierende Satzschnitzer, falsch eingesetzte Schreibweisen englischer W√∂rter (""than"" statt ""then"", ""where"" statt ""were"", etc.), bei denen das Lektorat ziemlich geschlafen haben muss. Legenden zu Abbildungen sind auch eher die Ausnahme.Auch wenn das Buch den unbefleckten Leser meist recht einsteigerfreundlich an Aspekte des In-Memory Data Managements heranf√ºhrt, kann es inhaltlich doch leider nicht durchg√§ngig √ºberzeugen. Wo in manchem Kapitel noch technische Konzepte ausf√ºhrlich beschrieben und Abl√§ufe mit Abbildungen detailliert skizziert werden, wird in anderen Abschnitten einfach nur in teils recht knapper Prosa √ºber Konzepte hinweggehuscht, ohne auch nur ansatzweise in\'s Detail zu gehen - scheinbar nur, um das Thema wenigstens einmal angesprochen zu haben.Insgesamt wird das Buch in keiner Weise den Qualit√§tsanspr√ºchen gerecht, die ich an Fachliteratur dieser Preisklasse stelle.F√ºr einen Kauf dieses Buches spricht r√ºckwirkend betrachtet allenfalls, dass man mit dem Buch auch schon Themen der darauffolgenden Wochen durcharbeiten sowie sofort auf die L√∂sungen der Self-Tests im Anhang des Buches zugreifen kann, noch bevor diese √ºber die Online-Plattform freigegeben werden. Daher also 2 Sterne.Wenn man nichts dagegen hat die Kursmaterialien am Bildschirm zu lesen bzw. sich auszudrucken und wenn man auf die Freigabe der Self-Test-L√∂sungen bis zur n√§chsten Woche warten kann, dann kann man das Geld ebenso sparen und sich mit den Online-Materialien begn√ºgen.', 'And how the future is possible today with in-memory technology. Just great to get a good understanding on how this technology will change our world!']"
