Good packaging.', ""This review is for the Seagate IronWolf 4Tb model. Amazon groups reviews for drives of varying capacities for the same model family  together, so hence the clarification.My first experience of a Seagate internal drive was when I purchased the 8Tb Ironwolf a couple months back (See my review here on Amazon). Since then, the drive has functioned perfectly. That drive is being used in my NAS and since the review of that drive, I have upgraded my 13 year old NAS to a new unit.However, i recently reached a point where I was running low on space on my existing 4 WD Red 4Tb drives, so wanted to add another WD Red 40EFRX model. Searching Amazon and other resellers, I couldn't find this exact model available any more, since being replaced by the WD Red Plus 40EFZX. I wanted matched drives, despite my new NAS using a RAID implementation not demanding this. However, being perhaps old fashioned, I really wanted identical drives.What to do?Well, I could add value to my old NAS by installing the 4 WD Red's I have and sell it. With that goal in mind, I looked to replace the WD's with new 4Tb Ironwolf's. Having been impressed with the 8Tb Ironwolf I have as a stand alone drive in my NAS, I was further tempted by the 20% cheaper 4Tb Ironwolf's compared to the WD Red Plus equivalents, no mean saving when looking to purchase 5 of them!Amazon was selling the Seagate Ironwolf's for just £80 at the time of purchase. This was just too good a deal to ignore, so I purchased 3 of them. Oddly, and something I've never encountered before, Amazon was restricting my purchase to a maximum of just 3. There appeared no stock limitations to account for this, though. That put me in a pickle, but thankfully the wife had her own Amazon account and so I was able to obtain the remaining couple of drives at the aforementioned excellent price.So, how do these compare to my old WD's?Before that, a word on packaging. I've read a few reviews on Amazon complaining about how Amazon ship drives. Be assured that all 5 of the drives ordered, as well as the 8Tb one a couple of months back, all arrived in robust boxes.Perhaps the most surprising thing about these 4Tb Ironwolf's is their size. They are noticeably smaller and lighter than my old WD's. The casing appears slimmer, especially towards the connector end of the drive. They still conform to standards, so will fit into systems, but I'd never seen a drive so noticeably different in its size before. The WD drives definitely feel heavier and more solid, but they are 5 years old, so perhaps use more platters to achieve the same capacity, I'm not sure.I haven't benchmarked these drives, but I understand these Ironwolf's are faster than their WD counterparts and are, of course, all CMR type drives. They also boast an impressive cache size for such a relatively low capacity drive at 256Mb. The newest WD equivalent offers half of that, The Ironwolf also runs around 20MB/sec faster transfer rate at around 200 Megabytes/sec compared to my older WD's.These 5 new drives have all gone through many hours of cloning functions as I sequentially replaced each WD in my array with a new Ironwolf and then an 18.5 hours RAID expansion when adding the fifth drive. All has gone well.These drives run cool and quiet, although they are still noisier than my old WD's. I can hear the seek on these where I was unable to hear anything on the WD's I had before. Nothing major at all, but noteworthy all the same. On a slight tangent, when discussing noise levels, the 8Tb Ironwolf I do have ticks away when idle. It makes a click sound about every 6 seconds or so, so that may bother those seeking a higher capacity model in quiet environments. However, this characteristic is shared with my external 14Tb WD Elements drive, so I believe this clicking is a function of higher capacity drives. The 4Tb drives reviewed here do not exhibit such clicking sounds when idle an spinning.My new NAS now uses a pair of 120mm fans as opposed to the single on the old NAS. This appears to keep drive temperatures nice and low, even the 8Tb 7,200rpm Iron Wolf I was slightly concerned about when running in my old NAS, the temperature differential so far being only an extra 2 or 3C over the  5,400rpm Ironwolfs in the new NAS.For those like me installing these 4Tb Ironwolf's into their Synology NAS's, a word of warning. On my DSM 7.1 system, these new 4Tb Ironwolf's(Model: ST4000VNZ06) appear not to have the Seagate Ironwolf health Management feature available to DSM. The 8Tb IronWolf I have has this feature show up fine in DSM 7.1. As far as I know, IHM (IronWolf Health management) is a feature of all IronWolf drives, but I may be wrong on that front. Either way, if this model does come with that feature, Synology's DSM 7.1 currently cannot recognize it, so you will be limited to only an S.M.A.R.T test option on those.Other than that, those Seagate IronWolf 4Tb drives still offer excellent value for money and, so far, the 5 I have are working fine. As on my 8Tb review, I will update this one should any of the drives fail within, or soon after, the 3 year warranty period.In summary, these 4Tb IronWolf drives offer exceptional value for money along with excellent performance. At current prices, they are a tempting option for those wanting a desktop hard drive in the form of the WD Blue or Seagate Barracuda ranges. You will get superior performance and better reliability with these over their desktop counterparts."", 'El Seagate IronWolf es un disco duro diseñado específicamente para sistemas NAS (Network Attached Storage) y ha demostrado ser una opción confiable y de gran capacidad.

So far so good.My most pleasant surprise was just how quiet they are. I can have them running at full tilt and it's like they're not even on.

Unfortunately, it's been done in a very stupid way. After 3 years of runtime hours, a warning will pop up telling you to replace the drive. This would be fine, if it was dismissible, and if it did not override any other warnings and prevent you from seeing other warnings. 3 years of runtime hours on a NAS drive is nothing, and drives should be expected to run for at least 5 years. So you can see how this is an issue. It's a money grab from WD.Another issue is that WD has been sending out different drives under the Red branding, that are not actually reds, but instead are something else (i unfortunately cannot remember right now, a simple google will give you the info). I will probably keep buying WDs for my personal home server where I don't use Synergy since it's not a RAID (yet), but for any production environments please be aware of the issues."", 'Affidabile', 'Ottimo servizio del venditore,problemi sul prodotto comperato,ma risolto con il venditore perfettamente,sono stati molto gentili e cortesi veloci nelle operazioni da me richieste.grazie', 'Buon disco, durato circa 3 anni in ore di funzionamento su NAS in raid.

Once you initialize the drive as GPT, you should format it as required. These WD Blue drives yields 7.28 TB of drive space total after it\'s formatted in it\'s entirety.

Most of the other drive enclosures operate at 3.0 speeds and would make drive backups slower than necessary on a 5640 RPM drive.With that said, I highly recommend these WD Blue drives for passive backup storage.

It would have been nice if Amazon\'s packaging had been better, a single layer of bubble wrap in one of those Amazon book mailers isn\'t adequate, but that said it arrived without dents or obvious external damage.This drive is significantly more noisy than my 10 year old WD Red and even in a sound dampened case I can hear it clicking away. That said it\'s not particularly loud, completely tolerable even though I\'m sitting right next to it and anyway it\'s aimed primarily at datacenters where this isn\'t going to be a concern so should probably be expected.Speed ranges from an initial speed of about 238MiB/sec to 98MiB/sec under a full disk write. In practice this disk is pretty fast for spinning rust. It does seem to run a bit hot under heavy load so I\'d suggest monitoring it\'s reported SMART temperature (max 46°C) and relocating the drive / increasing fan speeds as appropriate.As for installation, I do what I normally do with new drives and ran a SMART extended (long) test which took a little under 8 hours. This test reveled several bad sectors and after two more runs with a write in between the bad sector count had somewhat strangely decreased but was still there. The acceptable number of bad sectors on a new drive is zero, and given I probably wouldn\'t be getting that deal again I decided to avoid returning it and instead raise a warranty claim with Toshiba.Although the web-based claim process was easy there were a couple of snags: it has to be sent to their service center in Germany and thanks to the ""no trade barriers"" Brexit deal you *cannot* simply print off a CN22 and stick it to the box. Instead you need to print off *3* copies of the supplied proforma invoice, include 2 of them in a clear document pouch ON the box (not IN the box!) and give the third to the courier / parcel shop. Toshiba provide a label, which you print off and then can either arrange free collection or take to a UPS-contracted \'parcel shop\'  / convenience store. I went with the latter although probably should have just arranged collection; I\'m not sure what was going on but I got the impression the store really didn\'t want to take the package even though it was small.Total turn around time was 5 working days with it sent out on Monday and a brand new replacement back in my hands Friday. Excellent service Toshiba!', 'Schnelle Lieferung, super Verpackung, technisch einwandfrei', ""I bought four of these for a NAS after extensive research. In terms of what's on the spec sheet, they blow the usual competition for NAS storage drives out of the water. They're cheaper, have lower URE rates, and very respectable MTBF times et al. I ran them for a month problem free, so while not long enough to get a true idea of review, I got a feel for their general characteristics in operation.In reviewing which drives to go for, something I hadn't bothered to take heed of is how noisy the drives would be. The first time I powered up the NAS in my living room I couldn't believe how noisy four of these operating at once were. The humming sound can only be described as a constant booming base note that is felt rather than heard and whenever the drives were accessed the sound is like a deep thrum that resonates around the room. I am a light sleeper and no matter where I placed the NAS in my home the sound of it operating disturbed my sleep - placing two walls between it and me still didn't fully filter out the sound!Unfortunately largely due to this noise issue I reconsidered my use of a NAS in the home. My concluding words would be, if you need excellent value enterprise storage in a situation where noise isn't a concern, I would recommend these drives.

At the time I bought these (cyber monday 2016) the HGST was the same price as the Seagate Ironwolf, and the WD Red was $15 more. After extensive review reading, spec reviewing, etc. I decided to go with this drive. My reasoning behind this was the fact that this was a newer generation drive with technology integrated to provide more features and benefits related to NAS use than competitor NAS drives. Also, for the supposed 1% failure rate of the HGST I was surprised to see as many negative reviews as I did. Red's seemed like a coin toss to me.Seagate has done a lot to improve the reliability of their drives in order to stay competitive in this market. I felt confident in my purchase, and I still do.The last (2) Hard Drives I put in this Synology NAS were 1TB WD Blacks. Both of the failed immediately out of the box and had to be RMA'd (purchased from Newegg). I know black wasn't correct for NAS, but at the time I purchased the NAS I wasn't exactly flush with cash so I bought what I could afford. I left them as separate volumes with no RAID or JBOD, that way if one failed only the data on it would be lost. Both of the replacement WD Blacks have lasted since December 2012. One of them will now only write at 12MB/s, but is otherwise okay, and the other one is in perfect working order. Over the years the data on those drives become more and more important. I decided that it was time to upgrade to a decent capacity and to go RAID 1 for redundancy data protection.The Synology took almost a full day per drive to perform it's initialization and error checking process but both of these Seagate 4TB Ironwolf drives work flawlessly. They operate quiet as well.The only con is the write speeds. The WD Blacks I had were 7200rpm and the 4TB version of the Seagate Ironwolf is only 5900RPM. I've got gigabit Ethernet and other than the drives, no other variables have changed. The fully functioning WD black I could write on, from my PC over the wired network, to the tune of about 20MB/s. The weak WD Black could only write about 12MB/s. The Ironwolf is 10MB/s. Now it should be noted that before the WD Blacks were individual volumes and not in RAID. These Ironwolf drives are in RAID 1 so that may cause a little slow-down on the write speeds I suppose.I'd recommend, to anyone who could afford it, to get this drive in either the 6TB (because it's 128MB cache and 7200rpm) or 8+TB (because it's 256MB cache and 7200rpm). If you're like me, and money is a consideration and you're willing to sacrifice a little speed to get a better dollar to terabyte value then you really can't go wrong with the Seagate Ironwolf 4TB (lower capacities not a better value at current $:TB).Edit 12-30-16: I'm not really sure what happened because I haven't changed anything but the consistent write speed of a large video file (3GB+) is about 19MB/s and smaller files (like 300MB) are like 22-25MB/s. Obviously the initial burst is higher, but this is what the data transfer speed drops to once it settles down."", 'Sou fotografo entao precisava de um hd grande pra armazenar fotos e também rápido, esse foi a melhor escolha pra mim, recomendo, em breve vou pegar outro, se possível de 8 tb', 'When I saw this item on the Vine program I thought it would be a perfect addition for my NAS, so I ordered it.  Here is what I found:  1.  This is a nice home or small business Drive for a NAS (Network Attached Storage) system.  It has good size (4TB) and it is reasonably priced for the size.  The data transfer rate is excellent and the memory is reasonable for the drive size.  2.  The drive runs cool compared to other NAS drives I have had by about 5 degrees.  This is a nice feature when you are putting 8 of these things into an enclosure as the heat adds up.  Since most of the NAS units out there have fans that are controlled by heat, having less of it means the fans run slower and thus the unit is quieter.  3.  While the listing shows that this drive is a 7200RPM drive, the documentation on the Seagate Website states differently.  It shows the drive speed as 5900 RPM.  You can look at this two ways.  Because it is running slower, it generally uses less power and creates less heat.  Because it is running slower, it will not be able to access data as fast.  So, you have to decide which attribute is more important to you.  4.  With respect to noise, I do not hear any noise from this drive when it is in its enclosure.  So, i am not sure why there is a comment on the site that states this drive is noisy because it is one of the quietist drives I have used.  5.  Having a drive that is designed specifically for a NAS is important due to the vibrations that multiple drives mounted next to each other can create.  Those vibrations can induce errors into the read/write functions which it NOT a good thing.  I have done multiple large file transfers into and out of this unit (1TB size) and everything has worked perfectly and remains quiet.  While I did remove a star for conflicting information about drive speed, this drive does appear to deliver and so far runs and works great.  Time will tell if it really is reliable or not.  Obviously, that is not something that I can comment on yet.  However, I was impressed enough with the drive that I did order 7 more drives through Amazon to set my entire NAS (8 bay unit) up with these drives.  All of the drives are working perfectly and I do expect that they will continue to do so.  While this unit does not carry the 5 year warranty that a Enterprise rated drive would, the 3 year warranty is sufficient for me for my small business.  I would recommend these drives if you have a NAS and you are looking for drives for it.', ""I have... let's see... two 2 TB Iron Wolf's (left over now), four 4 TB Iron Wolf's, four 6 TB Iron Wolf's, and four 12 TB EXOS X16 drives, (if you want to count those.) To make this work the best way possible, I had to order two more of the 4 TB drives. (I already had two - in a really weird combination RAID with the 2 TB drives.) They got here and I put them in one of the NAS's with the other 2 and it's synchronizing them right now -- FLAWLESS, as usual!  They came in an electrostatic bag, in a sausage link-sized bubble wrap thing I've never seen anything like! Superbly packaged. All that so I can say: I have NEVER had EVEN ONE problem with an Iron Wolf (or an EXOS) hdd.  I need more stars to give them.

Personally, I will perfect WD Red Plus.', 'Even though these are officially not on the approved hardware for the Synology DS918+ and DX517 expansion cabinet, they seem to work and seem to work well.With the setup, I have a maximum of 9 slots for drives (4 on the DS918+ and 5 on the DX517).  I have two 4-drive volumes with drive 5 on the DX517 being used as a hot spare.  Best to allow a failed drive to immediately start the repair on the hot spare than get the money and wait for a drive to arrive while you sweat whether or not another drive will fail in that time.One thing I noticed different than the 10TB WD100EFAX-68LHPN0 drives they replace.  These are 7,200RPM where those are 5,400 RPM.  Though that has not been a problem with my RAID-5 setup.  Also, the pull about 2 less watts of power per drive and run about 10-degrees F lower in temperature.While rebuilding the volume, each drive replacement on the DX517 took about 36 hours.  It seems it will take about 15 hours on the DS918+ so I have to attribute that to a bandwidth limitation between 918+ and the expansion cabinet, not a limitation of the drive.  22TB in 15 hours is pretty OK considering all the space that has to be touched.I picked the Reds because they are designed to be in close proximity with other drives meaning they can adjust their RPM a little to reduce effects of vibration plus they have a higher meantime between failure.  Regardless, have a great backup strategy in place.  The 10TBs have been around for well over 5 years and never an issue except I ran out of space.They do hurt the pocketbook but that is due to how new 22TB is.  Leading edge will do that.  As larger drives come to market, I imagine the price on these will go down.  I have read reports that in the future 40TB and 50TB will be possible but then you run into how much longer arrays will take to rebuild.  I think the strategy at the large cloud server services is to use much more numbers of lower drive space drives to keep the rebuild times lower at the expense of more drives in place.', ""Using 2, 4TB drives in a home RAID array for photos, videos, etc. Main drive is an SSD but decided to go with these for bulk storage as they are a bit cheaper (guessing my last time buying HDD's and next time will just use SSD's because they are just so much faster).Drives seems to perform nicely and other than a little HDD noise here and there don't find them bothersome at all. Previously had 2, 2TB of these red drives in a RAID array (had it running for about 8 years) and never had any issues. In our office we have Gold versions of these running on a backup server for about 6 years with no issues. All in all, very reliable. Speed is fine, but obviously not going to compare to SSD.One thing about size of the drives which I see some comments on...The size of the 4TB drive is going to be approximately 4 trillion bytes (mine is 4,000,765,177,856 bytes), however your system will likely report that as 3.64 TB or 3.726 GB. The reason for this is that Windows computes 1GB as equal to 1,073,741,824 bytes and 1TB as equal to 1,099,511,627,776 bytes. These numbers are achieved by raising 2 to an increasingly greater power till you get your first number in the billions and then trillions. There is some technical reason why this is done, but ultimately it is just confusing as it creates 2 different ways of computing size. One, counting the actual number of bytes and the other, dividing your bytes by one of those numbers to get the amount of GB's or TB's. For MB the number Windows uses is 1,048,576 bytes (for example a 20,000,0000 byte file will be reported as 20,000,000 / 1,048,576 = 19.07MB).In any case, here is a summary of the approx drives sizes and around what Windows will report the size as (assuming the drives sizes represent actual bytes exactly, so 4TB for this calculation will be 4,000,000,000 bytes and not the number my computer showed above... so expect the actual numbers to be slightly higher than these):2TB Drive = 1.82TB or 1,862.65GB4TB Drive = 3.64TB or 3,725.29GB6TB Drive = 5.46TB or 5,587.94GB8TB Drive = 7.28TB or 7,450.58GB10TB Drive = 9.09TB or 9,313.23GB20TB Drive = 18.19TB or 18,626.45GBHope this clears up some confusion here."", ""needed to expand capacity of NAS box, this drive has worked as expected for WD Red Pro, through my NAS I am regularly getting over 150MB/s write times which I'm happy with, if only the network at work could handle write speeds that quick""]"

If you handle or touch them improperly, you can cause ESD damage to the internal circuits of these drives, rendering them inoperable immediately or some time later (known as latent damage, which is an important cause of reduced reliability of the drives), depending on the nature of the damage you caused. With latent damage, you can\'t predict when the drive will fail. It can fail at any point during your use of the drive. It can fail right after you power it up or it can fail a year or two later. Its basic effect is to reduce the reliability of your drive in some way. That is simply the insidious nature of ESD.Because of the risk of ESD, you cannot handle and touch the drives like other consumer electronic devices. You need to follow proper ESD-protection procedures. Since, by default, these drives were intended to be used by those know how to properly handle them, the manufacturers do not typically include ESD warnings other than the anti-static bags that they come packaged in. (You can, of course, google for ""antistatic bag"" to get more information. In the search results, you will see a link to a Wikipedia article about the bag. As an electrical engineer, I can tell you that it is accurate when it describes the purpose of the bag, how it works, and how to handle objects that are contained in those bags. I am not as familiar about the different types of bags that are available.)The insidious nature of ESD means that the damage can manifest itself in many different ways, so no two ESD-damaged drives will necessarily malfunction in identical ways. When I see people reporting hard drive failures and they are different, especially if there are multiple failures being reported by the same person (especially if that same person reports dead on power-on for multiple drives, whether they were bought at the same or at different times), that is an important clue that ESD damage due to improper handling was the most likely cause of the failures.The fact that ESD does not always cause immediate failures or problems (but, instead, can cause latent damages which can cause the drive to prematurely fail sooner than the manufacturer\'s expected life expectancy) unfortunately misleads consumers into false beliefs that they are not causing problems when they do not follow proper ESD-protection procedures.The above notice comes from my experience as an engineer working for a company that uses ESD-sensitive devices in our products. The company sells to a major customer that uses the products for life-critical applications, where a failure of our product can kill people. (Our products also have internal self-test and diagnostic functions built in to warn of any possible impending failures of internal components, so that the customer can respond before the product actually fails.) For regular consumers like you, that, of course, does not necessarily apply. So you can choose to do whatever you want with the above ESD warning. And, yes, I do understand that vast majority of the consumers like to feel empowered or do not want to pay extra by installing or using these drives themselves.But do note that if you do not know or follow the proper ESD-protection procedures when handling the hard drives, the drives\' MTBF specifications go out the window, which means you can no longer rely on the level of reliability that was designed into them by the manufacturer. The reliability then becomes unknown and most likely will be worse than what they came with before you touched them.Since the general public most likely do not know the proper ESD-protection procedures, it is not surprising for me to see the one and two-star reviews complaining about drive failures. I would however be wary if the number of those poor reviews is very high compared to the number of four and five-star reviews, since, statistically, not all drives will have catastrophic ESD damages after being handled by their owners. If the drives are designed well, most of the drives should be fine during at least the first one or two years, which falls within the timeline of most of the reviews. This, at least, is my personal opinion and guideline on how to assess the online reviews before deciding to purchase a drive.And, yes, in case you\'re wondering, I do follow proper ESD-protection procedures when I handle internal hard drives.Now, on to my review of the Toshiba hard drive.Unlike most people, my most important criterion for a hard drive is not performance but reliability. I save files that are important and valuable to me for various reasons. So not losing those files is more important to me than other criteria like the read/write speeds. (For those who say that NAS can mitigate failures of individual drives, I agree. But I also care about the reliabilities of individual drives since, if too many of the them fail within a certain amount of time, even a NAS cannot help you. But that\'s just me. You can of course do whatever you want. It is your money and your data.)I originally used Seagate and WD drives years ago. I discovered that most of them failed much sooner than they should have, based on the manufacturers\' claims. It seemed that the drives were not made using proper procedures. (I know what kind of QA shortcuts that managers of manufacturing plants can take if they are under pressure from the HQ.) So I began searching online for hard drive brand reliabilities and discovered that HGST was highly rated. During years of using their internal hard drives, not a single one failed on me. This was refreshing after my experience with the Seagate and WD drives. But after HGST stopped operations as an independent company after WD acquired it, I needed to find a different brand. I was not going to trust WD again.One day I discovered the Toshiba brand of internal hard drives. At that time, there weren\'t many reviews of those drives. So I decided to take a chance and try them out. I first tried their 4TB drives and now I\'m using their 8TB drives. I\'ve been using them for several years now. None has failed on me so far, except for one that came in very badly damaged box (the one that the drive was packaged in; the box itself was shipped in a flimsy plastic bag). That one failed to format and made strange noises, almost as if the internal mechanical moving parts were grinding against themselves. Amazon replaced it very quickly and the replacement has worked flawlessly.', 'I read some slander review about ESD ruining the drive, failure was due to the user.First off let me be frank, its a hard drive...these things happen when they\'re shipped around, especially by (lets face it) people who really don\'t know anything about sensitive electronics and generally don\'t care.I have a 2ft x 2ft x 1ft monster of a rig with 7 drives (6 Sata, 1 NVMe) running on a PCIe power swap controller, a 3090 24GB, Capellix Elite 360mm rad etc etc....you get the idea.I ALSO HAVE an 8TB N300 NAS running constantly in one of my bays as a tranfer/backup drive...I have for over 2 years now (and I also had to have that replaced once first), I deleted and recovered the entire partition at one point picking the wrong one by means of a typo and I\'ve been programming and repairing PCs for almost 30yrs now.With that all out of the way, we can safely say I know how to handle electronics...and I\'ve gotten 2 DOA Toshiba drives from 3rd party sellers off Amazon in about 2 months.UPDATE:I can\'t speak for the first drive, but the second drive, the Toshiba NAS Pro 4TB this review is for turned out to be working fine.Seems it was my PCI Drive Power Swap mentioned above had partially melted glue that held the Sata connector on the board.Ironically this only happeed with NEW Toshiba drives (I.E. the ""Pro"" series), I had no issue on the same cables with my older 8TB NAS drive.I\'m ""guessing"" it has to do with a new design, likely that saved the drive from any long term damage by powering off, my Toshiba P300 I replaced with this was not so lucky heh.I\'m leaving the rest of the review so people know what to look for that may tell them its a power failure...as well as how much hassle it was due to a 3rd party seller, although they followed up with me to the end, no form of resolution was follored through, although they agreed to one.END UPDATEIts gotten so bad I absolutely refuse to return it without them shipping another out so I can clone my data over first, which I\'m still waiting for a response now.It works, it doesn\'t, it boots and stays running for an hour...then won\'t boot 4 times in a row.I switch both connection to others that always work perfectly fine, its 50/50 I can even load the drive. I\'ve tried setting it to hotswap in my BIOS, I\'ve tried connecting it by itself with nothing else which of course is when it decides to work for a short time, then poof, Windows BSOD and won\'t boot again.It has a lower voltage needed than my N300 8TB drive and I\'ve swapped them and the sata/power cables running them with no luck.I have 5 other Toshiba drives--this was actually a larger replacement for a P300 that finally went after almost 6 years. I am loyal to Toshiba, the Warranty and replacement OR refund if no similar product can be shipped is incredible, but I have the absolute worst luck buying PC parts off Amazon.I had high hopes when this arrived in a Newegg box, but alas...that just made it harder to reach the seller and get some sort of resolution.I recommend Toshiba drives, truly, what I can\'t recommend is buying them from a 3rd party off Amazon, at least if you buy direct you know your covered...frankly I\'m disappointed in the service I recieved when they couldn\'t reach the seller because of an incorrect phone number.Case closed, A to the Z, now refund me and send me one from Amazon at least...I can\'t say its the sellers fault it was damaged--Amazon needs to put some quality control in place or take a hand in any sensitive electronic because its just making them and Toshiba look bad at this point.I\'m giving it four stars because I have updated the reason of failure and knocking off a star for the lack of service resoution and I absolutely stand behind Toshibas products.I would buy the drive elsewhere or make sure you have the time to thoroughly test it before swapping your data over like I did and scrapping your old one.ESD, thats actually almost comical to be honest...if you can manage to destroy a drive with unintentionally ESD, I would actually pay to see the internals after the fact lol.If you believe that you shouldn\'t be buying a Hard Drive without a sales associate next to you...maybe not even then.', ""First, an important notice for all buyers of these internal hard drives:These internal drives were really meant for use by OEM manufacturers or for those (e.g., professional builders of custom computers) who know and follow proper ESD-protection procedures when handling these drives. If you handle or touch them improperly, you can cause ESD damage to the internal circuits of these drives, rendering them inoperable immediately or some time later (known as latent damage, which is an important cause of reduced reliability of the drives), depending on the nature of the damage you caused.You cannot handle and touch them like other consumer electronic devices. You need to follow proper ESD-protection procedures. Since, by default,  these drives were intended to be used by those know how to properly handle them, the manufacturers do not typically include ESD warnings other than the anti-static bags that they come packaged in.The insidious nature of ESD means that the damage can manifest itself in many different ways, so no two ESD-damaged drives will malfunction in identical ways.

several of these same drives , they are perfect size , performance vs price , 7200 rpm large sizei have 2 ps4s ( very first model and second model ps4s og ps4s ) that have 6 terabytes tochiba x300 in both of them with these same drives INTERNAL( links to all products i used on amazon for my ps4s at the bottom of review )you get esata to sata cable and plug in the sata part of the cable into the internal ps4 portroute the cableout the front of the hard drive cage over the cage route the cable to the back of the ps4 and out the coner vent ,use electric tape and tape the cable down firmly , i used alotta tape here and it came out perfect nice and tight , cut the corner and second vent next to it to create one big vent and route the cable out that vent , then put hard drive cover on , the hardest part of this , is getting the sata cable onto the sata port of the ps4 , my very first time on both my ps4s i got it first time with needle nose pliersmine has been perfect ever since , however my son at 12 years old was not as careful and yanked his sata cable out somehow , upon trying to put sata cable back on i could not and wound up cutting his cage just so i could get the cable on wich i did and after that its worked fine , this mod to the ps4 works perfect but use common sense and do not yank the sata cable on the back , really i have no clue how he even did that as i had it done perfect so it could not movenow you have a ps4 with a sata cable coming out the back , now go on amazon and buy the rosewill external hard drive housing with esata port , it also has a fan on top a circle vent and on the front has blue led light , like the whole front of this housing lights up blue ( looks really good ontop the ps4 ) its always on amazon i think i paid 30 bucks for it search rosewill external hard drive housing esata and you will find ittake your x300 Toshiba hard drive and put it inside the housing , then plug esata part of the sata to esata cable into the back of the external housing ,sit the external housing on top of your ps4 on the side that the hard drive bay is ,now you have a ps4 with 6 terabytes of internal storagei never use rest mode , im sure you can but i never use it so i do not even know if it worksevery time you shut off your psd4 you must shut off your hard drive ( ON OFF WITH ON THE EXTERNAL HOUSING power switch )if you leave the hard drive external housing on after you shut off your ps4 when you come back if you turn on your ps4 it will show black screen , this is because you left the hard drive on with no source and the hard drive went into hibernation stateso to fix this plug in controller turn off ps4 , or just hit the power button and turn off ps4 , then turn on the hard drive then turn on ps4every time you must turn hard drive on first then ps4 , after a few times of getting a black screen that says ps4 can not detect hard drive and shutting off your ps4 then turning on the hard drive then turning on the ps4 and seeing all is good , after a few times of this you get used to it and it is a none issuei did this before the external update that gave everyone the ability to use external hard drives on ps4 , but i still think this uis the best way to go because now you can also get external storage and eventually have way over 6 terabytes and also several drives all because you got a massive internal storagethis drive i am buying i am buying three 4 terabyte x300 Toshiba for 3 different gaming computers as now we went to PC and will in the future only use our ps4s for Sony exclusives ( they are still tho both filled with 6 terabytes of games on both of them from before we went to PC gaming )the benefit to this is massive storage , i can not explain how awesome it is to turn on your ps4 and have 6 terabytes of games ready to play , i am in the process of doing the same but on a much larger scale to all three of my family's gaming computers with 20 terabytes of games on each PC , and i will be doing it all with these Toshiba x300 drives because the cost per performance and size is perfectthese drives are perfect i gave them 5 stars because the drives are perfect price for what your getting and they are 7200 rpm , these are really all you need for gaming on PC or consolethese drives where not shipped very well tho , i did not take a star off because they are great drives and its not Toshiba fault , its i think dells fault , as amazon says on the ship order tab that they where shipped by dell even tho i bought them from amazon( newegg sells these same drives when i bought them from newegg in the past as i have many of these same drives they where very well packaged , i purchased here on amazon because i was already buying other things this time )they where not damaged in any way , but they where packed with no bubble anything no protection in shipping just three hard drives thrown into a boxthey could of easily bounced around and got damaged , i have worked warehouses my whole life and not one place i have ever worked at would accept that type of job performance , whoever packages and picked my order obviously did not care weather the product reached its destination safelyluckily they did reach me safely undamaged , the outside box was undamaged and the contents inside the three hard drives where undamaged , but it was packages with no regard for customers merchandise , they basically put 6 inches tall of product into a 10 inch tall box with nothing to pad it nothing to make sure it stays safe during shipping , whoever picked my order did not carei have read comments on newegg and here on amazon that Toshiba warranty , like if the drive messes up and you need a replacement , they give you a choice of gift card ( value you paid i am assuming ) or replacement and usually they do not have a replacement to give you so they give you gift card , i have not had to go thru this yet as all my drives are in perfect working order , but i am mentioning it because it sounds like a huge hassle to deal with as others have said , i read a comment where the guy did not get reimbursed till like 6 weeks later , that would irritate me bad , luckily i have not had to deal with that , out of 6 drives all are working fine , i still have 2 i have not installed yet , imma install them tomorrow on my PC and my wife's PCthis the housing i used on both ps4s

I used one as a library of my important files and the second was a backup of the first.  I did not set up as raid, I simply made a copy of the drive once a month.  So, while one drive was used constantly, the other was only written to eight times!!!!  Yes, I wrote a lot of information, but these drives should not fail in less than one year, but both failed within one month of each other.  The used one started making a loud clicking noise all the time.  I imediately backed it up to the second one, and ordered replacements.  The first drive failed while I waited for the replacement drives.  As soon as the replacement drives showed up I copied the files from the backup drive, and then attempted to format the backup and use it for movie storage only.  I copied all my movie files to it, but when it was done, only about half the files existed on the reformatted drive.  I tried twice more to copy files to it, but it failed to have the files after completion yet there was no error report of files failing to transfer.  So, I did a low level format (complete) but it failed to complete the formatting.  I attempted it multiple times and it still failed.  I contacted Toshiba support via their website.  I got no response.  I tried again, still no reply about my failing hard drives, so I called, I was told I would need to send photos of the drives before I could get an RMA#.  They emailed me the required information form,  I sent the photos and the requested information and waited, and waited, and waited, after a week of no confirmation and no RMA#, I called and spoke to someone who stated that they could see my emails, as they go to a pool of technicians, but there was no response, I started getting upset as the person on the line acted like it was no big deal, and it wasn't his job anyway, and he hung up on me.  He did send me an email with the RMA numbers, so I shipped the drives off, insured through USPS.  The day USPS stated that the drives had arrived, I tried looking up the RMA numbers on their website.  The first one showed not received yet, and the second showed invalid.  There was no second RMA number matching mine.  I emailed the person who had sent the RMA numbers and asked if he could look into why the second one was coming up invalid when they hadn't even received the drives yet.  I, of course, GOT NO RESPONSE.  Then I get an email from the technician telling me that the drive with the invalid RMA number was received damaged.  They kindly offered to destroy the drive, without replacement, and they sent a photo of the damage, (See Photo) claiming it arrived that way, on the RMA that was invalid.  I replied that I had photos of the drives (Per their request) and that because of the way they had handled it so far, I had insured the drives, so if it was broken, I needed it returned as such, they did not respond.  The next day I get another email from the same tech telling me that the drive was broken and did I want Toshiba to destroy it or send it back, I replied to his email, included some verbal admonishments as to his ability to read, and again, got no response.  The next day I again get an email telling me the drive is damaged, and … I called and asked to speak to the idiot.  He was unavailable, but would call me back.  He did so and in the conversation he admitted he had received my emails, but that I had not requested that the drives be returned, but his supervisor had told him that they couldn't actually return my drive.  WOW!!!!  I forwarded him my prior emails, along with highlighting on the part where I requested the drives be returned, the first line of the first email I sent him, and well down in the text of the second one and I asked to speak to a supervisor, he stated they were all gone for the weekend, and unavailable.  I asked him to have them call me on Monday, of course they did not.  I then went online and looked up every possible email for anyone at Toshiba.com, including from their website and I forwarded the entire conversation, situation and emails I had sent and received, including one which had all my requests for returning the drive as responses from the technician, proving he had received my requests, multiple times, and he replied multiple times.  Again, I heard nothing from anyone at Toshiba.  I gave it a week and finally received an email that they were returning my drive.  I received it today, and it is broken as they claimed, but it was not broken before I sent it and the break is fresh.  Also, how does the breaking of a piece of plastic cause a drive to start making loud clicking noise, it was the main drive they claimed was broken.  The drive was installed ONCE, and uninstalled ONCE.  I am a programmer from the 1970's and have built hundreds of computers.  There is no way I missed a broken harness guide installing it or removing it.  All this over a $160 drive that should have lasted two years minimum (Actual Warranty).  The fact that both failed in less than a year, and one failed after only being written to eight times, and never read from until replacement!!!!  I may have simply been unlucky enough to get two bad drives at once, but, Toshiba's handling of the entire process has turned me off of ever purchasing their products again, and I have always told people to buy their products because they were reliable.  NEVER AGAIN.  TOSHIBA SUCKS FOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT.  These drives are obviously a problem or they wouldn't have worked so hard to not have to replace another one.  I have purchase at least $3000 worth of Toshiba products in 2018.  I have been using their products, happily for over twenty years, and truly this is the FIRST time I have had to contact them about one of their products failing outright.  But, I will not deal with their support people ever again, which means I will never purchase one of their products again, even though they have a 95% dependability history with me.  I do not want to have to jump through such loops again.  No more Toshiba TVs, I have 3, no more Toshiba Laptops, Bought One in October for my Great-Great-Niece.  I have always bought Toshiba's for my Daughter who is now 25 and buys her own stuff.  No more Toshiba hard drives, I purchased no less than five on Amazon in 2018.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!"", 'I use this drive for storing and accessing all of my sound banks from Native Instruments, East West, BFD, IK Multimedia and others. It is blinding fast and so far has been super reliable.', ""I am a Mac user, so what I'm about to say probably does not apply to a PC. I just bought a new 2017 iMac and it is loaded with the fastest 4.2 GHz i7 quad-core processor, a 3TB Fusion drive, and 64GB of RAM, running Sierra. Speed should not be an issue. I bought a pair of these drives to store some files that I prefer to keep in encrypted .DMG containers. Disk Utility makes it easy to create such containers. When you do the math, you realize that even when writing at USB3 speeds, about 100 MB/sec, it will take about 24 hours to fill up an entire 8TB X300 drive with this encrypted container. After the first drive was written to, I found something that did not seem right: when you enter the password and open the container, all writes to it are dog slow, as in 5-10 MB/sec. That's not right.At first I attributed the problem to the drive, so I opened the second X300 drive and repeated the operation, but found the same slow write speed to the opened container. One drive bad, okay. Two drives bad? No. Using Disk Utility's First Aid showed no signs of issues with the drive. Any other writes to the drive to non-encrypted folders, or a non-encrypted container, and the speeds are normal. Reads from either encrypted or non-encrypted folders/containers are also normal-fast.Some internet research revealed that this problem has been going on for many years and several releases of OSX. It would appear that the slow write speeds to an encrypted container are not a function of any hard drive, but a bug inside Mac OSX. The same internet research found neither a solution nor a workaround. I worked at it and found that there IS a workaround, although it's not fast or easy to do. What you do is find yourself an old Mac that runs Snow Leopard (10.6.8). I have an old iMac that fits the bill, but unfortunately, if it runs Snow Leopard, it means that its ports are limited to either USB2 or Firewire800 (FW800). Writing to these big-capacity drives when your speed is limited to 20-40 MB/sec is going to be SLOW. I was able to put the drives in a FW800 enclosure to get a faster speed than USB2.You now use Disk Utility in the Snow Leopard-based Mac and create the encrypted container on the X300 drive using it. It took about 2.6 days to complete. When complete, you then move the drive over to your newer, fast Mac and connect it up through USB3. When you open the encrypted container, created in Snow Leopard, mount it on the Sierra-based Mac desktop, you find that write speeds are finally what you expect, about 100 MB/sec. I think I'm the first guy to find a viable workaround for this issue. It verifies that the issue is a bug buried in later versions of OSX, which according to some people goes back all the way to Lion (10.7). It's an Apple bug. The observed slow write speeds to the encrypted X300 drive is NOT a problem with the hard drive.Additionally, once you are running on the new fast Mac, you can copy this encrypted container to any other drive (the second X300 drive that I bought), and when you open it, the write speeds are again fast as they should be. In other words, it is just the CREATION of the encrypted container that is the bug in Apple's later Disk Utility code. Formatting, reading, and copying are just fine. How you manage to slap Apple's face to get them to fix it, I don't know.Sorry for the long story, but the slow write speeds to the encrypted container would have been a deal breaker for me. I would have wrapped up the drives and sent them back, blaming the hard drive for what turned out to be a Mac OSX bug. I have found that these drives perform as well as you would expect them to with no slowness or other oddness that I first attributed to the possibility that these drives might use SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording) that is notorious for slow writing speeds.  Toshiba won't tell anyone what technology is inside their drives, but industry insiders swear it is not SMR. Reads and writes now operate reasonably fast on USB3 for my needs, regardless of whether there is encryption involved or not.  You just have to be careful not to use any OSX version of 10.7 or higher to create an encrypted container."", 'I purchased a Toshiba X300 6TB drive to replace an old 2 TB Western Digital.  Price was good and was partially a Christmas gift (as I had a left over balance from gift cards) which made it a much easier decision to purchase.I wanted to use the entire drive as 1 partition as it would replace my data drive ""D"" (while I have an SSD as my boot drive ""C"").  That exercise was an education for me.  While my motherboard\'s BIOS did support the larger drive (lucky!), the old partition would not expand the ""Primary"" partition to 6 TB (actually 5.458 formated).  I ended up downloading a free partitioning program (Macrorit Disk Partition Free Edition 4.0.0; you can use whatever) and setting the partition type to ""GPT(Data Partion)"".  This would be non-bootable but that\'s fine since I had an SSD as my boot drive.  After that, a disk-to-disk transfer with CloneZilla and expanded the NTFS system to the full capacity of the drive (forgot what I used to expand; either GPartition or Macrorit; you have choices at that point).  After that, verified the drive was running in Windows 7, and used the native Windows 7 disk manager (R-click Computer icon->Manage->Storage->Disk Management) and changed the drive letters around (my old drive became an Archival drive on a random drive letter, while my new Toshiba became the new drive D).  I restarted my computer just in case and everything came up fine.  (Oh btw, I should mention I used CloneZilla to clone my boot drive to my old data drive, so I could just image back if any of these chances went south.)  The bottom line is that everything came up fine.  Of course, I didn\'t know about the GPT partition type before hand so I actually cloned my data drive twice :(.And now...about the performance.  I noticed two things very quickly.  1) This 7200 RPM drive is noticeably faster than a 5400 RPM drive.  I transcode school basketball games from my camcorder to a standard .mp4 format.  Completion/writing is quicker.  2) This drive is noisy compared to my old silent WD drive.  The loudness?  Image listening to someone pouring out a box of cereal while you hold your hands over your ears.  It kind of sounds like that.  My other half thought it was raining outside but after a few days she realized it was the computer.  But in it\'s defense, it doesn\'t always sound like that.  In fact, I was surprised that the idle spin noise was just about as quiet as the old drive (given that it\'s faster that\'s something).  I\'ve minimized the noise by defragmenting the drive (I used Smart Defrag 5), plus I don\'t do massive access to it that often.  My theory is that if the drive doesn\'t have to seek that often, then it will be quieter.  (Side note: I just ran a test by copying over a 1.6 GB file to it and it was pretty quiet.)  It also helps that my computer is on the floor and not on the desk.Overall I\'m pretty happy with the drive.  For the price and speed as compared to others in its class, I believe it to be a good buy.', 'So is this drive worth it? Depends....I got 5 years and 5 months out of it. If that is worth it, go for it. If not, look elsewhere.']"

Might be a refurbished drive as the data suggests a drive that's nearing the end of its life span. Otherwise this would be a defective product."", ""Firstly the drive itself. In my experience you'll nearly always get a slight hum / vibration when a HDD spins at anything over 5400rpm, as far as 7200rpm drives go, this is a quiet one. How your drive is attached to your chassis / case will have a big bearing on what reaches your ear.The wake up times are very good when compared to a Caviar Green, so it's good for an everyday storage drive for say downloads etc as there's very little pause when waking after the drive been put to sleep to save power etc, say 1-2 seconds compared to say 6 with a Green. All in all, I definitely recommend this drive, especially for the price. Obviously the only thing that matches an SSD is an SSD but as far as transfer speeds go, I was getting around 120-130mb/sec sustained when moving large files across internal mechanical drives.Now why only 3 stars? Well I went to register the drive and check the warranty. I'd had the drive about 2 days, ran the serial and it came back as having about 5 months remaining out of the 24 months you get with a new Blue drive! I queried this with Western Digital, they revealed what I already suspected... I had been sold a recertified drive. These are basically knackered drives that Western Digital then refurbish and put back out, usually for resellers to flog at a discounted rate. The fact they only give them 6 months warranty says allot. The fact that the seller puts them out as a new drive also says allot.So the moral is, make sure when buying that your drive is DISPATCHED FROM AND SOLD BY AMAZON themselves and not a third party seller. Even if it's fulfilled by Amazon it can still be sold by a third party.I returned the drive for a refund and purchased a new drive from Amazon themselves, this time with a full warranty. I have attached images showing the differences between the two drives. The most obvious being the difference in the stickers, the brand new drive has the Blue sticker, the recertified has a black sticker, but both have the same part number. There's also a shot of the faint 'Recertified' stamp that I missed when fitting (*face palm*) hopefully this review will help people avoid being fleeced by unscrupulous sellers charging the same for a refurbished unit with a dead warranty as a brand new unit with a 2 year warranty."", 'In 2015, I purchased the Western Digital 1TB WD Blue PC Internal Hard Drive, and wow; this workhorse is driving away like a champ even after all these years. How many products nowadays can you buy and genuinely expect them to still work over five years later?Although it\'s an HDD that may not compete with the speed of modern SSDs, it offers phenomenal storage capacity at an unbeatable price. With HDDs, you are granted solidity and reliability, always crucial elements in handling data. As it was said - ""Old is Gold."" But bear in mind, if speed and performance are your primal needs, then SSD could be preferable.The major bell ringer for me regarding the Western Digital 1TB HDD is the excellent value for money. This budget-friendly beef of storage is perfect for those looking to get an enormous bang for their buck.The drive still functions exceptionally well, six years post-purchase, without any hiccups. It also offers valuable features like Free Acronis True Image WD Edition cloning software which eases data migration.It\'s also important to note that the WD Blue PC Hard Drive boasts a Data Recovery Service feature.In terms of compatibility, it readily gels well with desktop systems, ensuring a seamless experience right through the installation and usage stages.Remember that it\'s painted in this excellent blue, stepping away from dull, conventional storage system shades.In conclusion, Western Digital Blue can be your long-lasting companion for those seeking a reasonably priced, hardy, and reliable hard drive. This 1TB workhorse of an industry deserves its five stars for dependability, capability, capacity, and cost-effectiveness.']"

Durch ihre hohe Qualität und diesehr guten Leistungsdaten hervorragend für den professionellen Dauergebrauch geeignet.Eine überzeugende Kaufempfehlung !', 'Good seller. Updated on delivery and integrity.', 'My son came to me with his new Acer Nitro 5 laptop and said it was ridiculously slow... I work in IT and this statement made so sense since we over bought what he needed and it should last for years, this was 3 months after purchase. A quick look through the laptop found the internal NVMe drive had 0 available bytes, so we removed a game and opened up 120GB and ordered this drive for game storage as his laptop has a 2.5 SATA hard drive expansion slot, which we would just get a large HDD to use for game installs.Drive came in bulk packaging, vacuum sealed in an anti-static bag with those little black plastic molded ""feet"" on either end, in a single-wall box... No additional packaging or double boxing, but it arrived intact. I could see if your delivery carrier was a little ""rougher"" with packages, this might be a problem for this drive as it was packaged, but mine arrived with no issues.Installation was simple... Acer includes the SATA cable and mounting screws for the drive, which is good because this drive came with nothing extra, no screws or anything else. Installation took about 10 minutes total, most of the time getting the back cover off. After physically installing the drive and putting everything back together the PC booted right up and recognized the drive. This drive doesn\'t include any software (you don\'t really need it), so we went into Disk Management and formatted the drive as a single volume, and created a few directories on it to match the main drive so when an app or game was installed my son only had to change the C: to a D: in the installer and everything would work as expected. He has since installed a couple games without issue.The drive works well... It isn\'t the speediest thing, especially when you are used to an SSD, but for storage or applications that are not super disk intensive it works fine. Performance is good and there is no noticeably impact to battery life or increased heat dissipation. We have used Toshiba laptop drives in the past and they have been very good options in the past, so I expect no issues and good longevity.', 'Very happy with this harddrive.', ""I have a HP Elitedesk 800 G1. Originally I bought it to be low coast emulation PC, but it ended up being my default PC. Between o;d retro games, Steams sales, free game offerings and cheap deals from other places, I had to add hard drives. I started with a full size 1TB Mechanical Toshiba drive, I would have switched to an SSD but they are just too expensive for a comparable size and the computer booted in under a minute anyway so speed wasn't a concern I added a second, and it was obvious I would not have room for a 3rd full size drive so I got a 2tb laptop drive... and it was actually faster! Sooo when that drive filled I should have been sensible and got an external 4th drive, but because I didn't want to use up my USBs, I decided to get another 2tb laptop drive and squeezed it into the last remaining gap I could find, works just fine apparently!"", 'Toshiba L200 1TB Mobile 2.5 Inch SATA 5400rpm Internal Hard Drive\nI bought this drive to use as a second drive in my laptop through the use of a hard drive caddy that replaces my DVD drive since I rare to never need the DVD and is a very easy swap if I do need it. I purchased this drive around the early part of Dec and thus far has performed very well. The extra storage is nice to have and since the main drive is coming up on the 5 year mark I have moved much of what was on the main to this drive. I have externals as well but is much nicer to just have it on board and not using up a USB port and being just another thing to worry about.This drive is very quiet, transfers between drives are quite fast. Time will tell of course as my computer is on 24/7 except a once a week reboot or install reboot.I recommend this drive as a cheap storage drive or even a main drive replacement if the 5400 RPM is of no concern to you. (my main is 5400 as are most included in new laptops unless you pay extra) Any drive 500 gig or more I highly recommend partitioning. A search for partitioning software will give plenty of easy to use options. On my main I have a partition just for Windows and I store on the others. This way if windows ever needs to be reinstalled fresh you will not lose anything on the other partitions so long as reinstalling to same partition Windows was on in the first place.', ""Purchased this to replace a Seagate 2tb that I had installed a little over 12 months ago on PS4.The Seagate started freezing and looping the PS4 in safe mode.

Mejor rendimiento en lectura que en escritura.- WD Purple: Pensados para equipos de video-vigilancia y grabación de video, equipos que están encendidos 24/7; rendimiento medio y mayor rendimiento de escritura que de lectura.- WD Blue: son discos todo-terreno, para todo tipo de usos no específicos, su rendimiento varía en función de las RPMs que use (desde 5.400 hasta 7.200).- WD Gold: pensados para servidores en centros de datos, muy caros.En mi caso, compré este disco para colocarlo en una carcasa externa USB y hacer en él las copias de seguridad. Los modelos Blue son discos mediocres, de uso doméstico general. Rinden algo menos que los Black por ejemplo, al ser de 5.400 RPM en vez de a 7.200, pero en mi caso no es tan importante el rendimiento como la durabilidad del disco, pues es para copias de seguridad.

The drives are reasonably quiet, a bit quieter than my WD Red drives, but they do run a couple of degrees warmer than the Reds at idle and under load.  Both sets of drives are in the exact same type of QNAP enclosure and the enclosures are sitting right next to each other, so ambient conditions are about the same.  I am a fan of Seagate drives and was eager to test out the new Ironwolf drives, as all of my other NAS-specific drives are Western Digital and HGST.Only negative, which I will not penalize the drive itself for, was the horrible packaging job.  These drives were sold by and shipped from Amazon directly, and considering the huge array of electronic equipment Amazon sells, they should know better.  Drives were laying in the bottom of a fairly large cardboard box with a couple airbags loosely strewn on top.  The things likely got banged around a fair bit during shipping.  There were no shockproof endocarps in a box specifically designed for a hard drive (my Western Digitals and every other Seagate I have received had those), and not sure why Seagate/Amazon would think it's OK to transport drives like this.  I have read reviews on this issue before with drives being shipped in thinly padded envelopes, and thought nah, that could never happen to me!  Very disappointed.  Fortunately, I didn't see any signs of damage and the drives are performing as intended, so we'll see and hope there are no future issues.See attached photos.  Also included one of a *correctly* packaged Western Digital drive."", ""QUICK SUMMARY:  Nice replacement for an older model 2GB Seagate IronWolf  in my Windows 2012 Server.BACKGROUND:  My four-bay Windows Storage Server 2012 came with four 2TB Seagate IronWolf drives.  Earlier this year, I started having weird, fluctuating, slow data transfers between my laptop and my server.  Thanks to CrystalDisk freeware, I realized one of the 2TB drives had a 'Caution' state -- bad sectors.  I didn't realize that the bad sectors would have such a profound affect on server performance.The new 2TB IronWolf drive here is one model newer than what is in my server, but it installed and works just fine, restoring the performance to my server.  Adding it was a snap.  I inserted it into an external dock, added it to the storage pool, then retired the bad drive which forced all the good data off the bad drive onto the new drive (I didn't have enough storage capacity to do this differently).  It took about 24 hours to retire the old drive.  Once that was retired, I removed it from the bad and inserted this drive -- which now had all the data on it -- into the same bay slot.  Rebooted the server and all was fine.CONCLUSION:  I'm a Western Digital fan, but this was a suitable replacement for an all-Seagate Windows server."", 'My grandson connect to his computer.', ""Installed 5 of these (2 TB each)  into a 5-bay Mobius RAID drive enclosure and they seem to work great.  I have them in RAID 5 - performance seems great, no noise at all.  They are very quiet - so quiet I never hear them at all.  If the LEDs didn't flash on the enclosure when the drives are in use, I would never know anything was happening.  I don't understand any of the negative reviews - I guess those people were just unlucky.  The real test though will be how long they last.  With RAID 5 I can only lose one at a time and still recover - if I lose two or more at once, I'm totally screwed.  So far I've only been using them to store backups and movies and it seems to handle activities both very well.  I'm very happy with my purchase - I got them on sale for just $71 each.  Normally I don't spend the extra money for NAS or Enterprise class drives but the drive enclosure said to only use those types of drives so I did - and so far it has worked out great."", 'Use these as replacement drives in my NAS (Network Attached Storage). What a difference they make in access speed and peace of mind. The drives that came with my server were not intended to be left on continually. When the original drives failed I was about to purchase another NAS until I did some research and found out that most of the NAS Servers do not use enterprise drives they use desktop drives to keep the cost down. The NAS Enclosure was still good so this was the best option. The two drives cost lest than a complete NAS and I now have drives that were design for server use and not home use.I have another NAS that was twice the cost of the one that failed and it uses the same desktop drives that was in the other NAS. I am know saving my coins to purchase two more of these drives as replacement before that NAS fail.', ""Expérience décevante sur ce DD.

I am running eight cameras in a Samsung/Wisenet system. This system came with 1 TB and four cameras. But after I added four more to the system the 1 TB was no longer sufficient. I purchased this for terabyte drive, because it was the exact model of my 1 TB.This Is a 3.5 drive, so be sure that it will fit your console or whatever you are placing it in. It's important that people know this is not a standard drive and is made for surveillance cameras, or something that is access to an overridden on a regular basis. Unlike a standard hard drive in your PC that has correction control most of these drives for the surveillance systems do not have correction. Meaning once it copies the data there is no verification that the data was copied correctly. Why this is not usually a problem on a system is a good hard drive and a smooth running operating system it could result in data loss. That is why it is advised to buy a surveillance hard drive, something that is specifically made to run off and and to keep copying the files without correction.I found a hard drive to be very efficient, and for some reason works faster than my 1 TB of the same maker and brand. It is also quieter than the 1 TB that my system came with. In fact the fan on my DVR makes more noise than a hard drive does and I have a quiet fan.Keep in mind why this may fit the majority of DVR's that are out there formats do vary from Linux, Windows or their own proprietary software. And formatting the drive may vary. Generally speaking most surveillance hard drives are compatible with buried systems but keep in mind that your hard drive may need to be formatted either by the DVR system, or possibly externally done to make it compatible with your DVR. I have seen more people have problems with DVR hard drives when they do not realize that the system they are installing in a have a proprietary format system and may not be compatible with the drive you purchased. That is why it's important to find a hard drive that has a wide range of compatibility as well is something that's been around for a while. Your surveillance cameras are expensive investment for most people. And the data that we have on these hard drives is why they are valuable. Anybody can purchase DVR, and cameras are pretty similar across the board improving with each year. But hard drives are the core operating systems bread-and-butter of you will. When you need the hard drive to work you need to work, this is barely second two cameras being of high quality because you have a high-quality camera but if your hard drive is a standard drive or of a low quality you may have issues. So if you've invested the camera system it's wise to buy a compatible high-quality hard drive that is built for surveillance systems and has a decent warranty.Overview: I highly recommend the drive. At this time it installed quickly, was able to format on my DVR with no issues. Is extremely quiet and accessing data to copy to another hard drive, or to use for fast search was extremely fast with no issues whatsoever. Check on Amazon as the the prices vary from size to size. The 4 TB seemed to be about the best deal because it was slightly more than the 1 2 and 3 TB, but considerably less than the 6 TB, making this the best choice and value. Running at 4K, my cameras have enough room to record for approximately 2 1/2 to 3 weeks. Depending on whether you have motion or straight recording this can vary and your quality of cameras. I am guessing if you have a 1080 P camera system this may last you up to a month possibly depending on your settings."", 'I bought this in April of 2017 for a 4K Lorex Security camera system and it died in May 2023.I guess 6 years is a good run for a drive in a security camera system.There are much newer drives on the market now so this time I tried WD 8tb model.', 'ich habe die Festplatte als Erweiterung für meinen Reolink NVR gekauft und sie macht was sie soll.

Avendo espressamente indicato di lanciarlo sull\'intero disco ha controllato tutti i blocchi del disco (Dal blocco 0 al blocco 976762583).Il seconto test l\'ho eseguito con smartctl perché alcuni HDD hanno la possibilità di rimappare al volo i blocchi rovinati e non darne quindi evidenza durante test quali badblocks, tuttavia essi sono visibili nelle informazioni S.M.A.R.T. Ho quindi provveduto ad effettuare due test, quello ""Conveyance"" che valuta i problemi legati al trasporto e quello ""Short"" che fa una verifica di integrità veloce ma ha comunque un\'alta probabilità di rilevare gli errori pur non esaminando la superficie completa (azione già eseguita con badblocks).Ho quindi provveduto a controllare la sezione SMART del disco, di cui riporto l\'output in calce e allego alcuni screenshot.Nessun test ha riportato errori e nessun settore è stato rimappato, ossia la superficie del disco è perfettamente integra così come le prestazioni.Inoltre il disco è perfettamente nuovo: le 19 ore di attività sono state tutte spese per i test ed è l\'effetivo tempo trascorso da quando l\'ho montato ad ora, l\'unica cosa che non torna sono i 3 cicli di alimentazione (Power Cycle), ma ritengo siano imputabili a dei controlli interni della casa costruttrice.Concludo quindi dicendo che, almeno nel mio caso ed almeno per ora, ho ricevuto un ottimo disco: silenzioso, con una perfetta ed integra superficie, non usato in precedenza.Aggiungo che è perfettamente compatibile con Linux (attuamente Linux MINT 17.2 Cinmmanon) e le principali utility di controllo e monitoraggio dei dischi presenti in quest\'ambiente.# sudo smartctl -iAl selftest /dev/sdasmartctl 6.2 2013-07-26 r3841 [x86_64-linux-3.16.0-38-generic] (local build)Copyright (C) 2002-13, Bruce Allen, Christian Franke, [...]=== START OF INFORMATION SECTION ===Model Family:  Western Digital Red (AF)Device Model:  WDC WD10EFRX-68FYTN0Serial Number:  WD-WCC4J4TY7F0RLU WWN Device Id: 5 0014ee 20c0ee683Firmware Version: 82.00A82User Capacity:  1.000.204.886.016 bytes [1,00 TB]Sector Sizes:  512 bytes logical, 4096 bytes physicalRotation Rate:  5400 rpmDevice is:  In smartctl database [for details use: -P show]ATA Version is:  ACS-2 (minor revision not indicated)SATA Version is:  SATA 3.0, 6.0 Gb/s (current: 3.0 Gb/s)Local Time is:  Fri Sep 18 18:17:50 2015 CESTSMART support is: Available - device has SMART capability.SMART support is: Enabled=== START OF READ SMART DATA SECTION ===SMART Attributes Data Structure revision number: 16Vendor Specific SMART Attributes with Thresholds:ID# ATTRIBUTE_NAME  FLAG  VALUE WORST THRESH TYPE  UPDATED  WHEN_FAILED RAW_VALUE  1 Raw_Read_Error_Rate  0x002f  200  200  051  Pre-fail  Always  -  0  3 Spin_Up_Time  0x0027  100  253  021  Pre-fail  Always  -  0  4 Start_Stop_Count  0x0032  100  100  000  Old_age  Always  -  3  5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct  0x0033  200  200  140  Pre-fail  Always  -  0  7 Seek_Error_Rate  0x002e  200  200  000  Old_age  Always  -  0  9 Power_On_Hours  0x0032  100  100  000  Old_age  Always  -  19 10 Spin_Retry_Count  0x0032  100  253  000  Old_age  Always  -  0 11 Calibration_Retry_Count 0x0032  100  253  000  Old_age  Always  -  0 12 Power_Cycle_Count  0x0032  100  100  000  Old_age  Always  -  3192 Power-Off_Retract_Count 0x0032  200  200  000  Old_age  Always  -  0193 Load_Cycle_Count  0x0032  200  200  000  Old_age  Always  -  2194 Temperature_Celsius  0x0022  107  106  000  Old_age  Always  -  36196 Reallocated_Event_Count 0x0032  200  200  000  Old_age  Always  -  0197 Current_Pending_Sector  0x0032  200  200  000  Old_age  Always  -  0198 Offline_Uncorrectable  0x0030  100  253  000  Old_age  Offline  -  0199 UDMA_CRC_Error_Count  0x0032  200  200  000  Old_age  Always  -  0200 Multi_Zone_Error_Rate  0x0008  100  253  000  Old_age  Offline  -  0SMART Self-test log structure revision number 1Num  Test_Description  Status  Remaining  LifeTime(hours)  LBA_of_first_error# 1  Short offline  Completed without error  00%  19  -# 2  Conveyance offline  Completed without error  00%  19  -', 'item is good !', ""Pros:Time Limited Error Recovery (TLER) for NAS/RAID usage.Price premium much lower/insignificant compared to what it used to be for NAS/RAID drives.Low power/Low temp.Cons:Warranty only 3 years (What happened to the 5-year warranties, WD?)I've seen failures in many drives from Seagate, WD, and other vendors in the past.  Hard drives fail.  Even SSDs fail sometimes.  That's why RAID configurations are so popular.  All versions of RAID configuration (except for RAID 0) introduce redundancy, such that if any single drive fails, no data need be lost.  Full redundancy can be regained by rebuilding the array with a replacement drive, theoretically keeping your data safe from single single points of hardware failure indefinitely.These NAS drives go one step further in that their behavior is optimized for a RAID environment.  In particular, Time Limited Error Recovery (TLER) allows them to rely on the redundancy built into the RAID controller and the overall array to handle the sorts of errors which will inevitably pop up at some point.  This reduces risks to data that can be caused by the behaviors of regular desktop disks, whose designers optimized them for environments where there is no RAID array backup.  I have been running RAID arrays regularly with desktop drives for over 6 years now, and it's been a pretty frequent occurrence where a drive would suddenly have to be rebuilt for no apparent reason.  In all likelihood, the reason was just a few bad sectors on the disk, which happens all the time.  The total failure rate of drives in a RAID has been a little above normal, but the total rebuild rate without total failure has been very high.  Read up on TLER, and you'll understand why that is expected behavior with desktop drives but not with NAS drives.  The total drive rebuild process is actually fairly risky to the integrity of the data, considering that in most configurations there is no redundancy while this is happening.  Therefore, making sure that a total rebuild doesn't happen unless necessary is a pretty good idea if you want to protect your data.  That's why I am upgrading my RAID arrays with these drives.In response to the reviewer who complained that the WDIDLE3 issue affects these drives:I just bought 4 of these drives in the 1TB version from Amazon.  (July 2015) All are model WD10EFRX.  I ran WDIDLE3 /R to read the current value of the timer on all four of them before connecting them to my RAID controller.  All four came set to 300 seconds (5 minutes.)This is a very reasonable value for most NAS/RAID usage, and certainly not as problematic as the 8 second timer that caused the well-known problems on some previous WD drives.  If you're using these to mount an OS drive or a drive in Windows, that 5 minute timer will probably never be invoked.  If you're using these on a 24/7 NAS or for non-OS storage in Linux like I do, that timer could lead to considerable power savings and reduced average temperatures, the latter of which will probably extend the life of the drive, not shorten it.The only way I could see the 300 second idle timer being a problem is if you're running a script that causes disk access every 6 minutes (or 10 or 15.)  i.e. if there's something that regularly forces spin-up right after the disk idle has gone into effect.  In that case, WDIDLE3 is included on the ultimate boot CD version 5.3.5 and can be used to disable the timer.  An idle timeout of 300 seconds is a pretty good feature in most cases, though.P.S. I have four more 3TB versions of this drive in transit for my NAS (the 1TBs were for my linux desktop) I will check the default WDIDLE3 values on them as well and post here if they prove to be different."", 'The WD 1TB WDBMMA0010HNC-NRSN drive kit fully met my expectations. I bought this drive to make a RAID1 pair. The drive performed well in my home-built FreeNAS server and provided better network storage performance than expected without any glitches or issues.When compared with 750GB WD Black drives in the same server the RED drives appeared to give slightly better perforance in NAS. Maybe the NAS specific firmware isn\'t just marketing.For more, read on...I wanted to build a NAS server for windows sharing, iSCSI, and nfs sharing. I had an old 1U ""pizza box"" server with a core 2 dual CPU and 4GB of ram available plus SATA II (300MBPS) channels. I got one of the WDBMMA0010HNC-NRSN WD-red drives through the vine programs and I bought a second through Amazon to build this NAS server.This drive is the retail package. It came in a nice box with 4 screws for mounting and a little bit of very fine printed material which I didn\'t bother to read. If a ""bare drive"" is fine and you don\'t care about packaging you might want to consider another listing for the 1TB WD Red drives which may be at a lower price for essentially the same thing.The software I used to drive the NAS is the excellent (especially at the price) FreeNAS server. It installs on a USB stick of at least 2GB. My old box had several USB 2.1 ports, so no problem. I configured the drives in a RAID 1 mirrored array using software RAID (instead of the FRAID (fake raid) built into the motherboard chip set.I first built the server with the WD Red drives first and ran some casual tests with windows shares and iSCSI. Using windows network or iSCSI I could saturate my Gigabit Ethernet with no problem. Performance was not an issue. They ran great and I had no complaints over several days of use. This isn\'t too surprising as many NAS boxes use little Intel Atom processors.Next I did a comparison by replacing the WD Red drives with WD Black 750GB drives I had on the shelf. I didn\'t see much difference but I felt that copies of lots of small/medium files completed more quickly with the Red drives. Maybe the caching algorithm of drive was just better tuned for NAS on the Red drives.A plus is the Time Limited Error Recovery (TLER) which is an important part of drives that are designed for RAID deployment. And having a drive that is designed to be on 24X7 is great.I\'ve switched back to the WD Red drives in my home-built NAS and I\'ll update this review as I live with the drives and report if there are any problems or notable excellence that stands out.Hope this bit of experience helps someone.Update: Dec 3, 2013I have recently gotten a\xa0\nBuffalo LinkStation 420 2TB 2-DriveNAS Personal Cloud Storage and Media Server\n\xa0In comparing my home built FreeNAS system (on old core duo hardware) with two of these drives to the LinkStation with 2 Toshiba drives was interesting. The FreeNAS system with the WD NAS drives (both systems with RAID1) ran about 50% faster than the LinkStation. You can check my review on the\xa0\nLinkStation\n\xa0for more information about my comparison.The LinkStation might be a better option to get diskless for a very low price use these drives inside it. The small footprint and low power make it an attractive option.Bottom-line it seems there may be something to the NAS specific firmware of these drives.', 'I\'m an HTPC enthusiast, and I\'m using this 10TB red drive in my Windows HTPC. I\'m running a 60GB SSD that holds my Windows 10 Pro OS, and then I have several other much larger internal drives that I store my audio/video files on. I would not recommend installing your operating system on a hard drive this large. I can only imagine the problems you\'d run into. I have been running these red drives as extra storage for awhile now, and they work extremely well for the intended purpose. I\'ve been replacing my smaller green drives as they have aged, and it\'s sad that WD doesnt make the green drives in these larger sizes. I\'ve only found the blue drives in sizes up to 6TB, so these larger red drives really fit the bill. They are the only 5200rpm WD drives I can find this large. If I run out of space in the main hard drive bay, I always install them in a 5.25 inch bay adapter, with at least a 80cm cooling fan. The main drive bay has a bigger fan of it\'s own. Make sure you have a fan blowing on these large drives. Without proper cooling they can reach temps of 50C+ really quick, and that can mean a loss of your precious files. I\'ve been collecting stuff for 25+ years and I cant risk a loss. So, I always do a full format on my new drives from the start. Its a great way to test a new drive before you start moving those files over to the new drive. A full format on a 10TB hard drive will take around 12.5 hours, so just let it run overnight. Your fully formatted size will be 9314GB under the Windows OS. If you dont understand that then search the internet, it\'s everywhere as to why. This drive was sold as a ""Plus"" drive, but I didnt see it printed anywhere on the drive as you can see. It doesnt matter to me though, because I will not being using it in a NAS system. I wasnt real happy about the manufactured date because it was almost a year ago. Would\'ve preferred a drive with a more recent date. Other than those 2 things, I havent run into any issues with these red drives. They function really well for extra storage in my HTPC, and I\'m going to buy more as the size increase. I sure do wish WD would make green or blue drives in these sizes, not sure why they dont.', ""Ich habe diesen Plattentype seit 2 Jahren im Einsatz.ZUERST DAS POSITIVE:Unhörbar leise, brummt und vibriert nicht.Für eine HHD schnelle Zugriffszeiten.Bleibt in 2 Fujitsu Rechnern - laufen im Normalbetrieb lüfterlos - auf 32°C kühl.

The old drive was a 1TB WD green from a few years ago. Since I figured I would give this drive a thorough run-through, I copied all the data using a USB 2 external adapter sitting on the floor on top of the bag the drive came in.It copied a few hundred thousand files of varying sizes in a couple of hours, mostly writing at about 31/MBs. I was surprised when it was running at how quiet the drive was and that it remained quite cool.After I pulled the old drive out of the server I compared the two, and this was actually lighter than the old 1TB green, I was surprised.In windows I ran a few crystal disk mark tests:The WD Red averaged 150 MB/s read and 130 MB/s write (Seq. 5 tests).The WD Green averaged 96 MB/s read and 88 MB/s write (Seq. 5 tests).Two Seagate 4TB drives (5900 RPM) in a Raid 1 averaged 143 MB/s read and 123 MB/s write (Seq. 5 tests).As the tests show, it outperformed the other drives, but the Seagates were definitely close and cost about 3/4 the price of the Red.I can't really speak for reliability since it has only been running a month, so my fingers are crossed for sure about that.My main problem with the huge storage drives available now is that it is pretty much mandatory to buy 2 in order to backup properly. You used to be able to get by backing up to tapes or discs, but it's just not feasible with something like a 4TB drive.Here's hoping that this drive has Western Digital reliability and treats me as well as the old Green drive did.""]"

Everyone's home RAID is likely an accident waiting to happen. If you're using regular consumer drives in a large array, there are some very simple (and likely) scenarios that can cause it to completely fail. I'm guilty of operating under this same false hope - I have an 8-drive array of 3TB WD Caviar Greens in a RAID-5. For those uninitiated, RAID-5 is where one drive worth of capacity is volunteered for use as parity data, which is distributed amongst all drives in the array. This trick allows for no data loss in the case where a single drive fails. The RAID controller can simply figure out the missing data by running the extra parity through the same formula that created it. This is called redundancy, but I propose that it's not.Since I'm also guilty here with my huge array of Caviar Greens, let me also say that every few weeks I have a batch job that reads *all* data from that array. Why on earth would I need to occasionally and repeatedly read 21TB of data from something that should already be super reliable? Here's the failure scenario for what might happen to me if I didn't: * Array starts off operating as normal, but drive 3 has a bad sector that cropped up a few months back. This has gone unnoticed because the bad sector was part of a rarely accessed file. * During operation, drive 1 encounters a new bad sector. * Since drive 1 is a consumer drive it goes into a retry loop, repeatedly attempting to read and correct the bad sector. * The RAID controller exceeds its timeout threshold waiting on drive 1 and marks it offline. * Array is now in degraded status with drive 1 marked as failed. * User replaces drive 1. RAID controller initiates rebuild using parity data from the other drives. * During rebuild, RAID controller encounters the bad sector on drive 3. * Since drive 3 is a consumer drive it goes into a retry loop, repeatedly attempting to read and correct the bad sector. * The RAID controller exceeds its timeout threshold waiting on drive 3 and marks it offline. * Rebuild fails.At this point the way forward varies from controller to controller, but the long and short of it is that the data is at extreme risk of loss. There are ways to get it all back (most likely without that one bad sector on drive 3), but none of them are particularly easy. Now you may be asking yourself how enterprises run huge RAIDs and don't see this sort of problem? The answer is Time Limited Error Recovery - where the hard drive assumes it is part of an array, assumes there is redundancy, and is not afraid to quickly tell the host controller that it just can't complete the current I/O request.Here's how that scenario would have played out if the drives implemented some form of TLER: * Array starts off operating as normal, but drive 3 has developed a bad sector several weeks ago. This went unnoticed because the bad sector was part of a rarely accessed file. * During operation, drive 1 encounters a new bad sector. * Drive 1 makes a few read attempts and then reports a CRC error to the RAID controller. * The RAID controller maps out the bad sector, locating it elsewhere on the drive. The missing sector is rebuilt using parity data from the other drives in the array. *Array continues normal operation, with the error added to its event log.The above scenario is what would play out with an Areca RAID controller (I've verified this personally). Other controllers may behave differently. A controller unable to do a bad sector remap might have just marked drive 1 as bad, but the key is that the rebuild would be much less likely to fail as drive 3 would not drop completely offline once the controller ran into the additional bad sector. The moral of this story is that typical consumer grade drives have data error timeouts that are far longer than the drive offline timeout of typical RAID controllers, and without some form of TLER, two bad sectors (totaling 1024 bytes) is all that's required to put multiple terabytes of data in grave danger.The Solution:The solution should be simple - just get some drives with TLER. The problem is that until now those were prohibitively expensive. Enterprise drives have all sorts of added features like accelerometers and pressure sensors to compensate for sliding in and out of a server rack while operating, as well as dealing with rapid pressure changes that take place when the server room door opens and the forced air circulation takes a quick detour. Those features just aren't needed in that home NAS sitting on your bookshelf. What *is* needed is a WD Caviar Green that has TLER, and Western Digital delivers that in their new Red drives.End quote and back to reviewer.I've got 5 of these in a\xa0\nSynology DiskStation 5-Bay (Diskless) Network Attached Storage (DS1512+)\n. It is really a sweet setup.The Synology software has a S.M.A.R.T. test that can do surface scans to detect bad sectors. I have their Quick Test check every disk daily and the Extended Test set to automatically run on each of the 5 disks every weekend. (The Extended Test takes about 5 hours per disk so I separate the tests by 12 hours.)"", 'Hard Disk Western Digital da 2TB per NAS, funziona molto bene, non si scalda e fa il suo lavoro senza intoppi. Metto 4 stelle anziché 5 perché avrei preferito che fosse imballato in modo più accurato, data la fragilità del prodotto, io sono stato fortunato perché funziona bene.', 'So, der Puls ist wieder unten. Lange habe ich mit mir gerungen, diese Platte anzuschaffen - ich brauchte mehr Platz in meinem NAS. Knapp zwei Jahre (14500 Stunden laut SMART, eine Platte hat EINEN CRC-Fehler gemeldet - das war\'s an Auffälligkeiten in zwei Jahren) haben zwei WD Red 2TB\xa0\nWestern Digital WD20EFRX Red 2TB Interne Festplatte für NAS-Storage (8,9 cm (3,5 Zoll), 5400rpm, SATA III)\n\xa0hier klaglos und unauffällig ihren Dienst im RAID 1 getan, warum also keine neuen aus der Serie...Die bisherigen Rezensionen haben mich allerdings stutzig gemacht, von auffällig vielen Problemen war die Rede, hauptsächlich allerdings in QNAP-Geräten.Also, ich habe ein Synology-NAS\xa0\nSynology DiskStation DS213+ NAS-Server (2x1GHz, 512MB RAM, 2-Bay, SATA II, 2x USB 3.0)\n\xa0und ich bestelle bei Amazon - was soll mir passieren?!? Wenn doch Fehler auftreten sollten, ist Amazon da erfreulich problemlos.Erstmal sollte nur eine Platte her, die soll problemlos laufen, erst dann kaufe ich eine zweite. Die Lieferung mit Amazon Prime hat vier Tage gebraucht - naja. Aber die Platte kam an. Im Karton hat sich allerdings eine Menge bewegt, an Füllmaterial hat der Kollege im Versand nämlich ganz gut gespart! Die Platte kam zusätzlich in der Original-WD-Kunststoffverpackung und darin im Antistatikbeutel eingeschweißt.Nach einer kurzen Akklimatisierungsphase habe ich sie an ein USB-SATA-Adapter gehangen, um einen ersten Test zu machen. Einschalten - nix passiert?Beim Hochheben der Platte habe ich dann wohl gemerkt, dass sie läuft! Sie ist sehr leise, auch beim Anlaufen. Die 2TB-Seagate-Platte in meiner\xa0\nApple Time Capsule 2TB (drahtloser Netzwerkspeicher und AirPort Extreme Basisstation)\n\xa0genau wie die\xa0\nSeagate Expansion Desktop STBV2000200 Externe Festplatte 2TB (8,9 cm (3,5 Zoll), USB 3.0)\n\xa0""schreien"" beim Anlaufen kurz auf (klingt ein bißchen wie Darth Vaders Tie-Fighter). Hier bei der WD-RED: Nix zu hören. Kaum Vibrationen zu spüren. Bei Zugriffen auch keine unangenehmen Geräusche. Also bisher: Daumen hoch!SMART hat über das USB-Adapter-Gedöns nicht funktioniert, also habe ich die Platte mutig ins laufende NAS geworfen. Hot-Plug sollte das Synology ja können. Platte 2 einfach rausziehen, die Platten im Rahmen ummontieren und die neue 6TB reinschieben. Fertig! Keine 5 Minuten für die Hardwaregeschichte.Im Speichermanager des DSM dann die Prüfung und Vorbereitung der Platte und anschließend Reparatur des RAID-Volumens anstoßen. Keine Probleme, alles fluppt. Naja - fluppen ist nicht das richtige Wort - die Reparatur des RAID-Volumens hat acht Stunden gedauert (1,74TB Daten von Platte 1 auf die neue Platte spiegeln). Ein kurzer SMART-Check: alles normal.Den langen SMART-Check wollte ich über Nacht laufen lassen, das habe ich aber unterschätzt: Der lief 16 Stunden!!!Die Platte ist halt recht groß - man muss Geduld mitbringen. Ergebnis: Problemlos. Keine Aussetzer, keine Warnungen.Geil!Die Platte wird ein wenig wärmer als die alte 2TB-Platte, die hat nämlich aktuell 23°C, die neue 6TB meldet 27°C. Immer noch: Cooles Ding. Die Zeiten, wo man sich die Finger an Platten verbrennen konnte, sind definitiv vorbei. Der Lüfter im Synology ist im ""Lieber leiser als kälter""-Modus - aber diese Temperaturen sind mehr als in Ordnung.Von der Geschwindigkeit kann ich nichts berichten - intern soll sie laut Datenblatt 175MB/s schaffen, in dem Fall begrenzt das Gigabit-Ethernet des NAS-Systems eher als die Platte, das Synology liefert ""nur"" knappe 100MB/s. Reicht hierfür also!In einer oder zwei Wochen, wenn nichts Außergewöhnliches auftritt, bekommt die neue Platte dann auch eine passende Schwester, damit ich den Platz, der neu zur Verfügung steht, auch nutzen kann.Ich werde die Rezension erweitern, wenn es Neuigkeiten gibt.Bis dahin das Fazit: keine Probleme aufgetreten, Installation problemlos, Platte leise und kalt und vor allem: riesig viel Platz!Edit:Update nach 300 Stunden: Null Fehler. Die zweite Platte ist inzwischen da. Die war übrigens anders verpackt! Sie war nicht in der durchsichtigen Plastikhülle drin, sondern ""nur"" in der Antistatiktüte, dafür mit zwei Kunststoff-Formteilen fest im Karton verpackt - da wackelte nichts mehr. Sehr gutes und vertrauenerweckendes System!Ob das aber immer so ist - keine Ahnung.Edit2:Update nach 800 Stunden: Null Fehler. Die zweite Platte ist komischerweise 2°C kälter als die zuerst eingebaute. Was aber merkwürdig ist: Der Load Cycle Counter ist nach 400 Stunden Betrieb auf 332, bei der nunmehr fast 800 Stunden laufenden ersten Platte noch bei 58. Scheinbar sind die beiden Platten trotz identischer Firmware unterschiedlich konfiguriert, am NAS sollte das meiner Meinung nach nicht liegen, dass eine Platte öfter schlafen geht als die andere...Wenn das linear so weitergeht, hält die ""neuere"" Platte nur hochgerechnet 91 Jahre, bis der Load Cycle Counter auf 600.000 steht - und dann ist laut WD ein Ausfall wahrscheinlich :-/Also ganz so beunruhigt bin ich nicht, aber dass die beiden sich unterschiedlich verhalten, ist schon ein bißchen komisch.Edit3:Neuestes Update: Der Load-Cycle-Counter der neueren Platte hat sich nicht linear weiter erhöht. Und das ohne weiteres Zutun. Komisch, aber ok.Die 2° Temperaturunterschied zwischen den Platten sind geblieben - Messungenauigkeit oder tatsächliche Differenz? Ich kann\'s nicht sagen. Ist mir inzwischen auch total peng.Hier mal im Vergleich die aktuellen SMART-Daten (Platte 1 wurde später ersetzt!):Platte 1: Power-On Hours:  744h / Load Cycle: 359 / Start-Stop-Cycle: 69 / Temperatur: 24°CPlatte 2: Power-On Hours: 1078h / Load Cycle:  85 / Start-Stop-Cycle: 81 / Temperatur: 26°CKeine weiteren Auffälligkeiten oder Fehler. Feine Platten.Die erste der beiden ""alten"" Platten wurde nun einer neuen Bestimmung zugeführt, die zweite verbleibt noch mit den ""alten"" Daten vom NAS als Backup.Die Zeitintervalle des Nachschnüffelns werden nun wohl größer werden. Aber ich behalte das hier mal bei...Edit4:Alles gut. 3 Monate im Betrieb. Fehler: 0,0. Die zweite Backup-Platte ist im externen USB 3.0 Gehäuse eingebaut und wandert jetzt Richtung Backup-Medium für\'s NAS. Mache mir nun keine großen Sorgen mehr.Hier mal im Vergleich die aktuellen SMART-Daten (Platte 1 wurde später ersetzt!):Platte 1: Power-On Hours: 1364h / Load Cycle: 455 / Start-Stop-Cycle: 164 / Temperatur: 24°CPlatte 2: Power-On Hours: 1697h / Load Cycle: 181 / Start-Stop-Cycle: 176 / Temperatur: 27°CEdit5:Halbes Jahr ist um. Läuft. Ich vermute, dass hier eher die Leute schreiben, die Ärger mit der Platte haben als die, deren Geräte klaglos und unauffällig laufen. Ich kann nichts Negatives berichten. Keine Fehler in den SMART-Tests. Täglich wird ein Schnelltest gemacht und monatlich ein erweiterter SMART-Test (ich bekomme dann auch einmal im Monat einen ""Gesundheitsbericht"" vom NAS per mail - wie nett). Die Temperaturen steigen an - es wird ja auch wärmer in Deutschland. Bin mal auf den Sommer gespannt, aber 30° ist ja noch super. Das NAS steht im Keller, dort sind keine 32° Umgebungstemperatur zu erwarten.2980 Stunden sind übrigens 124 Tage - die erste Platte ist jedoch schon knappe 160 Tage eingebaut. Die restliche Zeit hat sie also ""frei"" - wenn die Power-On-Hours von der Platte so korrekt gerechnet werden :-). Rechnerisch 78% an und 22% aus. Über\'n Daumen. Dennoch finde ich, dass das relativ wenig Stillstand ist. Aber irgendwer ist hier zu Hause ja ständig online und schaltet einen Rechner oder ein Handy oder was auch immer an und irgendeine App schaut auf dem NAS mal nach dem Rechten oder ein PC macht ein Backup oder ...Hier mal wie immer im Vergleich die aktuellen SMART-Daten (Platte 1 wurde später ersetzt!):Platte 1: Power-On Hours: 2646h / Load Cycle: 556 / Start-Stop-Cycle: 266 / Temperatur: 27°CPlatte 2: Power-On Hours: 2980h / Load Cycle: 282 / Start-Stop-Cycle: 278 / Temperatur: 30°CEdit6: (22.02.2016)Über ein Jahr ist vergangen, Platte 1 ist 395 Tage in Betrieb (zumindest Power-on-hours...).Es ändert sich aber nix - die Dinger laufen ohne Probleme.An den Bewertungen bei Amazon sieht man inzwischen auch, dass die Mehrzahl der Käufer glücklich mit der Platte sind.An den unten stehenden Daten sehe ich, dass sich die Laufzeit zwar verdreifacht hat, die Load- und Start-Stop-Cycles aber nicht. Warum nicht? Laufen die Platten inzwischen im Dauerlauf durch? Ist das ein neues Feature im DSM? Oder greift hier 24 Stunden am Tag einer aufs NAS zu? Hm - dann macht sich das sicher auch im Stromverbrauch bemerkbar. :-/Hier mal wie immer im Vergleich die aktuellen SMART-Daten (Platte 1 wurde später ersetzt!):Platte 1: Power-On Hours: 9151h / Load Cycle: 602 / Start-Stop-Cycle: 296 / Temperatur: 28°CPlatte 2: Power-On Hours: 9485h / Load Cycle: 328 / Start-Stop-Cycle: 308 / Temperatur: 30°CEdit7: (10.01.2017)Soll ich wieder schreiben, dass keine Fehler aufgetreten sind? Lass ich mal... Ist wieder ein Jahr vergangen. Läuft einfach.Wenn ich mir die Load-Cycles ansehe, scheint mir allerdings, dass die Platten fast ununterbrochen laufen. Dass sie nachts früher ausgegangen waren, hat sich wohl erledigt, da immer mehr Geräte auf das NAS zugreifen - auch nachts.Und die 6TB sind jetzt fast voll - was soll ich nun kaufen? 10TB von Seagate?Ich denke, ich werde eher ein 4-Bay NAS kaufen und noch eine oder zwei dieser 6TB-Platten.Hier mal wie immer im Vergleich die aktuellen SMART-Daten (Platte 1 wurde später ersetzt!):Platte 1: Power-On Hours: 16866h / Load Cycle: 709 / Start-Stop-Count: 382 / Temperatur: 25°CPlatte 2: Power-On Hours: 17200h / Load Cycle: 435 / Start-Stop-Count: 392 / Temperatur: 27°CEdit8: (26.06.2017)Gähn. Keine besonderen Vorkommnisse.Das NAS ärgert mich die letzte Zeit mit ständigem Offline-sein, aber die Platten laufen. Scheint die NAS-Software zu sein. Seit einem Update gestern läuft\'s wieder.Übrigens: Die Firmware beider Platten ist die 82.00A82Hier mal wie immer im Vergleich die aktuellen SMART-Daten (Platte 1 wurde später ersetzt!):Platte 1: Power-On Hours: 20850h / Load Cycle: 763 / Start-Stop-Count: 394 / Temperatur: 30°CPlatte 2: Power-On Hours: 21184 / Load Cycle: 489 / Start-Stop-Count: 404 / Temperatur: 32°CEdit 9: (01.11.2017)Mein Synology 213+ hat aufgegeben - die Platten nicht.Sind zusammen mit einer 10TB Seagate Iron Wolf in einem neuen Synology DS416 play eingezogen.Der Load-Cycle sowie der Start-Stop-Counter schnellen in die Höhe - das neue NAS scheint wieder regelmäßig schlafen zu gehen. Komisch. Aber für den Stromverbrauch schon ok. Alle anderen kritischen Werte der Platten sind auf Null - null Fehler.Einmal noch für\'s Protokoll:Platte 1: Power-On Hours: 22918h / Load Cycle: 2980 / Start-Stop-Count: 2619 / Temperatur: 29°CPlatte 2: Power-On Hours: 23254 / Load Cycle: 2706 / Start-Stop-Count: 2625 / Temperatur: 28°CDas war\'s. Mehr werde ich nicht schreiben. Ich kann die Platten wie gesagt absolut empfehlen. Auf Dauer werde ich auf größere umsteigen und da wahrscheinlich die Seagate Iron-Wolf Serie nehmen. Eine habe ich bereits, die läuft. Ist aktuell auch 40€ günstiger als die vergleichbare WD Red, beim Kauf der Platte war aber (noch) keine verfügbar. Ansonsten kein besonderer Grund, auf Seagate umzusteigen.Diese läuft jetzt übrigens seit 1769 Stunden ebenfalls problemlos und kühl (28°C) und ohne Fehler. Hoffentlich bleibt das dabei.Doch noch ein Edit (12/2020):Die beiden WD haben jetzt über 49.000 Power-On Stunden auf der Uhr ohne Fehler.Die Seagate IronWolf sammelt dahingegen defekte Sektoren - wir sind jetzt aktuell bei 16.  Finde ich gerade ziemlich doof. Der Health-Status findet das übrigens ""normal"". Früher war das der entscheidende Trigger für meinen Sofort-neue-Platte-kaufen-Zeigefinger.', ""Per quel che riguarda l'Hard Disk, niente da dire, invece per l'imballaggio diciamo che lasciava un poco desiderare, essendo un Hard disk un'apparecchiatura piuttosto delicata e sensibile agli urti, era solo con la bustina antistatica in una scatola molto più grande e con un pezzo di carta accartocciata che neanche lo avvolgeva, praticamente si muoveva libero nella scatola.Mi è andata bene !!!!"", ""Utilisé dans un NAS Synology allumé en permanence avec un usage modéré, ce disque acheté en 2016 aura tenu 7 ans sans problèmes.Il génère désormais des erreurs d'I/O et doit être remplacé.

You have to either install this an internal drive, or buy an external drive case for this, with cables, etc.  This is a do it yourself product and not for novice users.This drive is NOT a consumer product.  You have to go to the website to get the instructions on how to format this drive, etc.  That is what they mean by Bulk/OEM labels - it lacks any extras included with consumer hard drives in a box.  You have to order the cables you need, and download the configuration software from the WD website, which is fairly easy to do.If you don\'t want to configure a drive like this, find a consumer external drive with the CD, cable, etc. and buy it instead.You need to know if your PC will handle large partitions, ie. 2 TB, or you have to format it with several partitions due to older operating systems.I did not buy a separate external drive box, but bought an Anker external open case with power supply and capability to connect to both USB 3.0 AND eSata connections.  I did that because using the eSata port on my old laptop was much faster than 2.0 USB.  But, I can move the box and drive to my desktop which has a USB 3.0 add in card.  Both eSata and USB 3.0 are much faster transfer speeds than USB 2.0 and this drive can handle it.I have included pictures of the drive working fine in the Anker case so you can see both in use.Note:  Hard drives have standard connections to the case or internal slot for power and data transfer.  The ability to provide USB 3.0 or eSata connections is built into the case, not the hard drive.  Both USB 2.0 and eSata require special cables, so don\'t forget to get them if you do this.  In my case, since I used the external ""open"" Anker docking station, I didn\'t need cables.  I just slid the drive into the docking slot and the connection for data and power was made.  The Anker unit also has an on off switch.Of course, if you use this drive internally in your system, that is a different process and involves other tasks if you make it your primary drive with an operating system.  I did not do that, so mine is used primarily for a video data file drive and has not been setup with booting capability.You can\'t go wrong with Western Digital.  (Unless they sell out to someone,then watch what changes in quality).  You can get this drive in 1 TB, 2 TB or 3 TB versions.  I got the 2 TB version and it cost about 30% more than WD drives with lower speeds and features.']"

It\'s just a safety measure to make sure any bad clusters are marked out (though I\'ve never gotten a bad cluster on an HGST).  Then when you format it use make sure to use something more advanced than windows built in format.  You want the drive to be GPT and you want to format it as NTFS with maximum cluster size (64kB) this will reduce seek latency because max cluster size reduces MFT reference/seek time.  And again, you want to do this is as a deep format, not a quick format; the LLF and deep format on the 16TB took me about 16.5 Hours for each operation; the drive does maintain a steady state sequential read and write speed of 256MB/s. (and in case you\'re like ""where\'s my full 16TB?""  when they say it\'s 16TeraBYTES they literally mean 16 trillion bytes, which works out to 14.55 proper TB [this is completely normal: 16,000,000,000,000 Bytes /1024 /1024 /1024 /1024 = 14.55TB]', ""Other than the noise it makes on spin-up which makes one think it's broken, the drive is whisper quiet for an enterprise-class drive.

I chose it because it still uses CMR technology. Most 3TB hard drives (Toshiba included) use SMR technology (Shingled Magnetic Recording) which is inferior to CMR. A SMR drive will - for every erase action - also delete other data allocated next to it; because of the size of the erase head in relation to the magnetic area that holds the data. In a second step, the drive then needs to re-write that data, which is temporarily stored in a RAM buffer. So this is prone to disaster, especially when used in NAS drives or RAID configurations. While a bigger RAM suggests you have a superior product, in this case the opposite actually is true.

Farò quindi una recensione unica per entrambi.DISCO 3.5"" 6TB ST6000DM003Il primo disco (Seagate BarraCuda 6 TB 3.5"") funziona molto bene, tutti i parametri SMART sono perfetti e corrispondenti a quelli di un disco nuovo di fabbrica, si riscalda il giusto, vibra pochissimo: Seagate è sempre una garanzia di serietà e, a mio avviso, è il migliore (quanto meno il più ""versatile"") tra gli unici tre produttori modiali di hard disk superstiti (Seagate, Western Digital e Toshiba, tutti gli altri si limitano a mettere il loro marchio  su un disco acquistato da questi tre); almeno nella fascia di prodotti che ho avuto occasione di provare, la serie Barracuda è migliore degli equivalenti WD ""Blue"" che, invece, hanno un livello di vibrazione nettamente superiore (negli sfortunati esemplari che mi è capitata la disgrazia di avere).DISCO 2.5"" 5TB ST5000LM000L\'altro disco (Seagate BarraCuda 5 TB 2.5"") lascia invece molto a desiderare. Quanto a vibrazioni, come il suo ""cugino"" più grosso vibra pochissimo, pressoché impercettibile. Però, sarà forse perché faceva parte di un sistema più complesso, probabilmente un NAS od un RAID (e in questo caso, come per le unità esterne vendute già in box USB, i dischi utilizzati sembrano in qualche modo di qualità ed affidabilità inferiore rispetto a quelli venduti ""sciolti""), le sue prestazioni sono assolutamente inaccettabili: soprattutto in scrittura, spesso si ""blocca"" (o, meglio, si bloccano le attività di scrittura) per un intervallo più o meno lungo, per poi infine riprendere (in genere...). A volte, però, la scrittura si è interrotta ed il disco è ""scomparso"" dal sistema: per rivederlo (e fare l\'indispensabile, in questi casi, ""check disk"") è stato necessario scollegarlo e ricollegarlo.Tutto questo a causa di un numero elevatissimo di errori di lettura, di seek ma soprattutto di timeout, come mostrato dai suoi parametri SMART (1, ""Raw_Read_Error_Rate"", 108040296; 7, ""Seek_Error_Rate"", 26196218; 188, ""Command_Timeout"", 141738050386; questi parametri dovrebbero invece avere valori molto bassi, idealmente ZERO, come avviene d\'altra parte per dischi meno ""tirati"" o fosre semplicemente di migliore qualità). Dati i problemi che mi dava, ho deciso di utilizzare il programma diagnostico Seagate (SeaTools) per un test completo, ottenendo un ""FAILED"".Ho deciso quindi di restituirlo al venditore (in quanto NON COPERTO DA GARANZIA Seagate perché facente parte in origine di un altro sistema) e sono in attesa di informazioni sulle modalità di reso. Spero di poter dare notizie (positive!) al più presto.AGGIORNAMENTO 2/3/21:Disco restituito senza problemi e prontamente ed integralmente rimborsato. Anche se il venditore è inizialmente un po\' approssimativo nel fornire informazioni sul disco, c\'è da dire che le comunicazioni sono pronte ed efficaci e la politica di reso senza alcun intoppo.VENDITOREQuanto al venditore (Fabio Store), a parte la velocità del disco dichiarata nell\'annuncio (7200 g/m anziché i reali 5400, come d\'altra parte facilmante rilevabile dai datasheet pubblicati da Seagate, completi e dettagliati anche se non facilissimi da trovare), vende spesso componenti OEM, cioè nati come parte di altri prodotti e non vendibili singolarmente, quindi non coperti da GARANZIA SEAGATE.Tutto ciò senza nessuna indicazione nell\'annuncio Amazon, anche se i prezzi sono di circa il 20% più bassi di altri ed il venditore risponde comunque velocemente alla richiesta di informazioni sulla garanzia, che dichiara di fornire autonomamente, fiducioso della qualità dei prodotti che vende: in questo caso, purtroppo, i dischi da 2.5"" di taglio superiore ad 1 TB danno, secondo la mia esperienza (modesta, ma composta comunque di 5~6 dischi da 2TB, uno da 3, uno da 4 - WD - ed uno da 5), non pochi problemi, tanto agli acquirenti quanto, potenzialmente, ai venditori.In ogni caso, la comunicazione col venditore è sempre stata rapida (a volte anche troppo!) ed efficace e le procedure di reso e rimborso sono rapide e funzionano impeccabilmente; per mancanza di esperienza non saprei dire relativamente alle procedure di sostituzione, ma non dubito che funzionino altrettanto bene.IN CONCLUSIONE1) Attenzione ai dischi da 2.5"" ""commerciali"" (cioè, non professionali, d\'altra parte - e non a caso - inesistenti) di taglio superiore ad 1TB: per una serie di motivi, tecnici e commericali, danno ben più problemi di quelli di taglio inferiore e - sempre econdo la mia modesta esperienza - conviene acquistarli solo per carichi di lavoro relativamente modesti e comunque muniti di una solida garanzia, altrimenti il rischio di perdere i propri soldi (e i propri DATI!) aumenta approssimativamente di 3~4 volte.2) A meno che non amiate il RISCHIO (o non conosciate personalmente il venditore, fidandovi ciecamente di lui), NON acquistate MAI dischi USATI!3) Prima di acquistare un disco, soprattutto da 2.5"", è ottima norma indagare sul sito del venditore scaricando e consultando tutti i manuali disponibili (tenete presente che WD rispetto a Seagate fornisce molti meno dati, sia nei data sheet che nei parametri SMART e può per queosto a volte sembrare migliore anche quando non lo è); soprattutto per evitare certi venditori spesso ""superficiali"" nelle loro descrizioni quando non proprio (ma non è questo il caso) dei TRUFFATORI.4)Non dimenticate I BACKUP!', 'Velogità di recapito.

Inutile dire che i 10 secondi cumulativi totali risparmiati rispetto ad un Western Digital si tramutarono presto in mesi di dischi offline, ricostruzioni del RAID, frustrazioni... tuttavia sempre brillantemente coperte dell'assistenza Seagate.Allora era stato il consumo, il rumore e la velocità a farmi propendere per Seagate. Questa volta è stata Western Digital stessa... ho notato in giro alcuni report di come i rinomati WD RED NAS drives non abbiano affatto un'affidabilità soddisfacente, specialmente nel taglio minimo (monopiatto, due piatti).Considerando che OVUNQUE online quando vedi qualcuno che fa un video di NAS ci ficca dentro dei WD RED la conclusione ovvia è che, indipendentemente delle capacità della casa madre, la produzione sicuramente si sarà affrettata, probabilmente fabbricando piatti da ruote di carriole dismesse e pettini con testine da vecchi tuner AM e deck a cassetta.Ecco, in base alla precedente poco ortodossa e molto empirica considerazione ho pensato che sarebbe stato molto meglio prendere questo Seagate.

Tempo fa ho perso un HDD seagate barracuda da 2 TB con lo stesso problema, usata come unità backup esterna, dopo un tempo di utilizzo totale di 4 giorni (parametro SMART) - erano passati 2 anni per cui soldi buttati e il 10% dei dati persi perché irrecuperabili.Anche in questo questo caso l'hdd ST4000VX007 ha mostrato errori SMART crescenti per i parametri:- seek error rate- Raw_Read_Error_RateIl tool di seagate (Seatool) viene sempre eseguito correttamente non indicando problemi sull'unità.Per tali ragioni e memore per quanto accaduto in passato si cerca prima qualche risposta sul web senza grandi risultati e successivamente si contatta direttamente la seagate.Qui accade qualcosa di strano:inzialmente il problema viene minimizzato (sollecitando l'uso del seatool, a mio avviso non dirimente) ma con le domande specifiche e inoltrando più report dei parametri SMART (uso HDDsentinel, che è in monitoraggio continuo!) la seagate ammette che c'è un problema sull'unità per cui si avvia il reso.Non è normale che un HDD presenti questo tipo di errori e se anche funziona correttamente non è detto che lo faccia per molto.Soprattutto se lo usate anche per farci dei backup dovete starci molto attenti!Il mio consiglio è sempre monitorizzare i parametri SMART dato che sono predittivi di problemi sull'unità e di una qualche futura rottura.Detto questo passiamo all'analisi del prodotto.L'unità presenta una velocità di 5900 rpm con una velocità di lettura/scrittura che arriva anche a punte di poco superiori a 180 MB/s, quindi decisamente più reattivo di un WD purple (5400 rpm e velocità di r/w 160 MB/s).E' silenziosa più di un HDD HGST desktop nas da 4 TB (7200 rpm) che attualmente si trovano a prezzi stratosferici..."", 'Sono partito con un seagate barracuda per poi passare a questo skyhawk, la differenza qualitativa nella velocità di scrittura è incredibile, assolutamente consigliato!', ""I'd say from my 3 days of experience this is working great.

Under testing the write speeds have handled the load from all twelve but this is never encountered in day to day. What it does deal with day to day however, is a constant barrage of writes from three to four cameras at once. With our setup in this environment it is not too uncommon for all eight to be demanding constant writes from multiple triggers. The point being in the four months there have been a lot of rewrites and it's still holding like new.  Highly Recommended"", ""Ce disque dur a fonctionné 4 mois dans un NVR FOSCAM .

It’s a blend of light colors such as gray, beige, & white. With a little bit of vibrancy brought in by the blue. It’s a lovely print that could be matched with almost any décor. Looks fabulous with my farmhouse style furnishings. I wanted a rug in a light shade that was still capable of hiding dirt well. With 3 kids & a yorkie, it’s impossible to keep a rug clean. Especially in my living room. This was a great solution. The fibers are low pile & incredibly soft. Feels nice against bare feet. Vacuums clean easily with a small vacuum. It’s machine washable on cold, delicate cycle & hang to dry. This rug has a textured, slip-resistant backing that works well on hard floors, although it does still slide some if not held down by heavy furniture. I’d recommend using rugs pads if you’re using this rug on hardwood or tile. Just to ensure it stays in place. It arrives folded & there are quite a few creases, not just through the middle, but along the edges. Over the span of a few weeks the creases will flatten but does take a while. However, the edges still haven’t smoothed out. This makes the seams along the edge look slightly wonky & uneven, and the only reason I couldn’t give it 5 stars. This rug is great for high traffic areas such as a living room. It’s a beautiful decorative piece. Just wish it had come rolled instead of folded.', 'I\'ve never tried using a washable rug before, but I\'m pleasantly surprised by this one. It\'s INCREDIBLY soft! I\'m using it in my rabbits play area and we all love it. It\'s super thin, and has a rubber backing like a non-slip bath mat. The top material is more like a silky fleece type of fabric than a typical rug. I haven\'t actually washed it yet, but I did put it in my standard size front loading washing machine to make sure it fit and there was plenty of room to spare (photo attached). It takes up less space than a twin comforter.It is possible to vacuum it, but I need to have my vacuum on the lowest suction setting, and even then it occasionally gets sucked up into the vacuum enough to turn off the roller and I have to reset it. If you have furniture on both ends this would be less of an issue - but even without furniture I\'m finding it not too big of a hassle to vacuum.The other ""issue"" really is that the creases are difficult to get out, I wonder if it would become more or less creased after washing.... really can\'t say for certain yet. But, since this is really just for my rabbits and I to roll around on, and to make cleaning their area easier for me, I\'m very pleased with it regardless. The softness, how easy it is to gather it up and shake it off outside, and I can do spot cleaning with just water as needed until I\'m ready to wash the whole thing. I don\'t think I\'d want something this thin as like a main feature in my home, but for high mess areas with pets and kids I think it\'s excellent. Would recommend for those uses! Hope this helps!', ""We have a brand new front door that wasn't able to open with our old rug in front. (it's so brand new it hasn't been trimmed-out, don't mind the construction mess). This is probably the lowest-pile rug I have seen and it works under our door!! It is soft like a plush blanket and I wasn't quite ready for that but it has really grown on me. The colors are vibrant and I love the pattern. The edges are finished but do not lay down very well. I'm hoping over time that it lays down and straightens out because it looks a bit funny as it is and cheapens the look. If it does lay down and looses the creases from the vacuum packing I think it will be awesome. Comes folded in vacuum pack in a small bag so for shipping/moving purposes this is simple. It's lightweight too which is nicely moved by 1 person."", 'Not as pretty as the picture but the color is great…. Not thick but is soft', ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0I like the design and colors of this rug. It has gray, blue, black, and beige. I've been using it for two weeks now, and barely had to vacuum it yesterday. I like that it doesn't get dirty fast. It is soft and stays in place.The only thing I don't like is that I do notice the crease lines. I haven't been able to get them out, even after following the directions."", ""Impressed with the quality of this carpeting.  Price point wise it's in line with what you find at Wal-Mart.  However, it's way way better!It's washable even in my top loading with an agitator washing machine.  It doesn't get super heavy when wet, and it dries quickly.My absolute favorite feature though is the feel of this carpet.  You know how you buy a winter shirt that is just so utterly touchable you feel like you're wearing a hug?  This carpet has that feel to it.  I've never had a carpet or rug with such softness before.  I'm a tad worried it will start to shed fuzzies everywhere, but so far so good.I'm in love with this carpet.  Even though I like the pattern of another rug I have in my bedroom more, the softness wins so I'm swapping them out.  I want this where I'm walking on it every single day.  It's like walking on a cuddly cloud."", ""It's a short pile that has a soft backed bottom that won't scratch hardwood and stays where you put it. The colors are vibrant and it goes very nice from rustic to a modern home. It's soft enough to fit in a normal sized washing machine and has a soft texture that feels good on the feet. Above all the design is pleasing to the eye but in distracting in the room."", 'This is a nice, well made rug. It’s light weight, but perfect for my use. It’s a nice pattern, and looks as if it will hold up…even with 4 cats and a dog. :) Would work well in any room…I am using in the kitchen. It is so soft! My cats and dog have already made it their bed, lol. Love it! ❤️', 'This rug is great in person! Looks nice and vacuums nice! I highly recommend!']"

It's LITERALLY plug and play. I use it in combination with a 5-bay external HDDRACK and (1) standard PC power supply - using both will get you (8) drives on your desktop. And it doesn't have to go inside a PC case - works just fine standalone sitting on top of the tower case.The 5-bay HDDRACK uses standard SATA power cable for each drive, and this enclosure uses 2x Molex 4-pin power. Connect everything to a bog-standard -8E LSI 2008 (or better) SAS HBA in IT mode and add a UPS for battery backup and power protection, and Bob's your uncle. This is **PERFECT for ZFS** if you only need up to 8 drives.If you need more than that, add on another PC power supply, another -8E SAS HBA in a 4x PCIe slot (or replace with a -16E 4-port HBA) + one of these enclosures, and another 5-bay HDDRACK and you've got (16) drives running without spending a whole lot of money for a disk shelf.I verified it works fine with both SATA and SAS drives by buying a cheap 4TB used SAS drive and putting it in with a 4TB SATA Seagate Ironwolf NAS drive, they both mirrored fine with ZFS (ashift=12) even though the SAS drive is 512-sector and the SATA is  4k-sector. Didn't even need to use the 5x included SATA cables.I have tested it with up to 10TB Toshiba NAS drives. Not sure what the maximum drive size is for this enclosure but it does work fine with all drives tested so far, I don't know of any reason why it wouldn't take 16TB or 18TB drives. Very happy with it, would buy again and have recommended it to my mates on /r/DataHoarder.PROTIP: I leave the 5th bay open for drive swaps. They do die, and then all you need to do is switch the cable to the 5th port."", 'The fit of the drive caddies is a little off and the plastic can interfere with itself, creating a very delicate mechanism to put the drives back in to the chassis.I also found the screw patterns didn’t quite work out as nicely for my Rosewill case, so the bays sit a little deeper in the case than looks nice.I do prefer this over opening up my server and changing out drives, but I would not buy more if these to fill out my case.', ""I was initially very excited to get this device in the mail. But my excitement turned into disappointment as soon as I discovered that there were NO INSTRUCTIONS included with (or for) this device. Nothing telling you what the MAXIMUM SIZE of the Hard Drives that you could use or HOW to Connect it (both the cables AND the Power Connections) nor whether or not you need a RAID Card or an SAS Card.I was so disappointed that I even went back to the Web Site (where this item is sold) looking for a link that might provide me with an Instruction Manual. No luck there either...Overall from what I can see there are 2 major drawbacks to this enclosure...One, that there is no Instruction Manual or even a Spec Sheet included.Two, that this enclosure is meant to be used internally. The main problem with this is that now-a-day there are very few PC Cases that even have the space for more than 2 HD Spaces and finding one with 5 bays that are open will impossible or at the very least, will be very difficult to find....I recently put together a NEW PC with a Ryzen 16 Core CPU and was looking for a case that had 2 5 1/4' Hard Drive Bays that were open (1 for a CD/DVD Drive and 1 for a 6 Port USB connection and Memory Card Port Reader). It took me quite a while to find one, but I did. So finding a case with enough space for 5 Drive Bays open is going to be VERY DIFFICULT!!!Also, supposedly there is (or was) a RAID Card that is (or was) meant to be used with this device, but there is NO MENTION of this card or even WHO makes it or the Model Number. Now this is hearsay so I cannot guarantee whether this statement is true or not. But it would be nice to know for sure if this is true or not...As it stands (right now) I cannot recommend this device to anyone because of the lack of Instructions for this device...Sorry guys... I was looking forward to this device, so much for that idea...Better luck next time...Joe..."", 'I got this for my main computer.  I do my video processing on it and have a sizable library of both mechanical and solid state drives that hold decades of travel videos and photos.  Being able to easily plug and unplug the drives without needing to lay on the floor to install in the computer box is a blessing for this 70 year old guy who doesn’t bend like he used to.This is recognized by both Windows and Linux systems with no problem.  The drive drawers slide in and out easily.  The drives mount easily and link quickly.  As another reviewer has stated, it is NOT a “hot swap”, meaning the drives can be changed on the fly and the system will automatically recognize.  It IS a “hot plug”, meaning you can change the drive, but you system may not recognize without a reboot.  For me, that does not matter, as I would not hot change anyway, especially any mechanical drive.  This is NOT a raid case, but it can be used outside of the computer case, as I am doing.  I do wish I could buy more trays, as I would just permanently mount all of my drives.  I’d need 10 more.4 stars but be aware of the limitations.Note: I have been an Amazon customer for almost 20 years. I write all of my reviews to reflect my personal observations and opinions on a product. It matters not if I have purchased the item myself or if it was provided to me for review. My goal is to provide other potential customers as much real-world knowledge as possible to make an informed decision. In most cases I will return to my review in 6 months or less to see if I should alter my original observations. In no case will the cost of a product influence my opinions at all. In addition, I will try to include multiple images and or videos on each product, if practical.', 'This external enclosure holds 5 SATA HDDs. 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch.The included mounting screws are for securing the HDD in the sleds. The included SATA cables are for running from the backplate of the enclosure to the external SATA connections on your PC tower. The backplate has two Molex 4-pin connections for powering the cooling fan and HDDs.Expansion Raid card suggested for using this unit. Extensions from PC for power, or standalone PCI power supply, needed.This is NOT a stand alone NAS. This model does not have USB-C or its own power supply.The enclosure is sturdy and hot swap bays function smoothly.', 'I went into this knowing exactly what it would be; hence it meets my expectations.This is purely a metal case + 5 easy connect disk-bays plugging into a disk SAS/SATA + power connection backplane. Nothing more, nothing less.It does not have its own power supply: You provide a standard external 4-pin power connection, which through the backplane powers your drives.It does not have network, USB, or eSATA connectivity. No such controller built in. It includes 5 SATA cables and connections on the back, meant for you to connect each drive directly to a SAS or SATA controller in your desktop computer. You feed the data connections to the backplane, which then feeds it to your drives.In my case, it does exactly what I needed it to do.My ""desktop case"" (really floor case) is the massive Thermaltake W200 sitting atop a Thermaltake P200 pedestal. Open the P200 side door, stick in this entire disk case lying on its side, and power it from cabling I already have running down there.As for data connections, I had no need for the included SATA cables. My system includes an Adaptec SAS RAID card with cabling for 256 drives, which currently only feed 33 disk drives (mixed spinners and SSDs). This box allows me to add another 5 drives down there, plugged directly to the existing SAS cabling. Easy-peasy.The RackChoice box is not even visible after I close the P200 door. It is there merely to hold the drives in place. :-)This unit has a built-in fan to help keeping the drives cool, if you connect it externally. In my (computer-) case the P200 pedestal is set up with 4 x 140 mm fans blowing air across the pedestal keeping the air down there constantly exchanged blowing out the heat from the existing dozen+ drives in the P200, so this unit\'s little fan did not mean anything to me.So.. Go into this product knowing that it is exactly what it promises, which is very little.To connect this, you need 5 open SATA/SAS connections and a 12 V Molex power connection/extension long enough to reach this unit. You will NOT be using this with a laptop, only desktops need apply. And unless you have a chassis big enough to hide it inside, the back of your setup will likely look a little like a porcupine, with the 5 SATA and 1 PWR cable running between your computer and this box sticking out. :-)Great little unit that does what it is supposed to, and nothing more.BTW. Don\'t let the product photo of its backside that shows the blinded off USB, power button connections confuse you. A case of using the same design plastic back-cover for more advanced units. These connections DO NOT EXIST for this unit. You cannot connect this unit using USB, eSATA, even if you knock out the plastic blinds. :-)To the people complaining about lack of documentation (such as not knowing which size drives it supports). Such size (disk capacity) specs are meaningless to this unit, since it has no controller and merely supply a backplane with power and data connections. It simply keeps the drives ""alive"".Your computer and its controller set any disk capacity restrictions, if any at all.', ""This is an internal drive bay meaning you need to have a large case with room to put this in. I have a giant Thermaltake Tower 900 I am using this in. it is sitting in the back chamber of the case with my water cooling setup. this is great to help cable management to your disk or standard SSD drives.As far as hot swap, standard disk drives could run into issues as this is not really raid system with hotswap. it is simply a container to house your drives. SSD's are a bit more forgiving in this respect as there is no mechanical components.For my purpose it works perfect  as all my SSD drives had been sitting loose in the back of the case, now it doesn't look like a Frankenstein in the back of my case.One thing to note,  the case is likely used in multiple products it has closed holes for usb c, DC in, Power and reset.  none of those features are in this product so leave the covers in place."", 'This piece of gear is intended for computer enthusiasts and builders. No electronic experience need not apply.At first glance, you may think this is an empty desktop SAN or external enclosure for hot-swappable hard drives. But if you pay attention this is just an enclosure for up to five (5) hard drives and will make it hot-swap. It also needs an empty three (3) 5.25 drive bays. This means at a minimum mid-tower or tower computer case is needed.The description is also a misnomer. This device will allow you to do hot-plugging and not hot-swapping. To do hot-swapping you need to buy their RAID controller which should have been included here given the price of this device.I am disappointed when I opened the box to find out that there are no manuals included. I need to know the spec and some recommended wiring or installation setup. The online description says you can use 3.5-HDD or 5.25-HDD but the trays have only 4 holes at the bottom of the tray.  There is no guidance on where is the optimal hard drive placement to easily mount to the backplane. This would be a trial-and-error and part discovery when trying to incorporate this into the computer system plus a drill-bit may be necessary to mount the hard drives properly.The outside enclosure is smooth and has no rough edges. I thought the ribbed side is a heat sink but it is not since it is made of plastic. The only metals are the top and bottom. Heat dissipation would be an issue here. There is also a design issue or maybe a manufacturing issue on the front door. The right side of the door always hit the side panel and prevents you from pulling out the bay. You cannot just pull the bay but instead need to do some maneuvering to be able to pull it out. I know how many times you need to pull out a drive? But compared to others where it is a smooth operation this one is not.The tray is metal but the sides where you will slide it in are made of plastic. The plastic part is not securely fastened to the metal tray, it is wobbly and wiggles, and this can produce unnecessary vibrations when the computer is on. I need to find any manual or instructions for this device before I try to mount it.It is hard to recommend this even to enthusiasts because of the things I mentioned above.']"

It was padded with thick foam on the ends that held it still in transit. The enclosure and accessories were in plastic bags.The backplane came with three red SATA cables. The listing images and description do not indicate that these cables are included, so it was a nice surprise. It also came with plenty of screws for mounting the backplane itself and installing HDDs into the caddies.The enclosure feels well built. None of the outside panels flex with the caddies removed. It\'s definitely got some weight to it.This backplane was easy to install into a Rackchoice 3U case (ASIN B0BMTM73QT) that I\'ve also reviewed. As expected, mounting will vary between cases, but for the one I have I was able to screw it into a removable bracket included with my case. Everything lined up fine. The enclosure has a slot cut into the side that looks like it would work with keyed mounting solutions, like some sort of hot-swap system.The caddies are easy to operate. The buttons on them are easy to depress and the handles are spring-loaded. They slide in and out of the enclosure decently smooth.I tested this backplane outside of my Rackchoice case. I powered the backplane with a Flex PSU I had laying around. I installed an old Seagate drive I had laying around into Bay 1 and connected the first SATA port to an available SATA port on a Mini PC (ASIN B0BW56V95Y). I booted the PC into Windows 11. The drive was picked up in the `diskpart` utility. I then booted the PC into Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The drive was picked up in the `fdisk` utility. The read/write speeds in both operating systems were pretty standard.At the time of writing this review, I do not have a 3.5"" SAS drive available for testing the interposer. I will update this review when I test a SAS drive with this backplane.Onto a few complaints that I have with this backplane...One of the stickers on the front of the caddy was applied slightly crooked. This is a nitpick but doesn\'t seem like a hard thing to get right. To be fair the listing images show crooked labels as well, so I guess expect them not to be straight.One of the caddies that I received was not assembled properly. The caddy has metal fingers that protrude and slot into the plastic side panels (see images). The last finger on one side was not slotted into the side panel, making it difficult to insert the caddy into the enclosure. This seems like something that should\'ve been easily caught in quality control as the only way to insert the caddy is to hold down the side panel. I was able to fix it by removing the two screws at the front of the caddy, removing the front plate, and then reseating the side panel so it was attached to all three fingers on the caddy frame. If you buy this backplane I recommend inspecting the caddies as loose side panels can cause damage to the caddies or enclosure.And as for the price of this unit...At the time of writing this review, the price of this enclosure/backplane was $59.00. Compared to other offerings here on Amazon, such as StarTech\'s 4-Bay Backplane (ASIN B00OUSU8MI), I think this is a decent price. Per bay, this backplane is cheaper than much of the competition, but I think that the cheaper price is reflected in the fit and finish.', 'I got this bay adapter to potentially use in my home server, which has four 5.25"" bays. It\'s already using a similar Icy Dock-branded adapter which also accommodates three 3.5"" drives in two 5.25"" bays, so I\'ll be comparing the two.This adapter provides drive trays which should be screwed onto the drives before insertion to ensure correct alignment and allow easy removal. The trays are easy to install and seem well made, so I\'d say that\'s a small plus versus my other adapter which takes the bare drives on grooves. The trays have power (blue) and access (yellow) indicator lights for each drive which are easy to see and distinct from each other.The frame of the bracket itself is strong, precisely shaped steel with plenty of mounting holes for various case configurations and grooves on the sides for cases which have rails between the 5.25"" bays. It should fit in a wide variety of cases without any problems.SATA data cable connections and the two Molex connections for power both click in firmly but easily, and seem quite secure. It\'s a nice bonus that Molex cables lack the 3.3V rail which is often used as a reset signal in modern high-capacity or SAS hard drives, so there\'s no finagling needed to get those drives working. My other adapter passes through SATA connections straight from the PSU and won\'t work with some of the drives that I shucked from external enclosures, so this is a step up here too.My one significant complaint with this unit is regarding the fan. It\'s not that loud, though it has a bit of an annoying warble that would keep from putting it in a room where I\'d be spending a lot of time. It\'s certainly fine for a home server in a closet, and much quieter than any rackmount server I\'ve seen. However - you can\'t adjust its speed, you have to disassemble the unit partly to even see how it\'s wired up, and without disassembling the unit I also can\'t be sure if I would easily be able to replace a failed fan. I understand that it makes a nice look, but this all-encapsulated approach feels inferior from a flexibility standpoint to just having accessible mounts and a normal header that would work with any 80mm case fan.However, for now the stock fan works fine so the unit has no functional issues. I tried it with three Western Digital 10TB SATA drives (shucked from EasyStore enclosures) and an AsRock H97 motherboard running Proxmox. Formatting the drives for ZFS (a RAIDZ1 array) worked fine and performance was just as I\'d expect. I let the drives run for several hours just copying files back and forth with dd, and at the end they were only 35C so the fan is definitely up to the task at least in my normal-room-temperature environment.All considered, this is a nice unit. I was tempted to give it five stars, but I really don\'t like the possibility that the fan would fail and force me to make modifications at some point. Pretty much everything else is perfect, though.', 'During the pandemic I created a server in our basement for our home\'s entertainment center, and while we still have a considerable amount of memory to spare still, our data backup is on the verge of being filled up. This RackChoice three bay enclosure will allow us to significantly bolster our backup\'s memory and let me stop worrying about upgrading to a larger system.The unit is a pretty straightforward plug-and-play setup, there is really not much two it. It\'s just three bays lined up to engage with the SAS strips at the back of the unit, and a fan. The unit comes with the necessary screws to mount the hard disk drives (we used all 3.5"" drives) into the bays and then you just push them back in and lock them into place. Even though I think I could have gotten away with not having the fan going due to our server being our unheated but still temperate basement, I decided not to chance it and used both of the power connection slots and then ran the three provided SAS cables between this unit and our main backup system.The system spotted the three spun up drives immediately and I began the process to format them and integrate them into our backup system.It really is a VERY simple like modular add-on box for that badly needed bump in memory.***Overall Value***The biggest value is this unit\'s simplicity. As long as your primary system has SAS spots to spare, it\'s an easy add on with no tinkering needed. But if your server or NAS doesn\'t have the SAS or power source spots available to plug this in, you might need to supplement it with some additional components to make the connection and/or power this thing up. But if you\'re system has those spots open this is an easy, no frills ""done in 30 minutes"" project for $60.', 'This setup is slick and works really well, large bays are almost useless these days but with this conversion kit you can bring old server tech to your desktop to make it top of the line.', ""This product is perfect for adding hotswap bays to your workstation or server.  Since my use case is with SSDs, can't comment about HDD temps but the built-in fan should provide enough air flow to keep most drives running under 50C.  As with most hotswap bays if you do plan to use data center HDDs instead of NAS drives you're going to have the disk vibration noise being amplified by the PC case so you should use a thin piece of rubber or silicon to absorb that vibration with your PC's front case panel.The build quality is better than other bays I've used in the past, the quality is on par with hotswap bays on pre-fab NAS towers and should be durable for that level of usage.Overall this is a great option for hotswap bays for workstation or server setups, the backplane does look well constructed like enterprise hardware so I feel comfortable using this for NAS duty.  Highly recommended as this hotswap bay works with SAS drives when paired with a SAS RAID controller."", 'Nice and simple...This 3 Bays HDD Server enclosure is a smart choice for easy, no fuss expansion.The unit is well made with nice latching drive bay sleds and good sturdy construction.  It fit perfectly in my RackChoice 3u Chassis and all drives (connected with the included cables) were detected and responded as they should.  Indicator lights for each drive responded to activity...DONE.  No hiccups or conflicts...It worked without any hassle.', ""I've been running out of space on my server but didn't have any more drive slots available. I mounted this in the bottom of the PC case (lots of strong double sided tape) and installed a SATA PCIe card. HDD installation was easy and straightforward (done first of course) with all the necessary screws and cables included.Powered up the server, the drives were detected, and everything so far is working as it is supposed to. Hard drive temps are okay even though it is using air from inside the case. Overall this is a very easy almost turnkey solution to the problem of not enough HDD slots."", 'This is a great way to retrofit old cases with lots of 5.25"" space and not have to waste so much of it. It used to be common to have 2 or 3 5.25"" bays. Now 2 of those can hold 3 3.5"" drives. Each drive has an independent SATA connection, so theres is no shared backplane. Perfect for basic JBOD.', ""This requires two four-pin Molex-style power plugs. In exchange, you'll power all three drives and the included fan. The rack works with both SAS and SATA drives, passing through the SATA connector to the back of the rack.The drive trays are basic, but feel plenty sturdy. So far I'm really liking this.""]"

I purchased the 10 hard drive capacity and it did not disappoint.  I recommend putting hard drives in ESD (anti-static) bags before inserting into the case for added protection.  The drives fit very snug in the slots and the pink foam is the non-static generating type.  I highly recommend this for storing and transporting mechanical 3.5-inch hard drives.', ""So I am just going off what I have experienced whith E.S.D while working on assembly lines for servers. So far as I can tell the pink foam is E.S.D legit and the case is sturdy. I have no complaints as far as the supplier or the product it's self. The only thing I wish was different would have to be better planning on my own behalf. Also I would like to see for this product line to expand it's self to A.I.O cases that could accept different combinations, from external and internal drives and possibly flash, USB storage.-------------UPDATE-------------Well overdue, should have posted this long while back. So I have been able to not only get raw 3.5 hdd in to the spaces provided but I also can get my 2.5 ssd/hdd x6 per space as well as my old smartphones. But if someone wanted to try to fit a 3.5 external storage into the case one would definitely need to cut to fit the foam."", 'This is my second purchase. My intial review dropped a couple of stars because I felt that the slots weren\'t deep enough and that it felt like the drives were jammed in too tight. Well... I\'ve had a change of heart.The foam has loosened up a tiny bit over time and I\'ve come to see that ""tight"" is good. The drives aren\'t moving around inside the case and the perimeter foam is sufficient to take care of the bumps. The case itself is close, if not equal to, Pelican quality. With huge capacity hard drives dropping in price I doubt I\'ll need a third in my lifetime and fully expect these cases to last that long.', ""Would buy again.The foam is a little unevenly glued, but can't expect it to be perfect. I've moved with this for my hard drives and can report they all survived. Nice quality."", 'Perfect for moving twelve 3.5in hard drives or twelve items that are electrostatic sensitive that fit in a 3.5in ""hard drive like"" area. Case is rugged with the ability to lock each latched area with a standard lock. Expect a tight fit on items placed in the case, very little extra room if you have an oddly shaped piece of hardware.', 'Was moving and all my stuff would be in truck transit that would last half a month, and I got quite a couple HDDs with important data on them, so I decided to give this a try as it looked trusty. It did it job and all drives are in great shape. Other than price no complaints.', ""Excellent cases! Rugged and provide me with a level of peace of mind about my backup hard drives. I really can't imagine how these could be any better. They do cost some money, but I haven't seen any alternatives on the market that are anywhere near as good."", 'Great value. Fits bare 2.5mm internal drives but not portable external drives. Probably 75% as tough as a Pelican case at less than 1/2 the price of configuring a custom one with the correct cutouts and anti-static closed cell foam. Bought for durable drive storage in the office and very satisfied with the purchase!', 'Will buy again. Very nice case', 'I found this case to be the best value on the market for safe travel with my 2.5"" drives or SSDs. I\'ve used it on several jobs now and have also found it was quality built as well. It fits RED mini mags if you are working with that media.']"

Happy with this brand.- About packaging, as usual, it was the worst packaging by Amazon seller and they don't care so please note this. I received drive packet outside of its protective case within a very large box with very little packaging which was of no use. Drive would surely have bumped many times during journey within the box. Very careless logistic issue.""]"

Also nicht wie in anderen Rezensionen geschrieben nur im Amazon-Karton.Einsatzzweck:Die beiden Festplatten verrichten beide Ihre Arbeit in meinem NAS (Synology 916+). Die 4 TB-Variante in einem RAID1-Verbund, bei welchem eine HDD (WD Red, WD40EFRX) nach mehreren Jahren defekt war. Die 3 TB Disk als Einzellaufwerk für Systembackups.Die „WD Red Plus“ sind der Nachfolger der „WD Red“ und werden für den Einsatz in eben solchen NAS Systemen mit RAID gebaut, wie auch beim Hersteller und auf der Verpackung zu lesen ist.Genaue Bezeichnung:Geliefert wurden3 TB, Produktnummer WD30EFZX4 TB, Produktnummer WD40EFZXBeide Disks nutzen das sogenannte CMR-Verfahren (Conventional Magnetic Recording) zur Aufzeichnung (also nicht SMR - Shingled Magnetic Recording, welches schlechtere Übertragungsraten bedingt) und sind dadurch bestens für RAID geeignet. Das CMR-Verfahren kommt im übrigen bei WD Red Plus HDD bis 14 TB zum Einsatz, falls sich jemand die Frage stellt, ob bei höheren Kapazitäten ggf. doch auf SMR zurückgegriffen wird.Die Disks arbeiten mit 5.400 RPM recht leise und bieten 128 MB Cache als schnellen Zwischenspeicher (bei einer maximalen internen Datenübertragungsrate von 175 MB/s).Die Workloadrate, also die Menge an Daten die pro Jahr bei dem Laufwerk nicht überschritten werden sollte liegt bei 180 TB.Fazit:Wer also für sein NAS (oder auch seinen PC) eine Festplatte für regelmäßige Zugriffe (Random Access) als robustes Einzellaufwerk oder im RAID-Verbund sucht, kann diese HDDs ohne Sorge bestellen, da sie für den Dauereinsatz (24x7) gebaut werden und auch via Amazon in Originalverpackung (also nicht Bulk) mit 3 Jahren Herstellergarantie kommen.Eventuell andere Erfahrungen wurden ggf. mit anderen als den genannten Produkten gemacht. Leider ist hier nicht immer eine perfekte Produktzuordnung in Hinblick auf die Rezensionen gegeben.Und nein, ich bekomme die Platten nicht kostenlos, oder arbeite für WD, sondern bin nur ein normaler Kunde/Nutzer (wenn auch mit IT-Backround, beschäftige mich also beruflich mit Speichersystemen, was den Detailgrad meiner Rezension erklärt)', ""Après 2 ans seulement de bons et loyaux services, le disque dur de mon iMac 27 pouces 5K de 2017, de marque Seagate, a planté lamentablement. Impossible d’écrire sur le dernier secteur, donc le disque est mort. 2 ans, c’est vraiment un peu court pour un disque, même en fonctionnement constant.Après avoir envisagé de faire changer le disque chez Apple (en cassant ma tirelire), j’ai finalement trouvé sur internet un kit d’ouverture qui permet de décoller l’écran de l’iMac pour changer le disque qui se trouve derrière, et de recoller l’écran ensuite. Du coup j’ai décidé de me lancer.\u2028\u2028Restait le choix du disque. Le disque interne des Mac est toujours un Seagate. Cette marque a relativement bonne réputation, mais je possède dans mes deux serveurs depuis des années des Western Digital dont je suis très satisfait. Et la garantie chez WD est de 3 ans si on s’enregistre sur leur site.J'ai donc décidé de rester sur WD, et j’ai choisi un RED 30EFRX de 3 To car ces disques sont prévus pour fonctionner dans un NAS sous système Raid, et subir par conséquent des contraintes sévères en termes d’accès et de vibrations.Le taux de transfert à 6 Gigabits/s est plus essentiel pour les performances qu’une vitesse à 7.200 tours/mn (d’ailleurs la plupart des disques aujourd’hui, même haute performance, sont à 5.400 tours).Pour ceux que ça intéresse, le démontage de l’écran de l’iMac s’est fait sans problème avec les outils ad hoc fournis dans le kit. Le remplacement du disque est facile, il suffit de le réinitialiser ensuite au format APSF, puis d’installer Mac OSX ou de faire une restauration complète depuis Time Machine et le tour est joué. Si vous n'avez pas fait de sauvegarde, il vous reste vos yeux pour pleurer...Ne pas oublier de coller sur le disque la sonde thermique fournie avec le kit, car le Mac adapte la vitesse de ses ventilateurs à la température de ses différents composants, dont le disque dur.A noter enfin que ce disque WD Raid fonctionne parfaitement dans le cas d’un Fusion Drive, comme c’est le cas sur mon iMac, donc associé avec un SSD pour allier grosse capacité et rapidité en lecture et en écriture  : les 2 disques se complètent parfaitement à condition de suivre la procédure Apple pour reconstituer le Fusion Drive en un seul volume logique associant les 2 disques.N’oubliez surtout pas d’enregistrer votre disque chez WD pour bénéficier de la garantie de 3 ans par échange direct : il y a quelques années, j’ai ainsi retourné un disque sous garantie, et il m’en ont réexpédié un neuf sans même attendre d’avoir reçu celui qui était défectueux, conscients du fait qu’une panne disque est une vraie urgence pour le client. Chapeau !Je n'ai pas le recul nécessaire pour juger de la longévité de ce disque 3To, mais je possède déjà 4 disques WD green de 2To depuis 7 ans et 4 autres de 3 To depuis depuis plus de 5 ans en fonctionnement continu, et je n'ai eu qu'un seul incident sur un des disques 3To, immédiatement remplacé par WD. Donc j'ai confiance."", 'Comme dit quelqu’un c’est pas de l’OEM donc comme c’est une version boite on a un minimum de protection contre les chocs de la livraison par rapports aux colis Amazon pas du tout adapté au lancé de disque dur pratique par certains livreurs …Maintenant il serai bien que le CONSTRUCTEUR soit plus clair et surtout plus honnête et transparent vis à vis du consommateur car j’avais des wd RED ( de 2014 … donc on est loin du mtbf et des heures d’utilisation promises par le constructeur car c’est déjà le 2 eme qui me lache dans mon RAID 5) et j’ai faillit prendre ceux de base qui sont des SMR hors cette technologie n’est pas adapté aux NAS contrairement à ce qu’ils avancent … Sinology et autres constructeur de NAS confirme il faut prendre des des CMR. Les SMR  sont plus pour de la sauvegarde stockage et non accès vu la technologie … alors attention lors de votre achat prenez minimum un «\xa0plus\xa0» qui sont maintenant certifiés CMR contrairement aux premiers sortis …(c’est le bazard ….) , si vous avez des doutes allez sur les forum dédiés aux NAS il ont mis une liste dés disque CMR et SMR en fonctions des marques.', ""Un ottimo prodotto della vecchia guardia, essendo un 7.200 giri è molto veloce rispetto ai 5.400 che sono piuttosto lenti. La garanzia di questi prodotti è molto grande arriva fino a 5 anni il che vuol dire che è di ottima qualità. L'unica pecca che ho notato è che dopo un po' che non lo usi va in standby e bisogna aspettare qualche secondo prima di poterlo utilizzare, magari è possibile regolare questo tempo ed io non so come fare. Lo raccomando per chi ha ancora come me un vecchio pc che funziona con hard disk classici."", 'Prodotto come da descrizione.']"

The hard drive was automatically formatted, and started working right off the bat. The 8TB hard drive is has an approx. retention period of +30 days using (5) Ubiquiti G5 Bullets.', 'I have  used WD products for years and I am always pleased with the service and longevity of their products.', 'So Western digital representatives have told me over and over their video drives are great because of their endurance features.  And while I\'m sure those are fine, they are blurring the lines in the homes you don\'t notice they aren\'t really video hards drives, because they don\'t support the ata-8 standards.  They do respond to the ata-8 read requests, but when the drive starts to have read errors, rather than obey ata-8 and deliver the stream with a time priority, they stall the stream as they retry error correction over and over.  The ATA-8 Streaming command set is designed so a host system to request data within a specific window of time.  It places a priority on a time to transfer the data, rather than the integrity of the data.  This is important for video drives in DVR\'s.Other manufacturers combine video and surveillance features, and the drives are good in DVR\'s OR NVR\'s.  However western digital will tell you that your equipment isn\'t compatible with the drive.  Seagate, HGST and Samsung all make video drives that properly implement the ATA-8 standard.  By insisting to me that this is a video hard drive, rather than admitting it really isn\'t, is wasting all of our time and money.I purchased the 8tb drive on April 16th, 2020.  It has a Feb 16 2020 manufacturing date.  It started freezing the DVR within a month, and on June 28th the DVR just started rebooting every hour or so.  It is 20% full, haven\'t had it long enough to ever fill it with data.  The house is between 68 and 72 at all times, and the fan of the DVR has direct access to room temperature air.  The drive runs warm, but Western Digital\'s rep just got finished telling me how good this drive is in hot environments, and that it has no limits to how much heat it can handle.I asked the rep if this was an actual video drive, and before I finished explaining what I meant by that, he launched into a memorized sales-pitch where phrases like ""withstanding unlimited heat"", and emphasized the durability of the drive.  It is very clear that they spend a lot of time defending the purple drives, and are very good at extolling their virtues.  I have no doubt everything he said was true, I know and trust WD hard drives, in my day job I build massive SAN systems entirely based on WD hard drives.  I love the brand, but their video drives are for surveillance and normal data use ONLY.  They are not good for your directv video DVR.  They are NOT ata-8 compliant video hard drives.  They only work in video DVR\'s when the drive is running perfectly.  As soon as it starts to generate late video frames due to error correction, DVR\'s that require ATA-8 behavior will start locking up and/or crashing.I love western digital drives in general, but their surveillance drives are awful in DVR systems.', 'For anyone wondering after formatting Total drive space on my lorex NVR was 7.27 TB. Thats a heck of ALOT of data for me anyways.One thing to note. This drive being 7200 RPM does ""wind up"" faster and louder than ""standard"" 5200 rpm drives. when its running its also defiantly louder than the previous drive i had installed but, its not that loud, but it is noticeable, if that\'s an issue.I specifically choose WD because out of all HDD i have ever owned my WD drives seem to never fail, so I\'m hoping for the same quality i have gotten from them in the past.I have gone through many ""reliable"" brands but in real world conditions, i have found WD to be the longest lasting drives out there.  I still have a WD velociraptor from like 2008 or something stupid like that. Still alive and still working.If anything goes wrong with this drive will update this review, but i probably wont need to because these WD drives are built to last.', 'These drives are being used in a UNVR-Pro, 7 bay network video recorder. All cameras are being recorded without dropping any footage. Simultaneous playback while still recording works well. No errors reported. I am not a fan of Western Digital, but thoroughly recommend these drives for surveillance applications. Especially with the Unifi UNVR-pro.', ""Bought this drive for a media server. Had this less than 2 months and it basically constantly clicks, even when no data is being read/written to the drive. I have monitoring software and scripts running to potentially predict failure but kind of annoyed that a ~$300 WD drive is doing this this early. I have always had faith in WD drives, had several WD Blues that lasted over a decade. Maybe WD purple drives are just crap or its just going to click but last, either way doesn't leave me very confident in leaving data on it. Recently bought a 8 TB WD Red and it is silent. Also bought a slightly cheaper Toshiba 8TB NAS drive which is also running fine so far.If you're looking at this, buy a WD Red Pro instead; close to same price. It is a NAS drive instead of a SURV drive but from what I can tell the biggest difference is that a NAS drive is optimized for random read/write where SURV drives are optimized for streaming (hence why i got one for a media server), both are suitable for 24/7 operations and at the end of the day they are still both HDDs so I doubt its a night/day difference between the two. I have been able to stream (multiple users) 4k and/or 30GB+ BluRay rips off both of these drive types with no observed difference in performance."", 'Luckily Hard drive works as expected so far. The shipping was horrible. I dont know who boxed this thing up but you simply do not place a hard drive in a box and ship it without any packaging material of any kind. Just a hard drive flopping around in a box. Box appeared to be flung into my front porch as well. Delicate electronics need to be properly packed.', 'I have bought 4 of these drives. The first a 4TB was nice and quiet for five months then started making the loud clicking noises. I changed it and paid for an 8TB. Like the 4TB it arrived in a thin foil wrapper and a snug card envelope. No bubblewrap, box, nothing. It made grinding noises and was like sitting on an aircraft listening to the air-con. I exchanged it for another 8TB and it too was poorly packaged and noisy with constant clicking. Amazon tech said the 8TB ought to be as quiet as the 4TB; however, a closer look and 4TB runs at 5400 rpm, but once you get to 8TB they jump to 7200 rpm, which has to be noisier. I gave up and ordered a 6TB (biggest at 5400 rpm) in the retail packaging and some other items to guarantee it also came in a larger box. 6TB is as quiet as the 4TB, but I will not gamble with the cheaper one with the zero protection again.', 'WD reseller, always had good luck and if I had any problems RMA was easy.', ""I've had MANY WD drives over the years, both internal and external.  Their quality is why I never changed brands (although now I use Seagate for my externals).  I've had more WD Caviar Black's than I can even remember and they all worked great and silently and still do.  The WD Green that I was using in our surveillance DVR before this was also silent.  When I got this WD Purple because it was specifically a surveillance DVR hard drive I expected the same level of quality.  Unfortunately, this drive is constantly making grinding, chugging noises that are quite loud.  We have to turn whatever we're watching up louder to drown out the noise of this hard drive chugging away.  I don't know if this is a sign that the drive isn't going to last long but it already sounds like it's on its last leg right out of the box.  For the price it should be the same quality as the WD Black's and those are silent.""]"

So I ordered this HD cable as a replacement. I find it easier to get the COMPLETE ASSEMBLY WITH SLEEP BRACKET already attached (this style) I find it worth another 4 bucks as the cable part is tiny to get into the old bracket. I replaced cable with this one. I also reinforced / protected with some black electrical tape covering the cable on top. I was able to install OS, booted up immediately.

Cada vez que trato de acceder a él el PC aleatoriamente se congela durante 2-5 minutos.  Ejecutado el programa de diagnostico de WD este muestra sectores erróneos y no es capaz de pasar la prueba SMART.Tengo por ahí discos WD de hace 15 años de portátiles antiguos que aun siguen funcionando correctamente y estos nuevos no aguantan ni un año. Para mi el descenso de la calidad/fiabilidad de los productos WD es más que evidente.Respecto del servicio de Amazon inicialmente ""los expertos"" me remitieron al servicio técnico de WD, donde abrí un caso de soporte. Ante la falta de respuesta por su parte de WD, Amazon me volvió a contactar y me gestionaron un reemplazo. UN 10 PARA AMAZON, sin embargo me da a mi que fue una excepción porque, su política actual parece ser derivarte siempre al SAT del fabricante. Esto no me parece mal si este funcionara bien y fuera gratis para el consumidor, cosa que leyendo la web se soporte de WD no parece ser el caso ya que el envió al SAT corre a cargo del comprador. Si estas pagando el PRIME y el producto esta en garantía esto no me parece correcto.Conclusión: la calidad de WD no es la que era y si lo encuentras máss barato en otro sitio plantéate cómpralo, total, si tienes problemas durante la garantía legal hay una muy  alta probabilidad de que tengas que lidiar con el SAT del fabricante y entrar en esa incertidumbre del penoso servicio a distancia que suelen dar las empresas en España y que es la razón de triunfo de Amazon por estos lares.Nota: también comentar que el disco sin ser lento tampoco es rápido y yo no lo usaría como disco para el sistema operativo, ni para juegos, solo para almacenamiento de fotos y ese tipo de cosas.

The package  just includes the gears and housing, no mounting bracket as shown and no motor. Turning the main gear by hand there is a spot in the rotation in which I can feel a little friction/rubbing, but nothing major that I wouldn't expect to wear in with time and it may just be a set screw being a little proud, still though for this high end extruder I would expect the smoothest operation possible. I checked the filament feed as I had read in an other review that it was not the correct diameter but had no issues with mine. Other than it not being complete as shown and the light friction on the turn  the product appears very high quality, durable. clean, precise, and lightweight and was very nicely packaged in custom foam.I was greeted with a full list of helpful FAQ's in an email from the seller as well as a card with a link provided in the box. I enjoy the reassurance the dual gear drive provides and as I continue to tune and refine my printers eliminating fail-points and variables in moving parts is essential to piece of mind when printing big pieces or important ones. Overall I am very happy with this purchase but will have a better idea after a few months of printing."", 'Outstanding extruder. Purchased for my rostock max v3. It bolts directly onto a nema17 motor and it\'s geared so you get way more ""torque"", but not as much max speed. Speed isn\'t really important unless your running a bowden, adds a few seconds to swapping filaments (i\'ve got a long bowden tube with the rostock). Driving force is unreal, but be careful, you can easily extrude too hard. I had a jam, and the driving force was enough to pop out the bowden tube, causing it to just airprint.  It\'s not as easy to clean out if you don\'t have enough room, so make sure you can open the armature 90 degress to the body and be able to look inside.Another VERY important, note, the drive gear that fits on the Nema 17 has to be ""backwards"" where the grub screw is farthest away from the NEMA17 motor body, otherwise you\'ll strip the plastic teeth on the inside. The contact between the gear and the nema shaft is very very close to the body of the motor.Another great thing is that due to the gear reduction, you can run a much smaller NEMA17 motor, so if your looking to lighten up your hotend, this is also a good option if you pair it with a E3D hotend (direct attach). If you use bowden, then you\'ll need to purchase a grovemount bowden adapter as well.', ""Finally got tired of using cheap Chinese extruders that just don't work or last for a short time. It was a night and day difference when I first used this item. I don't have to worry about filament not feeding in and thru the extruder anymore. It doesn't crush the filament and is very precise. The steps/mm are given to you. I truly regret not spending the extra money and buying this sooner. No more headaches and it feeds any type of filament.  Do yourself a favor and buy this. Your prints will look better immediately. I got a genuine E3D V6 to go with this and I'm so happy with the quality of my prints."", 'Don\'t believe the hype! I received this extruder yesterday and I had high hopes for its performance. After installing it and configuring the steps/mm etc in Marlin, I proceeded to load the filament, I was excited to see how the ""easy\' loading went. When I tried to load the filament I noticed it was extremely hard to push the filament into the hole and I had to use the LCD to move the extruder to load the filament. Right away it was struggling to push filament through. I tried different filaments and had the same problem. That\'s when I took it apart to see what the problem was and I noticed that the hole was way too small (measuring 1.74mm). I needed a pliers to pull 1.75 filament through the hole. For the price of this extruder the tolerance should be dead perfect. To make a long story short, I drilled the hole out and it works perfectly now. I shouldn\'t have had to drill a brand new extruder though. I probably could have printed the clone of this extruder and had a better experience, and that would have cost pennies worth of filament.  Not happy at all... even though it does work great now.', ""Highly highly recommended. Seriously, I fought extruders for way too long before buying this. It was like seeing the light. Technically why is it better? The dual hobbed teeth grab the filament from both sides and it's geared down 3:1 for maximum torque. It also looks like the hobbed gears (the pushing gears) also ride on needle bearings which would be incredible build quality if true. Very much worth the $80."", 'Had trouble making myself order these due to price as compared to other extruders.  VERY worth it.  Printed flex on a big delta that has over 1 meter of bowden, printed flawlessly.  Also fantastic in daily use with PLA, etc.Converted from an E3D Titan.  I will never go back.', 'I have had my Monoprice Maker Select for 3 years and have done many upgrades but putting a Bondtech extruder on it was the best thing I ever did. I wish I had done that first.', 'Love this extruder! I have it mounted on my FT5 printer.']"

Wären da nicht die Preise pro GB die ein ziemliches loch im meine Geldbörse reißen! Zu dem ist es so das nicht alle Spiele von der Performance einer SSD wirklichen nutzen ziehen und mir deshalb der hohe Preis immer ein dorn im Auge war.Tot geglaubte leben länger....So oder so ähnlich dachte ich als mir ein Kumpel erzählte er hätte sich eine Beschleunigte Platte gekauft die deutlich fixer seine Spiele läd als vorher... Ich war neugierig und lies mir den Link schicken und Stante nicht schlecht des es sich um eine relativ neue Serie von Seagate handelt und es sich vor allem um eine SSHD (Solid State Hybrid Disk) handelt. Ich fand das Konzept damals schon stimmig und hatte eigentlich immer das Gefühl das es sich um eine Tolle Technik handelt die aber bestimmte Einsatz Bedingungen erfordert um sein Potenzial auszuschöpfen.Wie sehen die Bedingungen aus???Quasi ist das einfach erklärt... diese art von Festplatten merken sich häufig wieder kehrende Daten, die wiederum in einen der Hard Disk vorgelagerten Cache geschrieben werden, der wiederum extrem schnell gelesen werden kann.Gerade für HDD\'s ist es ein Problem wenn sie viele einzelne fizelige Datein lesen muss, quasi die ganzen einzelnen Texturen, Sounddaten usw. Sachen die halt bei vielen Ladevorgängen immer und immer wieder anfallen aber den Ladevorgang bei einer HDD extrem ausbremsen weil es richtiger Stress für die Festplatte ist so extrem viele einzelne Dateien finden, anfahren und Lesen zu müssen! Genau diese kleinen Dateien die so extrem Bremsen und für eine HDD so aufwendig sind zu verarbeiten, werden in den vorgelagerten Cache geschrieben. Die größeren Dateien die auch die HDD gut verarbeiten kann werden weiterhin von dieser gelesen.So kommt es das der im Verhältnis zur eigentlichen HDD mit 2 TB, relativ kleine NAND Cache mit 8 GB völlig ausreichend ist und nicht wie von vielen behauptet mit einem Spiel völlig ausgeschöpft ist!Das Ergebnis...Aufgrund der vielen negativen hinweise die einem die allwissende Googel so vermittelt habe ich nicht viel erwartet und bestenfalls mit einem großen Datengrab gerechnet.... ich habe jetzt für euch nur eine Antwort:VERGESST DEN GANZEN SCHEIß DEN IHR ÜBER SSHD UND SPIELE GELESEN HABT!!!Mit statischen Benchmarkt wie dem ""Crystal Disk Mark 5"" ist die Leistung einer SSHD schwierig dazustellen, die Ladezeiten bei Spielen sind teils deutlich reduziert! Wenn alles gut läuft liefert die ""FireCuda 2TB 3,5"" mit 7200RPM"" mit guten 230MB/s in der Spitze richtig gute Ergebnisse, gerade diese fitzeligen Dateien haut die Platte mit 3 mal besseren Ergebnissen raus ... aber alles das spiegelt nicht das wieder was ich bei einem ""GHOST WILDLANDS"" (kurz GWL) erlebt habe wieder...In der GWL Closed Beta hatte ich das Spiel auf meiner Spinpoint die im schnitt mit 115-121MB/s ihre Arbeit verrichtet. Dort waren die Ladezeiten absolut nervig lang, selbst die Schnell reise war extrem nervig und hat teilweise locker über 20 sek. gedauert! Der erste Start in die Welt hat gefühlt eine Minute in Anspruch genommen. Das Spiel wurde völlig entnervt auf meine SSD (Crucial MX100 mit wirklich guten 560MB/s) aufgespielt damit ich endlich normale Ladezeiten haben kann. Blitzschnell war das immer noch nicht aber die Schnellreise war nach 7-8 Sec. erledigt und es stellte sich sowas wie ein Spielfluss ein.Nach diesen Erfahrungen habe ich die GWL Open Beta gleich auf die SSD installiert und dort war zumindest die Welt Ladezeit nochmal von Ubisoft verbessert worden, die Blitzreise war wie gewohnt im schnitt zwischen 7-8sek erledigt.Dann holte ich mir extra für meine ganzen Spiele diese ""Seagate Firecuda 2TB 3,5"" 7200RPM"" und überspielte alle meine Spiele ausnahmslos auf die Firecuda auch ""GWL Open Beta"". Das sollte der ultimative test werden ob SSHD Laufwerke bei Spielen wirklich was bringen oder eben nicht! Meine HDD war ja schließlich hoffnungslos mit dem Titel überfordert (und ich bin mit Sicherheit nicht der einzige).Die ""Ghost Wildlands Open Beta"" performance...Ich halte die Platte seit diesem Test immer noch für ein Kleines wunder zu diesem Preis! Nach wiklich kurzer lernphase des vorgelagerten Caches ging im wahrsten sinne die Lutzi ab.... Die Welt Ladezeit war evtl. 1/4 langsamer als mit meiner SSD aber über doppelt so schnell wie mit meiner Spinpoint! Der ober Hammer sind die Blitzreisen.... mit der Uhr gestoppt zwischen 10-12Sek. also nur ca. 2 sek. langsamer wie mit meiner SSD aber über 15Sek. schneller wie mit meiner HDD!!!Das lässt sich in vielen Spielen wiederholen, wie z.B. The Division... Blitzreisen laufen bei meinem Kumpel auf der SSD mit ca. 8 Sek. mit meiner FireCuda im schnitt glatte 10Sek..Diese Lernphase ist nach 1-3 Ladevorgängen schon so deutlich das es egal ist ob man mehrere Spiele spielt. die Spiele laden nach ein paar Ladevorgängen reproduzierbar in dem hohen tempo ab. Spiele die aber aus SSD schon nicht so viel Ladezeit herrausholen konnten schaffen das mit einer SSHD natürlich auch nicht... aber ey ... wen nerven nicht lange Ladezeiten und wer will nicht viel Geld ausgeben??Ich habe nur ein FAZIT ... Perfekte Platte für Spiele zu einem absolut Fairen Preis mit absolut genialer Garantie...die beträgt mal eben 5 Jahre bei den FireCuda\'s', 'The drive performs as advertised. Arrived promptly as well.', 'I still use this drive after years of use and have not noticed any drop in quality of work and speed or files becoming disturbed.', ""Well it came time to upgrade my aging PC hard drive and I was originally going to get an SSD but after a lot of research I decided to opt for an SSHD instead....but why?The reason is that in theory at least the SSHD provides the sweet spot in cost versus speed versus volume.The right solution for you will depend on how you use your PC.I am primarily a gamer with a large library who tends to play a few games for a long time and this means that all I really need is a large drive capable of loading a few programs quickly and this is exactly what this SSHD provides.The relatively small amount (8GB) of NAND memory is enough to store and quickly load my Windows 8.1 OS and my favorite games.The SSHD uses built in algorithms to identify which files are used most often and stores them in the NAND for quick retrieval.So to get the most out of your SSHD as quickly as possible it's a good idea to reboot your computer and your favorite programs often during the first few days of use.This is what I have been doing for the past few days(about a dozen reboots) and I'm noticing a marked reduction in PC boot and game launch times already.So far my average PC boot time (power on to desktop) has went from 45 seconds to 36 which is fantastic and better than I could have hoped for and game launch times are also down although this is difficult to measure precisely but I'd guess about 5-10 seconds on average.Another benefit of this SSHD is the ease of installation. I purchased this to replace my stock 1 TB Toshiba HDD that has served me well these last two years and has a lot valuable data on it. The plan was to clone it and replace it with the SSHD  keeping the original as a backup.Everything went smoothly and after cloning it was very easy just to unplug and remove the old HDD from the PC and slide in the SSHD without the drama of caddies or adapters. All I had to do was plug in the SATA power and data cables and reboot the PC.To my relief the SSHD was instantly recognised by the BIOS and OS( windows 8.1) and booted as normal and all my precious files were there and working perfectly too!In summary this is a great SSHD at a very reasonable price and would highly recommend it to others IF they use their PC in the same way I do.So remember there is no one size fits all solution. The best product for you depends on how you use your PC, what speed you want/need and how much you are willing to pay.I hope this helps anyone planning to upgrade their HDD to make an informed decision. Good luck."", ""Guys, let's face it...2TB solid state drives are insanely expensive (over 500 USD). Even a 1TB SSD is around 250 USD (and this is for a low end model, WD Blue, 850 EVO, etc.). Why would you purchase a solid state drive for 250 USD today when in 2 years it's going to be half the price?! If you need lots of storage space for games, video, etc. but still want your OS and commonly used programs/games to load quickly... solid state hybrid drives are the way to go. My computer, which did have an enterprise grade 1TB HDD (128MB cache, 7200RPM), would take almost exactly 60 seconds to reboot. After installing this drive and using the computer for only 24 hours I have reached LESS than 30 seconds for the average reboot times.Most modern computer games are reaching WELL over 25GBs in size so paying over 500 USD for a 2TB SSD just doesn't fit most people's budgets. However, the SSHD option gives you both solid performance AND higher storage capacities. Honestly, I was a little skeptical at first with this technology but I am firm believer now after purchasing both the 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch models. I have to replace my drive every 2 years or so due to how much I use my computer. I don't want to pay 250 USD or more every 2 years for just 1TB of storage. For the average user, the option of the SSHD is ideal. I definitely prefer to buy a single 2TB SSHD and then have a normal, 2TB enterprise grade HDD for my backups.I see the point of having your OS and other smaller programs on a primary SSD then loading large sized games onto another drive however, an SSHD will give you the best of both worlds (with slightly decreased performance compared to the SSD of course) and you don't have to have two separate storage devices which simplifies things. Not to mention, I can get two of the 2TB SSHDs for just slightly more money than a 250GB SSD and a 2TB normal HDD. It's a pretty simple decision for me...if I can get these SSHDs for less than $100 USD I'm going to go with this option for now. When SSDs reach 150USD for the 1TB models I may give them another look. I don't see modern PC games getting smaller though over the course of the next couple of years though so... I think SSHDs are going to be a great option for many years to come!"", 'New review: Replacement came quickly, seems to work but you do need to plug it in directly to the motherboard- no SATA to USB cables worked with it in any computer. Works nicely, ssd makes a noticeable difference.Old Review: Looked very good when seeing all of the reviews online, both on Amazon and other videos/posts on various websites- so I bought it from Amazon and when it arrived (very quickly!) I was eager to test it out. Wanted to clone old hard drive on to it, using Macrium Reflect which lots of people use- but when I plugged in the Firecuda through a USB-to-SATA cable, it did not appear anywhere. Checked device manager, disk manager, Macrium Reflect- nothing. Plugged it in through different USB ports, nothing. Tried different devices (laptop, family computer) still not recognized.Logical step was to see if the cable was not working, so found 2 old hard drives and plugged them in to my computer with the same cable- immediately popped up, able to access both and browse in their files.If I wanted to, I could use the Macrium Reflect to clone the hard drive to these old hard drives which shows that it was not the programs fault either.I tried loads of ""fixes"" for it, using Tomshardware (which is a very good website for fixes) but none worked- tired booting computers up multiple times, plugging it in directly through the motherboard and using a SATA cable and the motherboard connector wire- briefly flickered up with some recognition but when I went to click on it through My Computer it was greyed out, showed no storage space and said ""Please insert disk into the drive""- again tried fixing it but every fix was not able to work as an error would appear saying ""If you want to do this, please insert disk"" etc.Might be just an individual case, so I have requested a new one and am sending back the old one! If it works I\'ll update the review. Really want it to work too, as old computer (used for gaming) is a HDD and is only 500GB! so a 2TB SSHD would be really appreciated.', 'The claims for the Firecuda series are that you get up to 4x (??) increased performance over a standard mechanical drive.  That may be true but it\'s hard to tell - you can see other reviews have the speed tests, and I don\'t need to go into that.  Seagate should have put more than 8GB of flash in these to make them even faster, but I\'m no engineer... it just seems a bit of a nickel-n-dime game to only use 8GB given how cheap SSDs are these days.  Anyway... 2TB of space is great.  I use it for mass storage of digital games (Steam, GOG, Ubi, Origin) as the second drive with an SSD as the main drive in my Windows PCs.  Ideally, it will speed up any small reads/writes (like game patching where it tries to do hundreds of small updates to a bunch of files - which brings a mechanical drive to it\'s knees) and otherwise perform as least as good as a 7,200 RPM mechanical drive (and from what I can tell so far, it does).  The number one feature to me is: 5 year warranty.  That said, 2TB drives typically cost less than the Firecuda.  I\'ve use the 3.5"" and the 2.5"" models as a ""mass storage"" drive in laptops and computers.  I\'d never run the OS on these... get an actual SSD for the main drive and use this as the extra drive.  Stay away from the 2.5"" models if you can - they are 5,400 RPM (i.e. slower) and depending on who you believe, that takes a way from the performance boost you can get.  I can\'t fathom WHY they keep making 5,400 RPM drives these days... other than reduced power consumption for laptops... they are too slow. Install your Windows OS on an SSD and you will never install it on a mechanical driver again... EVER!  Some people have said they get a good speed-up for Windows on the Firecuda as the main drive... but it was already too late for me... ""Windows goes on an SSD"" is my new rule.  So, for a mechanical hybrid drive that claims PERFORMANCE, the 5,400 RPM choice is rather silly in my book.  Regardless... 5 year warranty!', 'My favourite HD\'s were Samsung Spinright, I used them for years and I was very disappointed when Samsung stopped production, what I didn\'t know at the time was Samsung had sold their Hard drive division to Seagate for $1.4 Billion or so, and they had agreed a deal whereby Samsung continued to supply Seagate with NAND chips and Seagate provided Samsung with Hard Drives - All very well then, With the deal came Samsung\'s Hybrid HDD\'s and this produced the Hybrid \'Firecuda\' which is what this review is supposed to be about!Hybrid drives - as the name implies, combine two technologies, SSD (Solid State Drives) with conventional HD\'s (Hard Drives) and it does this with NAND flash memory chips built into the drive as a cache. (The NAND chip doesn\'t require power to retain the data).The objective is to deliver\xa0the superior speed of an expensive SSD, while retaining the higher capacity and lower cost of a conventional hard drive, in this case 8 Gigabytes of NAND RAM.\xa0 It does this using the NAND chips or non-volatile memory cache to store the data that its\' software tells it is most likely to be used and it works very well. I have for some time built SSD\'s into my machines for booting the OS and kept HDD\'s for less used data, the Firecuda is not as fast a solution but it is faster than using just HDD\'s, shortening boot times and data transfer noticeably quicker.I also noticed for the first time, a difference in the height of the 1TB drive over the 2TB which is very nearly 6mm; Seagate must be using different casings for different numbers of platters.  There is little other difference between the 1 or 2 terabyte drives except for the number of heads, the wattage used for standby and data transfer and the seek time which is understandably a little shorter for the smaller drive albeit 1 micro second.  The bigger drive also weighs in heavier by 65 grammes.  The price for two terabytes is around £100 for the 3½"" drive, however Amazon seem to have the edge from my not altogether exhaustive search at £90 all but a penny.  Considering the technology this feels about right with SSD\'s and PCI express drives commanding much higher price tags. This drive also has the advantage of an industry beating five year warranty, should I need to use it within this period, I will edit accordingly.JC', ""Bought this to replace a failing WD2003FZEX 2TB Black drive. Figured I'd try something a little different this time, and the benchmarks and reviews swayed me to this drive. I use it as a dedicated Game Installs drive and also do a lot of work with large amounts of small files. Modding and compiling my own projects with some particularly throughput heavy workflows.All the benchmarks I've run put this drive nearly in line with the(now failing) WD Black drive for raw performance. Never quite there but always at its heels. Of course the WD Black was more consistent and had higher overall throughput. But in practical usage, the Seagate FireCuda has been surprising. Level loads are much faster. Warping around in MMOs is so quick I can't read the loading screens. Initial loading of my 94GB Skyrim build is noticeably faster, and moving throughout Skyrim's world is more consistent. Streaming assets load more smoothly, and the loadscreens between areas are much shorter. Especially if you've been playing the game for a few hours. I wouldn't say there was a difference if it wasn't immediately noticeable. Raw performance might not be quite up to par with Barracuda Pros and WD Blacks, but practical usage definitely shows a different animal.Further, the FireCuda is MUCH MUCH quieter than the 2TB Black drive, has a roughly similar spinup time, and much better seek times. Accessing huge amounts of small texture files is at least as good in a worse case scenario, and much snappier than the Black drive when the FireCuda is in its stride. I imagine over the next few months it will build a thorough map of my usage patterns, and be a very consistent drive for me.This is my first Seagate for personal use in over a decade, and I must say I am impressed. Especially because it's a Hybrid drive. Long term longevity will be my real tell, but so far it does exactly what it says on the box. In my own real world usage this is every bit the drive the 2TB Black ever was, and CHEAPER. Great drive, at a GREAT price.""]"

On top of this, this drive is loud, much louder than WD Blue or even WD Red drives, and its considerable weight will make these sounds resonate more in your case. For this reason, I can't recommend it for desktop computers--it makes my PC much louder even with a Fractal case that features extensive sound deadening. It may keep you up at night."", ""I received the Western Digital Gold 4TB Enterprise Class Hard Disk Drive in what can be called a reasonable amount of time after ordering. However, upon opening the box, I noticed it was rather stingily packaged, simply put in a bag and sandwiched between the side of the box and a lonely square of bubble wrap. Although there was no outward appearances of defectiveness or damage, this concerned me. So I installed the drive immediately, formatted it, and lo a pleasant surprise: all was well. It had the proper capacity, speeds and functionality. All as advertised. Unfortunately, in fact all was not well.I noticed after a few hours that the drive was making small intermittent clicking noises. Ticks happening around every 6 seconds or so, quiet enough to not be noticed while playing music or videos, but just loud enough to be heard when things went quiet. I immediately ran a DSKCHK and 3rd part hard drive diagnostic software, suspecting the drive being faulty after all, only to find the drive had no known issues. I opened up the computer case and checked all surrounding drives, unplugging and testing to make sure it was indeed the new drive making the noise. With all other drives unplugged it became obvious the new drive was making the noise. But with no other problems that could be found with the disk, I decided to simply assume it to be a standard noise the drive makes in normal functions.Now, this may be an overreaction on my part; making a mountain out of a molehill as they say, but I absolutely, positively, cannot stand the noise this drive makes. I've tried to ignore it. Over the course of the first day I barely perceived it, easily drowning it out with a video or music, but now, it's all I can hear. It's akin to Chinese Water Torture, a simple tick, once every 6 seconds, 10 times a minute, 600 times an hour, driving me to madness. Once I truly began to notice the sound, it changed my entire way of life. Where I used to simply sit casually and enjoy some music or videos, I now have been forced by this cacophony to use headphones, hunched over in defeat,in an attempt to drown out the noise. My 350$  7.1 surrounds sound system sitting in silent, abandoned idleness . I have to force myself to not listen for it, using all my willpower to force it from my mind, which obviously doesn't work as I just notice it more and more each time it clicks. Even now as type this, I can hear it. The tick turned pound, blasting my consciousness away from relaxation and damning me to some kind of rhythmic hell!So as I do not have to time or money to hire ex-KGB operatives to train me in anti-torture methods I have decided to simply remove the drive and live my life with 4TB less space but an infinite amount a happiness more. I'm not certain if my drive is simply defective or my hearing is simply keener than everyone else's who bought this drive, but as things stand I simply cannot recommend the drive to anyone who owns one or more ears.Do not recommend. 2 stars."", 'First I would like to start out by explaining that if, like me, you bought one of these refurbished and it already has around 30,000 power on hours, you should know that these are rated for over 2 million power on hours, unlike most drives.These drives are meant for servers that are always on and Gold is the highest possible rating WD offers that I know of. The lifespan of one of these drives is likely to be over half a century.I bought one of these refurbished for only $48 and it only had 32,000 power on hours. For a lower rated drive that would be a lot of power on hours but for these that is nothing. This price was a steal so I bought 3 more and two of them only had around 8000 power on hours.WD Gold drives nearly never fail and the time between errors is over 2.5 million hours so for $48 you definitely want one of these. Even refurbished they are more reliable than any red or green rated drive on the market.', ""Bought during an upgrade from a two bay to a four bay Synology NAS along with a WD Red Pro 6Tb and joining two 3Tb WD Red standards. It was only whilst spending a bit more time reading reviews of the regular WD Reds that I discovered they are not equipped to dampen vibrational forces in all planes, so I decided to go higher up the quality chain and gain in MTBF whilst I was doing it.The Two Larger drives run hotter than the 3Tb drives both averaging around 46'C whilst their smaller counterparts are running closer to 37'C. The larger drives are lower down and the smaller drives sit at the top of the NAS so in a way I was expecting the heat to collect at the top, but after looking into the performance data I found that it's normal for Golds to run hotter and its still well within acceptable range. I've got monitoring and logging in place and will consider installing a large slow fan into the server cabinet to encourage a little upward draft through the stack and push the heat up the chimney running through the spine of the cabinet.From a Sound point of view I expected to hear more noise from the Gold disks based on reviews and migrating from two to four disks but in reality I've heard little to no difference from the NAS which is still only really audible when it spins up from sleep based on client access over the day, reaching a peak in the early hours of morning whilst backups and Raid Scrubbing tend to be carried out.Performance is improved, but I'm putting this down to the newer Synology box more than drive speed and I'd think it would only really be valid to start comparing identical RAID Configs using Identical Drive Arrays.I'll update any of my HDD reviews if I encounter any NAS issues over the years. I've a pile of spare space again now so do not expect to have to swap out drives for around 5 years or so when I will probably pull the 3Tb drives and replace with what ever size is economical at the time..."", 'I purchased this HDD expecting a new and unused item. However, upon testing the hard drive, I found that it had over 9000 power on hours, indicating that it had been used previously. I was disappointed to receive a used item when I had paid for a new one. I understand that this specific model is several years old, but I expected a new disk, not a used/refurbished one.While the hard drive appears to be functioning properly, I am disappointed that it was not in the expected condition.Please assume that it is used/refurbished. There was no data on the disk though.', 'We bought two of these Western Digital WD4002FYYZ 4 TB 3.5-Inch Hard Drives, to populate a NAS system.For those people who may be unclear about a NAS, it is a network-attached storage device, which holds one or more hard disks and connects into your network, giving other devices access to the stored content. This Western Digital WD4002FYYZ 4 TB 3.5-Inch Hard Drive – Gold, is well suited to be used in NAS devise. This drive, in particular, has a storage capacity of 4TB and has a substantial 128MB Cache.The accompanying bumf states “to make sure all of this data is kept safe the GOLD HDD’s are equipped with enhanced RAFF Technology which monitors the drive and corrects both linear and rotational vibration in real time, this along with the Multi-axis shock sensor and StableTrac Technology gives you peace of mind to know your data is safe”.In operation, the drive noise is better than OK and has a rotation speed of 7200 rpm. I must confess I am a western digital user when it comes to getting hard drives, or should I say populating a new NAS system.It is early days yet - nonetheless, I am happy with the Western Digital WD4002FYYZ 4 TB 3.5-Inch Hard Drive so far. I shall update if there any issues, hence my four-star rating.', 'Liked', 'Meine alte Festplatte (Seagate 1.5 TB) musste ersetzt werden. Die Wahl fiel nach einer Empfehlung auf die WD 4 TB Gold. Da die Platte für einen 24/7-Serverbetrieb ausgelegt ist und nicht für den Heimbetrieb in einem Tower-PC, knackst und rattert sie deutlich lauter als gewöhnliche Festplatten. Das muss man wissen, wenn man sich für dieses Modell entscheidet. Allerdings hilft es sehr, die Indizierungsroutine abzuschalten. Macht man das, führt die Platte in regelmäßigen Abständen einen Selbsttest durch, den man kurz hört. Je länger der PC an ist, desto länger werden die Abstände und die Platte wird leiser und hat längere Ruhephasen. Die Zugriffsgeschwindigkeit ist schnell. Die Drehzal ist 7.200 RPM und die Temperatur ist bei mir in Ruhelage 34° Celsius (normal). Bei WD sollte man die Platte online registrieren, das hab ich heute getan (dauert keine 2 Minuten) und die Garantie von WD läuft 5 Jahre. Hier eine Zusatzgarantie zu kaufen, ist darum überflüssig. Ankommen tut die Platte im Silberbeutel und nochmal in Knisterfolie. Der Einbau verlief problemlos. Dass das Teil lauter ist, wusste ich zwar vorher, aber ehrlich gesagt ist es noch etwas ungewohnt, aber mein Kollege meinte, in wenigen Wochen überhört man das. Die Qualität der Gold-Platte ist das gewichtige Gegenargument. 4 ehrliche Sterne und eine Kaufempfehlung.']"

Seguitemi e andiamo nel dettaglio:I dischi WD GREEN sono utili per l’utilizzo di storage, ma non sono adatti come dischi principali per l’installazione del sistema operativo perché non sono abbastanza veloci;Il WD Blue è indubbiamente la scelta migliore per chi vuole avere molta capienza e dispone di un budget limitato (come me), è perfetto come disco per l’archiviazione di grandi quantità di dati, fotografie, video e anche applicazioni che vengono utilizzate di rado. Integra la tecnologia NO TOUCH RAMP LOAD, il quale permette di proteggere i dati, prevedendo lo spostamento sicuro della testina di scrittura e e il suo posizionamento lontano della superficie quando non è in attività. Non vi consiglio l’acquisto se avete intenzione di utilizzarlo come dischi di sistema, visto l’avvento dei nuovi SSD(Solid-State Drive) di gran lunga superiori in termini di efficienza e performance. Vi consiglio di affiancarlo al vostro PC o Workstation come memoria di supporto in cui immagazzinare tutti i vostri dati (ad eccezione del sistema operativo che va su SSD). Il livello di velocità e di vibrazioni e di rumore di questo prodotto è nella media, la rotazione dei dischi si sente ma non è al quanto fastidiosa e comunque può essere eliminata grazie all’utilizzo di un buon case. La garanzia è di 2 anni e da quanto ho acquistato questo prodotto (a metà 2017) ad oggi, non ho ancora riscontrato difetti o malfunzionamenti;Il WD Black (Nero) invece a colpo d'occhio, sembra avere le stesse caratteristiche di questo Blu, ma esso è molto più veloce  sia in lettura che scrittura, grazie alla tecnologia\xa0Dual Processing. A partire dalla versione da 2 TB in su è presente anche la tecnologia\xa0Stabletrac che ne aumenta sensibilmente l’affidabilità. Si differenzia dal BLU per via del prezzo di molto superiore ma anche per la velocità pari a 7200 RPM, la Cache di 64 mb, la garanzia che è di ben 5 anni e infine per la sua maggiore rumorosità;Se avete sistemi NAS o DATABASE vi dovete buttare sulla versione RED (rosso) in quanto è appositamente progettato per questa funzione, essendo\xa0certificato per lavorare 24/7 e quindi tra i modelli più affidabili;\xa0 I WD PURPLE invece sono adatti per la videosorveglianza, prettamente come soluzione storage.Per quanto riguarda la capienza effettiva dei singoli HHD\xa0è diversa per ogni modello, essa può essere calcolata facilmente moltiplicando il numero di TB per 0.93, e in modo molto semplice e veloce si ottiene il risultato.IN CONCLUSIONE secondo l’utilizzo che ne dovete fare e il budget a vostra disposizione, scegliete la vostra configurazione ideale tenendo conto di quanto vi ho accennato. Io devo dire che sono rimasto davvero soddisfatto dall’acquisto di questo prodotto, che utilizzo sul mio pc in coppia a un SSD Samsung 850EVO. Pensate bensì che l’ho utilizzato anche per diverso tempo come memoria in un NAS, anche se non è adatto.La mia scelta è ricaduta su WD e non su altri marchi esclusivamente per via del prezzo, in quanto il più conveniente. Pagato un anno 70 € nel 2017.Nulla da eccepire sul servizio Amazon, imballaggio e servizio di spedizione perfetti.E quasi dimenticavo, vi consiglio di scaricare il software sul sito della casa madre, ACRONIS TRUE IMAGE WD EDITION per clonare il sistema operativo, le app e tutti i vostri dati sul vostro nuovo hard disk."", 'Note :For those of you confused that the drive is not detected is because all storage drives come with unallocated space by factory standard.

So loading heavy applications + OS is slow.3) Packing is only a flimsy plastic with even no bubble wrap/ hard cover.Conc :Recommended only for storing excess data.', 'Muy util como medio para ampliar el almacenamiento de un ordenador de forma económica.', 'Ottimo hard disk, ho preso il taglio da 2TB poichè sono convinto che è inutile prenderne uno  maggiore, se si dovesse guastare si perdono parecchi dati, piuttosto ne ricomprerò uno identico sempre da 2TB.Ad ogni modo, l\'hard disk è da 5400 giri con tutti i pro ed i contro che ne vengono fuori:PRO- longevità dato il minor numero di giri, usura minore delle componenti- bassissima rumorosità,  non si sente, bisogna avvicinare l\'orecchio per apprezzare un soffio.CONTRO- minor velocità di trasferimento...... Questo lo dico perchè lo dicono gli altri ma credetemi, per l\'utilizzo medio che ne faccio...va benissimo cosí!Ora vi riporto un po\' di numeri:Montato come hard disk interno e collegato in sata, il trasferimento dati (provo sempre un film da 1gb) da SSD a questo hard disk è di ben 110MB/s, non mi servono velocità maggiori, se proprio le voglio cambio categoria ed acquisto un SSD.Ma l\'uso che volevo farne era totalmente diverso:Montarlo su un box da 3,5 pollici e farlo diventare un hard disk esterno usb, con alimentazione dedicata. Sono contro gli hard disk esterni ""preconfezionati"" da 2,5 pollici, di qualunque taglio e marca, mi sono sempre trovato male, troppo fragili per i miei gusti.Quindi ho optato per questa soluzione, che sinceramente uso da 10/12 anni e non mi ha mai lasciato a piedi.Dopo tutti questi anni infatti ho deciso di dare meno fiducia al mio vecchio maxtor da 500gb anch esso montato su box esterno da 3.5, ci tenevo la mia vita li dentro.Adesso con questo WD da 2TB sono al sicuro, ho una copia di backup di tutti i miei dati che tengo a casa!!! Il trasferimento di file dall hard disk al pc (in usb 2.0) è di 29MB/s, non mi interessano velocità estreme.Attualmente il box è collegato 24 ore su 24 alla porta usb di un router tp link wdr 3600.In breve lo condivido nella mia rete lan per tutti i dispositivi presenti. Inoltre ho creato appositamente delle cartelle per i membri della famiglia in modo da avere anche loro il backup sicuro di tutti i loro dati. Ovviamente collegato alla porta usb 2.0 del router e dovendo trasferire file in LAN (fast ethernet delle mie schede) la velocità si abbassa a 12MB/s. Ma ancora una volta ho fatto streaming dalla tv e contemporaneamente dal cellulare e non ho avuto alcun impuntamento.UNA BOMBA', ""Dopo anni di onorato servizio il mio vecchio Seagate barracuda 12 mi ha lasciato, fortunatamente si sono danneggiati alcuni settori e sono riuscito a recuperare il grosso dei file. Ero indeciso se ricomprare seagate che, peraltro, costava 5 euro in meno alla fine ho scelto il WD Blue, che poi ho scoperto essere il vecchio green rimarchiato. Speriamo che sia affidabile nel tempo.Inizialmente ero tentato verso il modello RED pensando ad una amggior affidabilità, ma facendo un pò di ricerche ho visto che per un pc domestico che non è acceso 24h il Blue era più che idoneo, poi il red ha delle funzioni specifiche per configurazioni RAID. Ero titubante sulle prestazioni del 5400rpm poichè nell'ultima decade i miei dischi interni erano tutti 7200, ma devo dire che per l'uso che ne faccio è perfetto, ovvero archiviazione documenti, backup e file multimediali (video, foto, musica).E' silenziosissimo, le prestazioni sono dignitosissime ed anche i tempi di latenza mi sembrano buoni, nel complesso è più veloce del vecchio barracuda da 7200rpm, ma evidentemente il disco è nuovo, è poco pieno, non frammentato, insomma una serie di fattori che possono incidere ma io sono soddisfatto.Ormai sono circa 5 anni che per il sistema operativo uso esclusivamente SSD ed ora ne uso 2, uno per il S.o. e programmi, l'altro per i giochi. Francamente, una volta provato l'ssd non si può più tornare agli hard disk tradizionali, che però restano validissimi quandos erve tanto spazio, ad esempio ho una marea di film HD.Come consumi e riscaldamento non saprei, ma essendo un green rimarchiato dovrebbe essere parsimonioso. Comunque il tengo sempre i dischi dietro un bel ventolone per tenerli al fresco :)PRO:- silenzioso- parco nei consumi- perfetto per uso archiviazione file e multimedia- imballaggio ottimoCONTRO- problemi veri e propri non ne ha, semplicemente vi consiglio di non usarlo come disco primario perchè non solo è meccanico ma è anche da 5400rpm, vi consiglio caldamente un ssd da 256mb affiancato da un hard disk tradizionale per archiviazione.P.S.- una nota assolutamente positiva va alla confezione: mi aspettavo il solito HDD Bulk spedito in busta antistatica e pluriball, invece è arrivato in scatola di cartone della WD con all'interno le sagome di polistirolo protettive che bloccano l'hdd.- Venditore adognicosto velocissimo e puntuale (del resto spediva con prime)..."", 'Ich habe diese 2 TiB HDD im Dezember 2016 als Speichererweiterung gekauft, da mir die 1 TiB, die ich im PC hatte, nicht mehr gereicht haben. Ich habe eine 1 TiB Seagate Barracuda/Desktop HDD (7.200rpm, 64 MiB Cache) verbaut.Zuerst hatte ich vor wieder eine Seagate mit 2 TiB zu kaufen, allerdings habe ich viele Beschwerden über zeitige Ausfälle bei dieser gelesen, sodass ich mich hierfür für die Western Digital entschieden habe (weniger Beschwerden).Habe die HDD nun seit 2 Jahren und sie läuft immer noch, auch keine negativen Anzeichen laut S.M.A.R.T. Werten. Das freut mich, allerdings war die Performance von Anfang an (Bild 1) schon nicht so gut wie meine Seagate (195/190 MB/s Seq Q32), was aber zu erwarten war, und ist über die Zeit auch noch schlechter geworden (Bild 2, Benchmark von gestern) (meine Seagate ist immer noch schneller, obwohl älter und fast voll). Das stellt leider ein kleines Problem für eine Sache dar die zuerst einwandfrei funktionierte (verlustfreie Spielaufnahmen), aber eine HDD ist auch nicht unbedingt dafür gedacht - da kommt demnächst eine SSD dafür rein. :)Zur Lautstärke: Naja, es ist eine HDD, sind halt nicht lautlos wie eine SSD, aber finde es geht klar. Nach dem Einschalten gibt sie erst mal bei Zugriffen Geräusche von sich, nicht nur das initiale Klicken - was meine Seagate (noch) nicht macht, wenn ich mich recht entsinne - aber es scheint sich nach einer Zeit im Betrieb zu geben.Anmerkung zu den Benches: Normalerweise teste ich HDDs mit 2 GiB (bzw. GB?) Testdateigröße (weiß nicht ob das überhaupt gut zum Testen ist, aber so hab ich mal angefangen), aber bei dieser habe ich initial mit 1 GiB getestet, also der neuere Test zum guten Vergleich auch mit 1 GiB. Mit 2 GiB liegt die sequentielle Schreib- und Leseleistung jeweils ca. 5 MB/s darunter, 4 KiB Werte bleiben gleich, wie eigtl. auch zu erwarten ist.', 'I’ve been using it heavily since December 2021 and it is still usable', ""This is the hard drive only.

You'll only ever know if a disc like this works well if you are still using it in 2-3 years time. It is big and heavy but it does fit a normal sized SATA disc slot in a PC frame. I've had no problems but I perceive it as being a tad more noisy that the 3TB WD green disc that it replaced. As I have a strong backup protocol and I can afford to take a risk with a large density disc and see how it works. If this lasts OK then at least I will know for the future that I can move up to 6TBs as standard. All the normal good things about Amazon Prime in terms of next day delivery. Recommended."", 'Ich benötigte eine grössere Platte für mein NAS (OMV). Die speziellen Eigenschaften der Reds benötige ich nicht, da meine Platten nicht im RAID Modus laufen und auch die meiste Zeit im Ruhezustand verbringen. Die Reds sind eher für Dauerbetrieb ausgelegt, was aber nicht meinem Nutzungsszenario zuhause entspricht. Ich ziehe wöchentlich ein Backup von den Rechnern auf das NAS und abends streame ich mal einen Film über Kodi vom NAS auf den Fernseher.Als zufriedener WD Kunde kam demnach nur eine Blue in Frage, allerdings setzt WD  bei den neueren Blues wie auch bei den Reds auf SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording) statt wie bisher auf PMR (Perpendicular Magnetic Recording) oder auch CMR (Conventional Magnetic Recording). Hier kommen WD und die anderen Hersteller an physikalische Grenzen in Bezug auf die Speicherdichte die sie mit SMR umgehen. Ich habe über SMR nichts gutes gelesen, insbesondere was die Geschwindigkeit und Langlebigkeit anbelangt und dementsprechend war ich auf der Suche nach einer konventionellen PMR bzw. CMR Platte wie es bei der hier verkauften WD60EZRZ der Fall ist. Darüber hinaus lässt sich bei der WD60EZRZ noch immer das lästige Parken der Köpfe alle 8 Sekunden (IntelliPark) mit idle3ctl unter Linux problemlos deaktivieren um den Verschleiß der Mechanik zu reduzieren. Des weiteren versetzt hdparm die Platte zuverlässig und nach gewünschter Zeit in den Ruhezustand was mir sehr wichtig ist um Strom zu sparen und den Verschleiß weiter zu minimieren.Die Platte habe ich direkt von Amazon erworben um kein Risiko mit irgendwelchen zwielichtigen Händlern einzugehen. Dafür nehme ich auch einen geringen Aufpreis gerne in Kauf. Die Platte kam verschweißt und tadellos Verpackt hier an. Ein kurze Überprüfung der Seriennummer bei WD ergab auch zwei Jahre Garantie seitens WD was ich ok finde. Erfahrungsgemäß fällt eine Platte entweder relativ schnell aus oder hält deutlich länger als zwei Jahre. Zumindest war das bei mir immer der Fall. Eine WD10EACS verrichtet beispielsweise seit über 12 Jahren zuverlässig ihren Dient bei mir, mal abgesehen von den Problemen mit dem Ruhemodus in Zusammenspiel mit hdparm bei diesem Modell.Die Inbetriebnahme verlief reibungslos und die Platte verhält sich beim Umkopieren der Daten von meiner 3 TB Green (WD30EZRX) vom Datendurchsatz, der Geräuschkulisse und der Temperatur her absolut unauffällig und entspricht somit exakt meinen Erwartungen.', 'Es handelt sich bei diesen Platten offenbar um OEM-Festplatten. Das heisst, WD gibt dafür keine Garantie. Man hat also lediglich einen Garantieanspruch gegen den Verkäufer (gesetzlich 2 Jahre). Da es sich jedoch in diesem Fall um Amazon handelt, sollte während dieser zwei Jahre ein Garantiefall gewohnt kulant gelöst werden. Darüber mache ich mir also wenig Sorgen.Ich benutze diese Festplatte bei mir nur zum Speichern von Daten. Mein Betriebssystem (Win 10, 64 bit) läuft auf einer SSD. Ich hatte vorher die WD Black und eine Toshiba. Die WD Black gab nach einem Jahr den Löffel ab und bescherte mir in zunehmendem Maße laute Lese- und Schreibgeräusche, so dass ich die Platte ausgetauscht habe, bevor nix mehr geht und 3TB Daten futsch sind. Dann holte ich mir die Toshiba N300 8TB - HDWN180EZSTA hier bei Amazon für EUR 222,00.Die war dann schon von Anfang an genauso laut, wie die WD Black zum Schluss. Daher musste die dann auch wieder zurück ins Päckchen. Da ich unbedingt einen ruhigen PC haben möchte, ohne die ständige Rödellei der Schreibköpfe hören zu müssen, habe ich dann letztendlich die WD Blue genommen. Eine WD Green 2TB ist schon einige Jahre ohne Probleme in Betrieb und da die WD Blue ja der Nachfolger der Green ist, hoffte ich auf eine leise Platte.Und ich wurde nicht enttäuscht. Man hört sie kein bißchen. Nun ja, sie ist jetzt kein Rennpferd, eher ein Muli, aber die sind ja bekanntlich sehr ausdauernd. Der Benchmarktest ergab 140 MB/s Lesen und 150MB/s schreiben. Die Toshiba bestand diesen Test mit 220 MB/s. Soviel zum Unterschied in der Performance. Mir ist aber ein leiser PC wichtiger. Für die etwas flache Geschwindigkeit gibt es jedoch einen Punkt Abzug.Eins noch: Das erste mal seit ewig und drei Tagen war ich enttäuscht von Amazon. Die Platte kam sage und schreibe ohne nennenswerte Polsterung in einem einfachen Pappumschlag an. Im ersten Moment wollte ich sie zurück schicken, da ich meinen Daten nicht wirklich böse bin. Aber es sind ja zwei Jahre Garantie drauf, deshalb versuche ich es mal und mache zur Sicherheit ein Backup.Nachtrag 26.04.2019:Die Platte ist bei mir immer noch in Gebrauch, immer noch leise, immer tadellos. Immer noch etwas langsam :-)).', 'Rezension für WDC WD60EZRZ:Ich habe diese Festplatte für meinem PC am Fernseher im Wohnzimmer gekauft. Mein Exemplar kam von Amazon Warehouse Deals und hatte nur wenige Betriebsstunden laut den S.M.A.R.T.-Werten. Ich habe die Festplatte mit dem Testprogramm ""HD Tune Pro"" mehrere Tage am Stück diversen Tests unterzogen und konnte keinerlei Probleme feststellen. Die Lautsärke der Festplatte ist sehr angenehm und nur wahrnehmbar, wenn man das Ohr direkt an\'s PC-Gehäuse hält. Das einzige Problem mit der Festplattentechnik allgemein ist, dass die Übertragungsraten nicht mehr steigen, vor allem bei den großen Modellen. Um diese 6 TB Festplatte mit Zufallsdaten zu füllen, musste ich 700 Minuten (11,6 Stunden) warten. Wären es viele kleine Dateien gewesen, hätte das sogar noch deutlich länger gedauert. 700 Minuten entsprechen einer durchschnittlichen Übertragungsrate von 142 MB pro Sekunde. SSDs schaffen das schneller, aber kosten auch deutlich mehr. Man sollte sich vor dem Kauf also immer genau überlegen, was man mit dem Gerät vor hat.

I am very happy that I was able to upgrade now I have over 500GB free. However, I ran into an issue with Safe Mode, which is step 3 in the manual. They do not tell you that you will need to reconnect your controller because the PS4 needs to have a secure connection with your controller to navigate the menu in safe mode. This is where I encountered my issue, after researching online some found that changing between multiple usb cables worked, some simply reset the controller, and some unplugged and reset. None of this worked for me, after searching more I found a forum where one person said that the controller has been ""bricked."" After multiple tries I gave up and decided to through my controller away, since my new spare one worked immediately when I plugged it up. I have never had this happen, my controller worked fine just not in safe mode which is retarded. So if you don\'t encounter this issue then you will be fine, just know that on step 3 when you have to reinstall the software, the PS4 will require you to connect your controller by usb, then you will see the menu and choose option ""7."" I am not blaming this company for this issue, its all Sony. I wanted to mention this in case someone else ran into this issue, if you do then most likely your controller will no longer work. I just bought me a new one so I can have my spare, thank goodness that I had it! Also, if your a PS Plus member then you don\'t have to download your game saves on the supplied 8GB usb flash drive, you can just upload all your saves. However, you will need the flash drive to download the .PUP file from playstation.com and make sure when you download the file that it is 837MB is size, NOT 258MB that is just the update. You will still need to reinstall all of your applications and themes, but its worth it.

Make suRre youdownlosd the right update file from PlayStation.com. It is the 1 all the way at the bottom or when you click the link at the top for installing new hard drive. It should be 800 megs not the 300. Once installed you should have about 860 gBs of free space.  I recommend this over a 2 TB at this pount because the 2TBs run at the same RPMs as the 500 GB that comes standard with the ps4 and after doing some research have been known to have problems and for most people over 850 GB should be plenty unless you plan on installing every single 1 of your games. I suggest jjst installing games you crrently play or plan on playing.  I have 19 games installed at the time of this writing and stll have over 300 GB free space. My install times are a little faster and my ps4 overall runs smoother. I know a lot of people would sauy get a 2 TB hard drive but most have been known tio make a beeping noise after awhile and crash after about a year of use.

Just don't use the 300 mb update! I have about 10 games, 2 of which are downloads, and I had 497.5 gb left. This is fine for me as I tend to trade in most games. However, if you have a lot of games that you keep on your hardrive, you might want to consider going with 2 TB. I may do that in the distant future. Keep in mind that you will have to copy your game saves, as everything will be deleted. I got this around 4 pm and it took until after 10 to get all my games reinstalled. The actual hardrive install took about 20 minutes tops.

I fought with my ps4 slim for several days trying everything to fix the system after my hard drive failed after doing a ps software update. I only had the console for 15 months but use it daily.

My windows 8.1 wouldnt let me rename the computer file name without having a number after the file name, but on the flash drive I WAS able to correct the file name after copying the download file from the computer memory to the flash drive. it made my day and saved me from buying a new game console.

I used a different USB drive for each user so I didn't get the data mixed up, but you can use just the one it comes with by transferring each user's data to a computer in between backups.3.) The backup data won't load back on the PS4 unless you have installed the game first (this took me a second to realize). So just put the game in the drive until it says Start under the icon on the screen then eject it and load another. It ques the updates automatically and you don't need to wait for them to update to load saved data.Again, this was super easy and took me about 45 minutes from start to finish including loading all the user data back on the PS4.

But no complaints.', ""I probably should have forked over the extra cash the first time I upgraded my ps4. Previously, I bought a FAT32 1tb 5400rpm hard drive for about $60. It had no instructions and I had to buy an external hard drive that was FAT32 because I had over 100gb of save files and they don't make flash drives over 64gb that are FAT32. long story short, I couldn't get my save files to that new drive and it took a severe dump after 2 months giving me a physical damage to hard drive code. When I saw this bundle the first time I overlooked it because of the price. This time I just went with it and I was blown away!! The instructions are ridiculously easy to follow, I didn't have to buy extra tools to transfer data, the data from my original drive transferred over within 5 minutes, I still have the data to that point backed up and My original hard drive isn't just lying around any more. Fallout 4 runs great with it as do all my other games and I don't have to downsize my game library!!! game downloads and updates seem to install faster too.""]"

This works as a third hard drive, using another product I bought here on amazon. I'll post the link near the bottom. This way I don't have to take out my external hard drive while at the airport, long drives, client meetups, etc.Keep in mind:This drive runs at up to 6Gbps because of its SATA-III technology. If your laptop's SATA bus is SATA-I or SATA-II, this drive will not perform at its best. General rule of thumb: your linked devices work as fast as your slowest component. So if you buy this drive, make sure your computer can take advantage of the SATA-III bus.Because the drive is always spinning, it will drain your battery faster. This is specially true if this is your second or third drive connected to your laptop.It can be a little noisy when it's in use (small hiss from the spinning) but it's almost on par (maybe quieter) than the cooling fans. It's no big deal during the day, but at night when everything is quiet, is easy to hear it.The video I'm posting was edited from this new hard drive. As opposed to the previous hard drive I worked on, there is a significant improvement in performance while editing (1080p, 2.7k and 4k). Playback, rendering and publishing is definitely less stressful, without the long waits for it to finish (as compared to the 5400 RPM SATA-II drive I was using prior to this one).if your computer has SATA-I, the disk will run at up to 1.5Gbps <- hardly seen anymoreIf SATA-II, up to 3Gbps <- Common on budget laptops. SSD and SATA-III drives will hardly see any performance improvement.If SATA-III, it'll run up to 6Gbps <- what you want for this drive to perform at its best.Aside from speed, the 5 year warranty was definitely one of the major selling points when I bought this drive. Make sure you register it as soon as you get it. The warranty runs from the moment you bought it (not the moment you received it). I am definitely able to edit video and VR faster while using my laptop and this drive.Other Information:I like WD drives for ages. I only buy other brands if I have no other choice, but for the most part, I trust the brand better than the rest.SATA-III 7200RPM at 6Gbps definitely make a difference with video and VR editing; but I might just buy the blue 7200 RPM SATA-III drive variant for regular storage, imaging and web work.A second or third black drive may kill my battery way too quickly.And for the main drive, I'll definitely replace it for an SSD of at least 512GB.While this drive is definitely great for being a primary hard drive, I suggest you get an SSD for your OS and Software, and use this one for storage and projects, specially if you deal with video and very large files, ASSUMING you are able to install more than one drive in your computer...I bought this through Amazon Prime, so I knew it would arrive quickly and on the expected date. I was extremely pleased when it arrived on Sunday morning. The packaging it came in, was a big brown box that contained a smaller OEM box. Here, the drive was safely padded against external vibrations. I had it up and running by noon that same day.This is the caddy I used for turning my Blue-ray tray into a third hard drive bay:\nSATA Hard Drive Tray,Universal 12.7mm SATA to SATA 2nd SSD HDD Hard Drive Caddy Adapter Tray Enclosures for DELL HP LENOVO ThinkPad ACER Gateway ASUS SONY SAMSUNG MSI Laptop By Best shop 2016"", ""Did what's needed. No complaints"", 'Works well and fits easily into a computer case.', 'I love this product!', ""WD Black laptop disks from around the ~2015 era are reliable. I use laptop drives for backing up. AFAIK they seem to last ''forever''(?)Performance is not much more impressive compared to other drives of the era, but it is faster than WD Blue.There is no warranty beyond Amazon's return policy & whatever the seller provides. The Mfg warranty is  expired.IMPORTANT: I recommend that for most things (especially games) you should just get an SSD & not bother with mechanical HDDs (SSDs are much faster), unless price-per-byte or longevity beyond ~2years are what matters.I like the small size of laptop disks. They are small enough to fit a few of them in an old floppy disk case. I primarily buy 500gb disks because they are big enough to be useful & still have a pretty good price per byte.(the other more conventional way to back things up is to get a giant NAS server with the biggest disks you can find. This is the opposite of buying old used laptop disks for backups)I buy used 500gb disks when they are below $15 delivered. Be suspicious of disks sold as NOS. They may be used.As soon as you receive the disk, open the disk in a hex/disk editor (Winhex, for example) to check to see if the disk is actually blank. If there is something other than 00s on it, then it is used.Check the SMART info. (I use Hard Disk Sentinel to do this, but you could use any). For a disk to be ''very good'' it should have less than 1000hrs use & no bad sectors.Do the quick self-test.Whether new or used, put it through a ''reinitialize'' (aka drive regeneration/low level format) to check for any problems & to fix & ''renew''/''refurbish'' the disk. Then do the extended self-test.Initialize/partition/format/install&setup/etcEvery year or 2, ''renew'' the disk using the read/write/read drive renewal process.""]"

So, like a lot of other people, I ordered a replacement drive.**IMPORTANT**  If your disc is reading error, you may not have to swap your PCB board!  For my drive, it wouldn't read discs because the bearing in my disc motor was shot and the entire disc would vibrate.  When this happened, the laser couldn't read anything because of the shaking.  Check to see if yours does the same thing by looking at it when it's spinning.  Look up the videos for how to do this properly so you don't damage anything or injure yourself.  You can also wiggle the motor back and forth and if there is some play in it, then the bearing is shot.  If so, then it's a quick fix.  This motor in the drive has just 3 screws and a ribbon cable holding it in.  Just swap your old one out with the new one from the new drive and that should solve all problems.I wanted to go further though, and have my disc tray work properly.  So, I proceeded to do the full PCB swap.I initially swapped my old PCB board to the new drive, as instructed, but the new laser would never continue reading any discs.  It would light up, do its regular movement when a disc is loaded in, but then it would stop and wouldn't continue to try and read.  I even tried adjusting the laser resistance on the left POT within the appropriate parameters, but it still refused to read.  I suspected that the laser module may not have wanted to receive full instructions from my old PCB board, so I ended up just putting my old laser and frame into the new drive as well.  The items from the new drive that were kept were the disc tray and mechanism(which my old one was faulty), and the new disc motor(which my old one had a bad bearing which caused all of my original disc errors).I reassembled everything and now my Xbox 360 reads my discs perfectly.  This may have just been a rare case for this to happen with my PCB board, but I'm glad I was able to use the other components to fix the original issues.

The two methods are swapping PCBs, or flashing the new drive.  Well, the text for flashing isn\'t even a hyperlink, so I clicked on PCB swap....it basically said it should be done by someone with lots of experience, a static mat, and anti-ESD wrist strap...and nothing else.  Turns out that\'s a good thing... after watching a YouTube video on how to do the PCB swap, a second video came up, wherein a guy suggested just swapping the laser mechanism... this involves two screws to move the PCB out of the way, 4 screws to remove the laser mechanism, and detaching 3 ribbon cables... whereas the PCB swap involves the 2 PCB screws, 3 ribbon cables, plus de-soldering and re-soldering 6 small wires.  Made a lot more sense to me to just swap over the laser mechanism.

Incidentally, if you haven\'t taken your 360 apart to try cleaning the laser, adjusting the pots, etc., or if you did but put it back together and it still didn\'t work, and you didn\'t take note of which make/model DVD drive you have, there are also videos on YouTube that tell you how to identify what kind of drive you have by removing only the front cover, which pops off quite easily from the bottom.', ""Bought this Drive from Nextec as it was available with Prime shipping.Xbox wouldn't open anymore or read disc.

I have a lot of music, videos, and pictures so I wanted a fast, large-capacity HD to store it all without having to lug around an external HD and also leave me plenty of room for future growth.  I've always been drawn to the IBM/Hitachi Travelstar line because of their good reliability record and first-class build quality so naturally, this is the first place I look when I'm shopping for a new laptop HD.  Originally, I had my mind set on the Travelstar 5K1000 but when I learned there was a 7200-RPM version of that drive, the 7K1000, I decided to go with this model due to the better performance, especially since the price difference between the 5K1000 vs. the 7K1000 was only a few dollars.As of this review (1/8/13), the 7K1000 is the fastest, largest-capacity laptop HD money can buy.  Best of all, it comes in a standard 9.5mm high package, meaning it should fit in the drive bays of most regular laptops (many high-capacity laptop HDs come in thicker 12.5mm high packages that don't fit in today's slimline laptops).  I should warn you, however, that it might not fit into ultrabooks, which usually accept only thinner 7mm high drives.  Being a high-performance 7200-RPM drive, I expected the 7K1000 to be a little noisier and hotter than a slower 5400-RPM equivalent but to my delight, I found the drive to be very quiet, hardly any louder than the 5400-RPM Travelstar 5K500.B I have in my other ThinkPad.  Short of putting my ear directly over the laptop's HD bay, the 7K1000's seeking noises are virtually inaudible.  It also runs pretty cool for a 7200-RPM drive, hovering around 30*C even after copying my ~60GB music collection onto it.  I also looked at the power-consumption specs for both the 5K1000 and 7K1000 and the difference is only a small fraction of a watt, meaning a minimal hit to battery life (which could probably be offset just by making the screen one notch dimmer).  The jury is still out on long-term reliability as my 7K1000 only has 8 hours of use on it but so far, so good.  I've had good luck with the 5K500.B I bought back in 2009 and I'm hoping this one will serve me just as well.UPDATE 2/14/13There seems to be some confusion about this drive, as I have since discovered that there appear to be two different versions of this drive, one with a 16MB cache and the other with a 32MB cache.  However, I have reason to suspect that the 16MB-cache version is actually a 32MB unit in an incorrectly-labeled box.  Having noticed this discrepancy, I e-mailed HGST directly about this issue and gave them the exact model and serial number of my specific drive (which came in a box that indicated the drive had a 16MB cache) and they informed me that my drive actually has a 32MB cache.  I then brought up the technical-specification page on the HGST website ([...]) and confirmed that the model number of my drive (HTS721010A9E630) matched the model number on the HGST site, which indicates this drive indeed has a 32MB cache.  I suspect initial shipments of this drive may have been packaged in old boxes left over from the previous-model drive and thus show incorrect specifications.  This is only my own personal speculation and I may be wrong, but hopefully my findings should help clarify some of the confusion.As long as I'm updating this review, I might as well give a reliability update on my 7K1000.  My drive now has ~70 hours on the clock and no issues yet, aside from a slowly-increasing Ultra ATA CRC Error Count, which I suspect may be due to a weird fluke in the T420's BIOS rather than a problem with the drive itself as it predictably goes up 1-2 points each time I start the computer and does not increase further (even after copying ~100GB of files) until the next boot.  Other than that, my 7K1000 seems to be working perfectly."", 'Update August 2016: Checking the failed Travelstar against the HGST website, I found it was still in warranty. I filed for replacement right at the site, returned the failed disk at HGST\'s expense, and received a cross-shipped new drive within days. Superb service, and as I stated earlier, the failure may have been just a fluke, or my aging Lenovo not cooling properly, the other Travelstar is doing fine, and the replacement passed all the tests I threw at it with flying colours.Update July 2016: recently, I had heard some occasional chirps from the Lenovo laptop this drive lives in, running 24/7/365, and because I was thinking about replacing the laptop anyway, I decided to get another drive in order to copy the load of this drive so it would be easier to switch over. I found a larger drive, the 2TB\xa0\nSamsung Seagate Spinpoint M9T 2TB 2.5-Inch SATA 6Gb/s 32MB Cache  Internal Hard Drive(ST2000LM003)\n, and as I began to back up the data on the original drive, got some read errors. Turns out the Travelstar was developing bad sectors, I did manage to copy the (600GB) load off the drive, and bring the new drive on line, but I am having to do a full recovery on the Travelstar, as it reports it has run out of backup clusters, something that is going to take days. As I bought this in late 2013, I have to tell you this drive isn\'t up to par - that certainly may be a fluke (I have another, so I should be able to tell you..), but I\'ve not had drive error messages from the Lenovo or from Windows, and I was, from the diagnostics, about to lose data (if I have not already) and the first signal I got was an error backing up, which I do every day or so. Considering the size of the drive, this turns out to be a high risk device - a drive that completely runs out of spare clusters (all hard disks come with spare clusters so bad clusters can be mapped to good ones, that in itself is not unusual) in less than three years has a higher than expected failure rate.Update 1/8/2014: While the drive works fine, is noiseless and blisteringly fast, ""moving over"" gave me a couple of problems that I was too impatient to really solve. While there are newer base formats available for the E-SATA interface under Windows 8, I opted to clone the old drive to the new drive. Even though the software reported success, I was then unable to boot from the new drive. I have not tested further, but assume this is due to HGST\'s ""Advanced Format"", which has quadrupled the drive\'s sector size, relying on emulation to handle the drive interface with traditional formats, and that may have fooled the cloner completely. So I ended up completely re-installing Windows 8 (thank heavens I had an email backup so I could retrieve the Windows 8 Upgrade serial number, since Windows 8 and beyond have the serial number hardcoded in the installation media), then booting AIS Backup under Linux and restoring the C: partition. That all worked fine, no errors, no issues. Next, the Windows drive interface turned on Windows\' write-cache buffer, something that slows down your drive access (you find this under drive properties/policies - Windows natively comes up with caching disabled, even though this is unnecessary on laptops). I wasn\'t able to turn that back off until after I found and installed an Intel AHCI driver supplied by Lenovo support. This may be peculiar to my series of Lenovo laptops, but it is a good idea to check. I have a sneaking suspicion that after restoring the old drive configuration, it\'ll only run at 3 GB/s, instead of the 6 GB/s it is capable of. None of the above are necessary to get the drive to work, though. Zoom zoom :)Original Review, 12/15/2013: While I am installing the HGST Travelstar (Hitachi sold this unit to Western Digital) terabyte drive with its 7200rpm and 32MB solid state cache to gain Windows speed - you gain more speed with a larger faster drive than with a faster processor - it does not make sense to let much of that big disk sit unused. Today, I have a 500GB disk in the laptop, and I am only using about 100GB of that. So, if I am going to take my active backup, some 400GB of it, and migrate that back to the main disk in my laptop, I am going to have to see how I am going to back that up, and run maintenance tasks on it. And then, I should migrate back from two full backups to just one full backup. Cloning to the disk turned out to be a pain, I ended up re-installing Windows 8, then restoring my Windows 8.1 C: drive load to the new drive using AIS Backup, and that worked, but elegant it is not. Windows 8/8.1 have copy protections that really make it hard to just clone-and-install, if you\'re going from one disk size to another. If I find an easier way I\'ll update this posting.Having said that, here are Windows 8.1\'s specs - same OS and version, same 8GB memory, same laptop:\xa0\nLenovo G570 4334DBU 15.6-Inch Laptop (Black)\n:Old disk: 2.5 inch 7mm 5600rpm 500GBDiskScore 5.8AvgThroughput units=""MB/s"" score=""5.8"" ioSize=""65536"" kind=""Sequential Read"" 63.80625AvgThroughput units=""MB/s"" score=""3.3"" ioSize=""16384"" kind=""Random Read"" 1.16000New disk: 2.5 inch 9.5mm 7200rpm 1TBDiskScore 5.9AvgThroughput units=""MB/s"" score=""6.6"" ioSize=""65536"" kind=""Sequential Read"" 102.13750AvgThroughput units=""MB/s"" score=""3.9"" ioSize=""16384"" kind=""Random Read"" 1.44000No, that laptop is not officially Windows 8 compatible, and if you don\'t know how to bamboozle Lenovo\'s firmware and Microsoft\'s software, better not try, you could jeopardize your data.While I have only been running with this disk for a couple of days, it is quieter than the 500GB that was there before, I could occasionally hear armature movement with that, though never excessive, and even though this drive consumes 100 more mW than the old one, the cooling system exhaust temperature is about 10° Fahrenheit lower than with the 500GB installed. This makes perfect engineering sense, feel free to email me if you need to down-and-dirty, suffice it to say here that this drive runs more efficiently, so your laptop may last longer and stress less, especially if you use it in warmer climates.  I should add that the drive is so much faster that software load times are noticeably better. Windows happy, me happy, good show.', ""I have 3 of these for my laptop which I clone regularly and store.  Its the best solution to the backup problem.  Since I started this, I have not actually had to use a backup drive, but if that day comes (again), with a screwdriver I'll have an exact copy of my hard drive from the last clone.  This is about 100 times faster than using backup software.As for the new programs and data that appear in the interim, I use an online backup service.  That way I can sync up or simply retrieve my data from the internet, but I only need what's happened in the last month or so.  The drives have survived lots of travel, the usual bumps, drops, and all the radiation that airport security can dose them with.  The 7200 RPM is a huge step up from a 5200 RPM Drive and you will notice the performance difference.  It's not like an SSD, but the cost/performance of these drives is better as far as I'm concerned, and at Amazon's price you can own several and solve the backup problem using cloning.  On my system I use the eSata port with a cable that powers the drive and interfaces to it.  If you don't have eSata you can do the same thing with USB but USB 2.0 is a bit slower.  On eSata the drive will clone in less than 2 hours.  On USB 2.0 it will take longer, but will finish before morning.If you use Windows you must be careful when cloning your system drive - you can't just leave it connected after you clone it because Windows will detect a duplicate copy and think you are trying to do something other than simply protect your system and data.  After the clone just disconnect the drive before you reboot and put it back in the box, and its all good.If you have a laptop, a few of these drives will give you piece of mind, performance, and lots of storage.  They are also inexpensive enough to allow you to try out other operating systems like Linux.  If you don't have much data, this drive is big enough to hold Windows and several virtual copies of Linux - or to dual boot.  If you want to keep Windows as your host operating system, you can run Virtual Box and run linux as a virtual machine, but in actual fact your system will be far faster if you do exactly the reverse - make your host system Linux and run Wndows in a virtual window.  The reason is related to disk usage.  Windows is not a very good time sharing platform even simply running it's own native applications (everyone who runs acrobat and MS OFFICE has seen this) but Linux fixes those issues, keeping your system responsive even under heavy load.  Again, all of this is made possible by having inexpensive, reliable hard drives and HGST/Amazon deliver."", 'This drive works great and is so fast.

I also maintain an out of computer backup but it\'s so nice to be able to see new life for an old computer.  One caution though.  IF you attempt and try this yourself then make sure the drive is reformatted and erased and uses the Mac Journalized format before attempting to Clone data.  Then copy the OS onto the drive that you have purchased and are authorized to use.  One GREAT thing about Apple is when you upgrade OS they allow you to use it on up to 5 machines you own (provided it\'s upgraded through the Apple App Store).The caution and suggestion is using the new Internal Hard Drive connected through an adapter SATA cable to a USB slot on the computer (Patuoxun USB 2.0 to Sata Converter Adapter Cable w/ 2.5"" 2.5 Inch Hard Drive) then Shut down the computer you plan to insert the drive into and do an OPTION Boot.

Choose your newly cloned HGST Travelstar drive to boot from (even though it\'s now an internal drive being used as an external drive through your USB port(s), and see if the computer will boot into the drive and with the drive before you actually go through the trouble of inserting it into your computer\'s frame and that way you know for sure before you go to the trouble of taking the computer apart then risking having to do it all over again.I like this drive it actually makes my MacBook Pro 15.4"" seem faster than it did before and equally fast as my MacBook Pro 17"".I read many who said that Western Digital drives do not work as substitution and replacement drives in MacBook Pros but in my MacBook Pro3,1 15.4"" model it worked flawlessly.  I replaced a 160GB drive with this 1 TB drive and everything works great.', 'Knowing how quickly the stock hard drive could be filled up with game downloads, I figured I\'d make the jump to this 1 TB drive sooner rather than later.  I was drawn to the faster RPM (the stock hard drive being 5400) as well. The drives are made by the same company.I went through the process of downloading the needed game save info to a memory stick, then used another one for the PS4\'s system install itself.  Removing the old drive is as easy as it gets and the new one is a little shorter in height but it fits properly.Within 15-20 minutes I had the system reinstalled, game saves copied over, and I was on the way to downloading my existing games again. I\'ve already noticed better speeds in installing games, plus you save a few seconds when starting games.FYI: in case you\'re wondering about game codes, I was able to use the same ones I had already input on the original drive/system. I\'m sure it\'s tied into your PSN account.One thing to be aware of is there are around 860 GB of actual available space on the drive you can fill up (it\'s actually fluctuating between 860-862 at the moment), which probably factors in the system install along with the usual amount of data that\'s not actually ""free."" Keep this in mind, the stock drive I had showed 408 GB available out of the 500 overall so in the end you\'re getting roughly 86% of the capacity of the 1 TB drive compared to about 81.6% of the 500 GB original.At this point I am absolutely satisfied with this drive as a replacement upgrade for the original PS4 one and will have much more flexibility when it comes to data kept on the system along with the ease of knowing I can always reinstall some things at a later date if I have to and do it a bit faster.As I write this the price is also $74.95, even better than the $87.20 I paid a month ago. If you\'re on the fence about adding more space to your PS4, you could do much, much worse than this.', ""I bought one of these a little over a week ago as an upgrade for my PS3 Super Slim.  It fits in the hard drive caddy and installed with no problems.The drive formatted to an available space of 928gb before installing the firmware or restoring my installed games and media, providing exactly four times the 232gb of available space on the 250gb hard drive that came with the system.  The extra space really comes in handy if you have PS Plus and download a lot of free and discounted games.I haven't noticed any increase in noise or heat production, but my PS3 is on a shelf under the TV about eight feet away, so any differences wouldn't be noticeable.Games that stream off of the Blu-Ray disc, such as The Last of US, are unaffected by hard drive performance.  Those that install largely or completely to the hard drive (Heavenly Sword, Arkham Origins) and digital downloads that exist entirely on the HD (Tomb Raider, Grid 2) seem to start up and load new areas and movies more quickly, but this isn't a huge difference due to the limitations of the PS3's SATA controller, which is SATA 1.5, and thus unable to fully exploit the higher data rate transfer this drive is capable of.I did notice that downloaded games install noticeably faster.  Installs from discs are unaffected, as the limiting factor there is the slow Blu-Ray drive.I bought a hard drive enclosure along with this drive to put the 250gb hard drive I took out of the PS3 into, effectively getting an external USB 250gb hard drive for the cost of an enclosure after reformatting the drive from Sony's FAT32 system into the NTFS system used by Windows.I can't attest to long term durability due to having had the drive for only a week, but so far it's performing as expected and I now have space for more of those PS Plus free games.This is a very good combination of capacity and performance for a 9.5mm drive for a PS3 or PS4, though the PS3's hardware can't fully take advantage of the performance capability."", ""Pros: Works with PS3. 7200 RPM and big cache. 3 Year warranty. Passed bad sector check. Good price.Cons: None.Other thoughts:I got this because I needed a bigger HDD for my PS3. The max size usable with the PS3 is supposedly 1 TB. It worked fine for this. I imagine it would work with a PS4 too, but I don't have one to try it out.I have to commend Sony for making the drive so easy to replace. The biggest hassle was moving the stuff from one of my external HDDs so I could reformat it to FAT32. The backup of the PS3 took quite a while too; The data files were heavily compressed. The only problem I ran into was an error that said the backup operation could not be completed—it went away when I restarted the PS3 with the external drive already attached and powered as opposed to hooking it up when the PS3 was already running.The drive passed the Western Digital Lifeguard extended test. I started using the HGST drive tool, but it was quite bare-bones and didn't even have a “Time Remaining” on the test window, which bugged me, so I switched to the WD software. HGST is a division WDC now, but whether they would accept the results of the WD software test is anyone's guess. Something tells me they would give you a hard time about and make you re-run the scan using the HGST software. The warranty is 3 years. I have RMA-ed several WD drives without any problem. I don't know if HGST would be as easy despite being part of WD. Again, anyone's guess. Hopefully I don't need to find out.As far as performance, I'm not really sure. I didn't benchmark it when it was attached to my PC. All I can say is it doesn't seem any slower than the drive which came with the PS3, a Toshiba 320GB, I assume 5200RPM.All in all, I would recommend this drive if you need a bigger drive for your Playstation.. It's specs are better than comparably priced WD drives, and it has a better warranty."", ""I installed this hard drive in place of the original Toshiba 5400 RPM SATA 3GB/s drive that was installed on my Early 2011 MacBook Pro; and I have had excellent results to date. The response time of this computer with the HGTS Travelstar installed is noticeably faster with disk-intensive applications such as Photoshop image rendering and in video editing than was the case with the original drive. I have had no reason to measure any effect that this hard drive replacement may have on battery charge drain, so I cannot comment on that issue.The easiest way I have found to replace a hard drive in an Intel Mac laptop which supports it is to install the replacement drive into one of the inexpensive 2.5 inch external drive enclosures available from Amazon. Connect this assembly to a Mac via a USB or Firewire cable, whichever is applicable. Next, format the new disk (and partition it, if desired) using the Mac disk utility. If the installed drive in the laptop is functioning, this work can be accomplished on the laptop by connecting the new drive in the external enclosure to it; otherwise another operating Mac is required. After the new disk is formatted, the files and Operating System from the old drive (if it is functioning) can be cloned to the new disk. Alternatively, install the desired Mac OS from a DVD or downloaded installer onto the new disk drive and transfer any desired files to the new drive as well. Next, I recommend rebuilding the new disk's directory and defragmenting the disk to squeeze the last possible bit of performance out of the device, although these refinements are probably not absolutely necessary.After the replacement disk is prepared according to the above directions the new drive can be installed into the laptop chassis by a person with the proper tools and knowledge to perform the task. Alternatively, the job can be accomplished by anyone capable of carefully following the Do-It-Yourself instructions available online from sources such as iFixit.com or Other World Computing. The proper tools for performing this task are available from these two sources and from other places online."", ""Despite the horror stories of how poorly these drives appear to be manufactured, I guess I got off lucky with mine. It was cheap, effective storage for the price, except you get less than what you bought. This is always the case with hard disks, and if you are expecting a full terabyte of storage, and worked out a floor plan for how those partitions would fit in a terabyte's worth of space, you'll be sorely disappointed -- Go with a 1.1 TB drive instead so you're sure to be a little bit over what you need.The performance may be lacking for some, but if you keep very good care of your system, then you won't notice anything worse than what your OEM gave when you first received your machine, provided it's a disk drive.Some tips to boost performance and prevent data loss through all means:- Don't install more than you need to do what you want- Starting fresh is always better, so re-install your OS or upgrade whenever specifications allow it- Keep your disk drive defragmented, always -- There's even software that resolves data fragmentation on-the-fly.- Use a good, light antivirus or anti-malware suite with antivirus built-in- Always run your browser through a sandbox, either that you antimalware suite provides or through a dedicated sandboxing software (Not a virtual machine -- There is a difference)- Invest some time in software to control your browsing environment and lock down your browser. Anything that NoScript supports is a good start.- Most of all, have a storage plan. Since this is your drive, you have the power to map out partitions within certain limits; Four base partitions, with the capacity to add more through extended partitions. Helps to know your way around a Linux distro and anything using parted as a backend, like GParted or KParted (depending on desktop environment, may be different from those mentioned)."", 'Nothing to say except that this little internal hard drive works like a champ. No surprises, and the swap was flawless.I replaced the original 500GB hard drive in a mid-2009 17-inch MacBook Pro with this little jewel for two reasons: 1) The original hard drive started making a periodic clicking sound, which means imminent hard drive failure; and 2) after Apple\'s Disk Utility verified that my original hard drive had errors of all sorts, I proceeded to ""Repair Disk."" It could not complete the repair process. My only option was to replace the hard drive.I used a USB- (connected to computer\'s USB 2.0 port) to-SATA (connected to HGST Travelstar) powered cable (which uses an adapter that plugs into a wall outlet) to create a ghost clone of my old hard drive (using software called ""SuperDuper""). I then opened up the MacBook Pro, removed the hard drive, and installed this one in its place. After putting the bottom plate back on the laptop, I started up the Mac, and it booted up flawlessly.My original hard drive had a 16MB cache...this one has a 32MB cache. The speed difference is noticeable.Pros: Quiet, fast, and I doubled my hard drive storage...for only $74 (at time of purchase).Cons: Not a thing; however, since it took nearly 5 hours to complete the clone, it would have been nice to use a Firewire 800 to SATA cable instead of the much slower USB 2.0 to SATA cable. I could not find such a cable though.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!  In fact, after replacing my hard drive, and loving the ease at the whole process, I checked my wife\'s hard drive with Apple\'s Disk Utility, and hers was worse than my original hard drive. So I bought another one and replaced hers too. Same results: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!']"

Amazon needs to crack down on vendors who sell used goods as new.', 'The reason for my 3 stars on longevity is because I\'ve only recently installed this drive in the last few weeks, so I haven\'t been able to judge its longevity.  But, can I say WOW!?  We have a backup archive located on an older XP machine with fairly recent motherboard, which can handle SATA II.  This hard drive is installed in that machine.  I\'m using Acronis 11.7 to push backups from various mission-critical computers to this Hitachi hard drive.  Here are my observations.  First I had a Western Digital Green drive in the place where this new drive is now installed in the hard drive cage.  That ""green"" drive always was a bit slow on backups, anywhere between an hour to 3 hours for a single image to be copied.  So I had to spread out my backup schedule so as to not overload the XP computer\'s max of 10 connections (user sessions).  One Acronis backup takes three user sessions in XP, so you can only run three backups at a time (and even that is risky).  As you can imagine, to backup the images for 10 mission-critical computers  would take days, not just hours.  As the green drive aged over the past few years, the backup times got slower and slower, almost as if it was getting too full, even though I managed the space enough to have at least 30% drive space available, even with all backups on board.  The aging of the drive sent the backup times into orbit, with 6 to 10 hours needed for just one backup.  After about four years from new install until now, the green drives eventually died.  I started doing research on what guys were recommending for a good, reliable drive these days, and other than Samsung (with expensive price tag to boot), I saw Hitachi is making some noise with certain lines of their drives in the realm of longevity, efficiency and reliability.  Enter this Hitachi drive into my backup schema.  WOW, WOW, WOW, images are now only taking a MAX of 34 minutes to perform!  Some backups of the C drive image are now transferred in less than 20 minutes!  This is across a gigabit network on a SATA II serial drive controller running XP!  I\'m impressed!  So the green drive wasn\'t a good choice at all, even from the beginning.  I knew they suffered on performance a little bit, but I never realized by how much.  We\'re trying to stay economical here, so please don\'t rag me about XP or using cheap drives, etc.  I can\'t complain too badly, the XP machine has been a breeze to manage, with no security issues at all and the green drive did last about 6 years with 24/7 operation.  This little backup rack mounted computer has been reliable as sin.  But, the Hitachi blows the old performance away, even with the same motherboard, NIC and SATA controller.  I can only imagine what the time saved would be if the PC had a SATA III controller.  In any case, I can now run much faster and more frequent backups instead on settling for one-a-week like I did with the old drive.  If this drive lasts for 5 to 10 years, it\'ll be worth every penny.  I installed the ""green"" drive back in 2015, I hope to get slightly longer time out of the Hitachi.  MTBF is really no good indicator of real-life longevity for any hard drive, but I think I can rely on the word of lots of professionals who have had good luck recently with Hitachi.  So here I am giving it my first whirl in a long time.  I do have some old Hitachi EIDE drives, which I believe to this day would probably spin up and perform just fine.  Though drives are not made that way anymore, I think Hitachi has proven they know what they are doing when it comes to hard drive manufacturing.  (update)  6 months later in January 2020, the drive is still going strong and fast.  Backups have not failed once in the last six months, which is a record for this PC.  This drive continues to perform very well in our Windows XP backup computer.  This computer is dedicated to just doing nothing but making copies of backups to the onboard drives.  The computer is a rack mount unit and contains two of these Hitachi drives.  We use Acronis to perform the backups.  I can\'t begin to tell you how awful slow it was to back up with Acronis on the old WD Green drives.  I\'d have to space the backups at least 12 hours apart, and even then, the backups weren\'t reliable.  With the Hitachi drives installed, the backups only take about 20 to 35 minutes to image the C: drive from the host computer across a gigabit network.  Very impressive.  And we have not missed ONE SINGLE BACKUP since I installed these drives last summer.  Which is a historical event for me.  Other drives, whether they were WD or Seagate, always had reliability issues.  I had always thought it was an Acronis or a Windows issue, but now I know it\'s not true.  It\'s just lousy HDDs.  I feel for the people who have bought these drives and have had duds with them, and that can happen with any platter HDD today, please give them another shot.  I had a bad one of these Hitachi drives, too, it lasted a couple of weeks and died, but the Amazon vendor promptly replaced it.  The drives have been great.  Now comes the long haul, but I thought I would at least update you on the last 6 months with these Hitachi drives, I can\'t praise them enough for a spindle drive.  So far, so good!)  28APR20-Update: Something to keep in mind when doing image backups of your C drives in Windows, make sure you have cleaned up your shadow storage in Windows, cleaned out the temp files in the System 32 directory and set your Windows Backup and Recovery options for as small as you dare.  This greatly affects how much storage is used by your image.  Your image is going to include all the junk space as well as the obvious usage that Windows reports in the explorer window.  So be certain you have this all cleaned up and under control, else you could wind up using your HDD space for backups a lot sooner than you think.  I discovered this after having abnormally large hard drive usage in Win7, after I cleaned up the shadow storage through a DOS command line, I was able to shorten the Windows backup and recovery space and re-run my Acronis backups with considerable relief of the backup space used (about 50%), so it\'s vitally important to conserve your remote backup space with these methods.  Now I can use more of the space on these Hitachi drives for more backups for other computers!  The drives are still going strong with fast, reliable backups, not a single backup job with Acronis has failed since I installed them in the summer of 2019.', 'I purchased other Hitachi products before, but the build of this one that I received seemed less sturdy than I had anticipated for this type of drive. Ended up returning it and opting for another drive that was more well-reviewed and higher-rated.', ""Because I've been using the Ultrastar for only a month, I can't, in honesty, give it 5-stars until I know how long it lasts, but I see no reason why it won't last as long as any other 2TB HDD.

In any case, Hitachi drives have a good reputation."", ""prior to purchasing this, i was informed about studies done on internal harddrives used by many companies and through that, hitachi seems to be the gold standard for longevity or how long the drives lifespan is. many reviews though who have purchased from this line seem to have received old, used drives or completely be dead on arrival.i am very pleased with the drive and the seller. i'm also glad that despite a few 1 star ratings here and there, it did not dissuade me from making a purchase. the package came in excessive bubble wrap, that made the main package bulky. inside was another box with another layer of bubble wrap around the drive itself, and then the non-static packaging. i don't see how any of the drives delivered or shipped this way could be used or old, my drive seemed brand new.on the drive itself- i don't see why reviewers state it's loud and excessive. it's dead silent....does not make any noise or sound, and seems to run very cool.- the drive itself i believe winds itself down when not in use so in essence it isn't being read by the computer 24/7 which i believe contributes to it's lifespan. but when you do attempt to access it, it does take a few seconds to load back up, which is logical.- the drive copies very quickly, i can't see for a need to have greater speeds than this. this is probably the most affordable / quality drive in the market.- the drive uses about 19 gigs out of it's 2tb availability."", ""Prodotto nuovo, sia nell'aspetto, sia nei dati rilevati via SMART.

I got 145mb/s read & write, so that was amazing. Overall the hard drive works like it suppose to, but it does make a lot of noise. I was concerned about this issue, so i run Western Digital extensive Hard Drive test to make sure the drive was working ok and after running the test for 8hrs it didn't find any problem. I've also checked for bad sectors and again didn't find anything. I know some of the drives does tend to make these type of noises such as some of the older Seagate Drives.

Hitachi beat out WD as the most reliable drive by a small but significant margin. Hitachi is also fast, though I don\'t have figures.

I bought and installed four of these 2TB units in a single RAID 10 configuration, last month, through Amazon.  The drives run 24/7 and are constantly accessed by me and a file synch program. For my money they\'re as silent as any others I have used in Mac or PC installations, barely audible 2\' away on my work desk. This RAID is really fast. I read the comments about head repositioning noise. It is a slightly noticeable curiosity I would\'t have identified without these reviews.

But perfectly fine for a large Steam library, music library, video library, etc.Other thoughts: If using on a desktop computer with Windows, please look up ""Symbolic Links"" and ""Directory Junctions"". It\'ll make installing games easy, since it\'ll redirect ""C:\\Steam"" to ""D:\\Steam"" (example), so you\'ll never have to modify the installation directory again (nor worry about registry problems). You can also do the same for certain programs (like game mod management tools), music and video libraries, etc. Symbolic links mean you can have folders that open in different devices (like hard drives or SSDs), but that all appear to have the same directory (""C:\\Steam"" for example) even though the files are located on the hard drive. This makes keeping your OS on an SSD and your game libraries on an HDD much simpler and better. It\'ll save you time, be more convenient, and you won\'t have to move files around or tinker about with the registry (nor reinstall or repair existing installations of games or other programs).', 'Product Comments:Product itself is high quality, sequential write for empty disk tops out at 150+MB/s at the outside down to about 115MB/s at the inside of the spindles.

Checking the serial at HGST yields a response to contact the vendor, ie. no manufacturer warranty.Both drives I received had previous SMART self tests at 8000-9000 hours, yet drive reports 0 hours of service. All other SMART data was clear leading me to wonder these drives have been previously used and cleared by TTL command.Single drives from seller come in small USPS Priority Mail box with double layer of bubble wrap and sealed anti-static bag, this is a bit sparse on padding.

It means, in real terms, that the drive works much harder, and clicks and clunks noisily in regular, real-world use, which has the drive parking and unparking crazy amounts of times in a very short duration of use. The manufacturer actually points to lower standards of build quality for their cheaper green drives, versus the reds, black, etc, so this increased wear is of particular concern. They give the figure of lifetime parks as 300,000 (like after this number you may expect drive death), which is the ""Load_Cycle_Count"", which (at least for these drives) is SMART attribute ID ""193"", and some people are reporting seeing millions in this counter after only a few years, so it is a risk to the longevity of the drive.The TLER thing, NOBODY has reported issues with this, as far as I can tell, this is a total mind-warp to sell red drives, which are very much more expensive for seemingly very little actual improvement in the drive itself. Anyways, I am using software base RAID, or none, so this is not a concern for me either way. But if you read what TLER actually is, this \'feature\' is actually the limiting/removal of another \'feature\' of the drives. Seems to me there is zero real-world justification for charging currently an extra +26% for red drives over greens, WD are being vicious by sabotaging their cheap drives with parking/LCC and TLER, I smell marketing sub-genius at work here, they are ruining the reputation of WD amongst the tech-savvy, their largest customers, and the ones with the consumer influence. Stupid move WD, reign in your marketing and management monkies.Also, these drives are 5400RPM or LESS - that is what ""IntelliPower"" means - more marketing BS nonsense! Why not JUST say 5400RPM max? It is rubbish that they are not 7200RPM, and that to get this from WD, you need the ridiculously over priced Black drives. But Seagate are not an option, and Toshiba drives are like gold dust since WD bought them (and CRAZY prices). Yet there\'s no other option for 3TB+ just now it seems. We just want drives that work, like my old faithful Hitachi\'s, full SMART readouts in Linux, 7400RPM, and zero nonsense touted as ""extras"". No eco-babble BS, just drives that work, fast, forever, and cheap, it\'s not rocket science, surely it costs WD more, both in cash and social good-will, to add this stuff no-one wants on to the drives and mess with their customers?The greatest crime in obfuscation for HDDs is of course the SATA 2 or 3 speeds that are quoted as the drive speeds. This is borderline lying, and very misleading. You will get the crazy large speeds they tout as ""drive speeds"" only from the tiny cache on the drive, and how do you populate the cache? From the much slower drive itself, which is where the vast majority of reads come from. So these drives have 64MB of cache, how many files you pull repeatedly this size or less? Criminal stats. No 3Gbps and 6Gbps are lies in the real-world. They are also confusing folks with little \'b\' versus big \'B\' too, bits vs. bytes. Bear in mind, the block size is the smallest amount of data you can *really* pull from the drive, and certainly \'parted\' (partitioning tool) in Linux plus I believe Windows tools too, default to 4k blocks on these large drives. So the minimum you read IRL is 4k. This raises the aside: ""Advanced Format"" drives, another pointlessly misleading marketing term, which simply means ""4k block size"". So bits and bytes, meh. Just know the diff and be aware which they are talking about. For true values, see my posting of them at the end; ""hdparm -T"" is the hyped cached speed, the true speed of the read from the drive platters is the ""hdparm -t"" results, of which I ran several. These results are in big \'B\' for bytes, and a byte is simply 8bits, so times or divide by 8 for conversions (many people use 10 instead of 8, because it\'s easier maths and actually works well for real-world hidden overheads that we can hide with the slight rounding error here).Now long before all this nonsense, I knew, from previous home server build\'s research, that it is more power efficient AND far better for data security / longevity, to never have drives stop, spin down, park, and it\'s the same for the fans, plus the system as a whole. So ""power saving"" features in Windows, Linux, BIOS, firmware, is all BS, lies, and actually counter-productive for machines you use daily for any length of time. And I can attest, after decades trying to get a budget perfect long-term home storage system just right, that having your server always running is key to a long running system. Never let it go cold, everytime it cools off, it may never come back up again. Whilst I mention my experiments, let me tell you also; for a data storage machine (a PC as a glorified NAS) spend little on RAM, CPU, get ASROCK mobos with the storage specs you need for the cheapest you can get (for me, number of concurrently usable SATA heads, and checking Linux Hardware Compatibility Lists (HCLs)), then buy a very large CPU heatsink (like a Scythe) to avoid using a CPU fan (fans issues have been correlated with countless system deaths for me, plus they are loud and draw power), and I buy expensive PSUs. Then run the whole thing in an opened case (side off) laid on it\'s side in a low dust, ventilated area (in my case, its own room, with its brother computers). I have no case fans. Cheap PSUs are a false economy, and I had to learn that the hard way. All PSUs fail, cheap ones not only last a shorter time, they tend to take out other components when they blow. Then you have the drives, I do plenty of research on these because I use Linux software RAID, and in the largest sizes of drives. Although this particular purchase was not a new system build, but a replacement, so this purchase was merely 3TB.A last piece of backstory to all this, in the long bitchy history of these flawed green drives, many have gone to WD and done their thing to fix it. WD has a tool named ""wdidle3.exe"". This supposedly allows one to change the parking setting within the disk firmware. Only an older version is openly available online, there are various conflicting stories of using this, some problems ascribed, one is that it only runs in crappy FreeDOS, so that means faffing about with USB boot drives, then some mentions of drive issues after using it, blah blah blah. Then yet others speak of getting newer versions from WD that work in Linux and Windows. I asked WD support for this tool and got no answer, for weeks, and now I have the drive. I bought the drive because I found ""idle3-tools.sourceforge.net"".So that explains my background to the drive. Now the facts that I wanted when I bought this drive, but that were sadly lacking.**Main points**First, installing idle3-tools, an open-source Linux based tool that aims to replace/replicate WD\'s lesser spotted wdidle3.exe:I am running CentOS, because it is free enterprise grade awesomeness, totally stable and very CLI friendly. But for any Linux system you need to MAKE (compile) the tool, and this requires you have development tools and libraries. Although I have seen RPMs, I am security paranoid and trust good old sourceforge. For CentOS:yum groupinstall ""Development Libraries""yum groupinstall ""Development Tools""Then following the install instructions from the idle3-tools site worked flawlessly, see: idle3-tools.sourceforge.netI just used ""MAKE"" from the extracted tgz folder (cd to it), didn\'t need to ""MAKE INSTALL"", I\'m happy to run it from the folder.Knowing the horror stories, I knew some complained that turning parking off entirely caused performance issues on the drive, so I ran speed tests on the drive, then I checked the default idle3 setting on the drive (straight from the factory), then I used the disable function of idle3-tools, cold booted the system (requirement), and re-checked the drive speeds.All the CLI for this is below, as per manpages I ran hdparm speed tests several times for good values, and it looks like my drive improved, it no longer ever returns the slower speeds, just the best speeds from the earlier tests, of around 100MB/s. I\'m very happy with this. I kept googling ""WD30EZRX idle3-tools"" and before that had no luck with ""WD30EZRX wdidle3.exe"", so now I\'ve wrote both of those, hopefully future home data masters can find this and use these cheap drives with some more confidence.Final word before I roll into the tech output, I\'ve used many drives, personally, professionally, internal, external, ATA, SATA, USB, laptop, PC, pro server... and I conclude from many failures: NEVER use Seagate (ever), and always check for Seagates hiding inside external drives, or being rebranded elsewhere. They are not only glitchy defective drives poorly made, but they fail badly! I\'ve now studied a number of Seagate drives failing, and they have made me good at SMART tools, but they just die, with very little warning. I now have a backup script that features checking for changes in the SMART error log, and these Seagate drives say very little, very close to them going dyfunctional, dropping sectors of reads and potentially corrupting on writes, then in no time at all (not long enough to pull your data off) the heads crash and the drive is dead. I\'ve not even had another brand of drive die before I choose to upscale for drive size reasons, and I have several drives in my personal Seagate graveyard. These observations are mirrored in my professional life too, in decades of IT support. All brands of all drives have some rate of failure, accepted, we are talking not only far greater percentage of failures, but also nasty failures. Most drives from others, if they fail, they go out of the box, DOA, then far less go in the first 6 months, tiny percentage in the first year, but after 6 months, you can rely on other brands very much (knowing EVERYTHING fails), and when they do die, if not DOA, then they die with plenty of SMART errors and warnings, logs filled for days with them. Not Seagate. NEVER EVER BUY SEAGATE EVER EVER EVER.I have a grave concern for the HDD market, Seagate are known useless by many, leaving just WD and they I fear, are showing serious problems in their attitude and firmware, this market needs increased competition, but these two giants keep buying others, and they are both highly flawed companies. I miss Toshiba and Hitachi, and even the simpler WD days, before they felt their power and started abusing their customers with eco-BS, lower RPM, and this rainbox colourscheme nonsense.

Next step ""e2fsck -cc"". Good news, not a single addition to the LCC since running ""idle3ctl -d"" and it\'s had several hours of idle time.', 'Prima le note positive, il drive è ragionevolmente veloce e il rapporto prezzo/GB è molto buono.La questione del mancato riconoscimento dei 3TB che ho visto riportata in altri commenti/recensioni è un problema facilmente risolvibile e dipende solo da come viene inizializzato il disco. Al primo avvio dopo il montaggio il disco va,infatti, inizializzato: se lo inizializzate con il tradizionale sistema MBR (Master Boot Record) verranno create due partizioni (una da 2TB e l\'atra da circa 800GB) perchè l\'MBR è in grado di vedere partizioni di massimo 2TB. Se lo inizializzate, invece, GPT (GUID Partition Table, un sistema di gestione partizioni più recente) potrete creare uan partizione unica da 3TB. Per fare ciò basta andare in pannello di controllo, strumenti di amministarzione, gestione computer, gestione disco. E\' possibile farlo anche in un secondo momento (ATTENZIONE: questa operazione cancella tutto quanto già presente sul disco)Veniamo alle note negative: in primis la rumorosità meccanica, che a quanto leggo sui vari forum contraddistingue tutti gli ultimi HD Western Digital. In seguito vedremo da cosa è causata e perchè desta in me preoccupazioni. Ho letto una recensione qui su Amazon in cui si dice che questo HD è silenziosissimo, ma il mio device, invece, emette quando è in idle dei ritmici e fastidisissimi ""click"" . Sospetto che il modello acquistato dall\'altro utente avesse un firmware meno recente e che non avesse il PWL attivo, ma procediamo con ordine: in un primo momento stavo per avviare la procedura di reso, pensando che fosse danneggiato, ma tutti check effettuati con vari software mi dicevano che il disco era ok. Tutti i valori S.M.A.R.T. sono nella norma e sia il tool di diagnosi della WD (Data Lifeguard Diagnostic) che il più professionale CrystalDiskInfo mi dicono che il disco lavora entro parametri normali. Eppure il rumore che si sente è il tipico ""clack-clack"" che fanno i dischi rigidi quando stanno per rompersi. Noto però che è ritmico e che si sente solo quando il disco è in idle, quindi faccio ulteriori ricerche e scopro che gli ultimi dischi WD (hanno cominciato i Red e i Raptor, ma ora pare che coinvolga tutti i dischi, anche i più economici green) sono dotati di un sistema chiamato PWL (PreEmptive Wear Leveling) che entra in funzione solo quando il disco è in idle e serve ad evitare un consumo disomogeneo del disco. Non è ben chiaro come funzioni e la WD su questo è stata poco chiara, ma pare che il pettine con le testine spazzi continuamente la superficie del disco per consenture un\'usura più omogenea della sua superficie (dal sito WD, alla voce PWL: <The drive arm frequently sweeps across the disk to reduce uneven wear on the drive surface common to audio/video streaming applications>). Il dubbio è che questo sistema stressi la meccanica del braccio con le testine molto di più rispetto a quanto faccia un drive senza PWLInoltre in molti (fortunatamente non è il mio caso) hanno riscontarto su questi dischi un altissimo numero (alcune migliaia al giorno) di LCC (Load Cycle Count), in pratica il numero di volte in cui la testina viene messa a parcheggio. Il sistema è gestito da un\'altra nuova tecnologia WD chiamata Intellipark che mette la testina a riposo dopo 8 secondi di inutilizzo. Pare che il problema affligga soprattutto chi utilizza questi drive con Linux (i forum sono pieni di segnalazioni a riguardo)WD assicura che non ci sono problemi legati alla vita di questi HD, ma il loro support ufficiale è piuttosto assente e laconico e si limita a rispondere alle tante segnalazioni dicendo di provare a cambiare cavo (cosa che comunque anche io ho provato a fare) o di avviare una RMA per la sostituzione del disco (ma se il rumore è ""fisiologico"" la sostituzione non serve a nulla)Fatto sta che WD ha rilasciato un aggiornamento del firmware per i dischi Red per ridurre il fenomeno degli elevati LLC ed è stato poi rilasciato anche un software (non particolarmente semplice da usare) che cosente di cambiare manualmente l\'intervallo di tempo prima che la testina vada a parcheggio. Ho provato quest\'ultimo sistema, ma anche portando il parking time da 8s a 5 min, i ""click"" restano ed hanno sempre con la stessa frequenza (da 1 a 3 click ogni 8 secondi) il che mi fa pensare che il rumore sia legato al PWL piuttosto che al parking delle testineIn conclusione: convivo con questo rumore sperando che il mio orecchio lo ""metabolizzi"" (per ora lo trovo fastidioso soprattutto perchè continua a sembrarmi il rumore di hd che sta per rompersi) e augurandomi che il drive sia effettivamente sano e che tutto questi sistemi nati per preservare la superficie del disco e le testine non finiscano poi per fare invecchiare precocemente la meccanica del disco. Ovviamente sto monitorando il valore di LCC del mio drive quotidianamente per vedere se supera i valori di guardia.Le due stelle sono sia per l\'incertezza sull\'affidabilità di questo prodotto che per la scarsa chiarezza da parte di WD a riguardo, oltre che per lo scarso supporto che sta dando ai tanti utenti che stanno segnalando problemi su questi dischi (spero di non dover essere presto anche io uno di questi...)E poi c\'è ovviamente quel continuo ticchettio che piacevole non è...AGGIORNAMENTO: Dopo quasi 7 mesi e circa 1000h di funzionamento il drive continua a lavorare con valori S.M.A.R.T. che rientrano nella norma. La rumorosità dovuta al PWL permane. Come detto il clicking è presente sempre e solo in idle, quindi se lo monterete come drive primario il rumore sarà quasi del tutto assente (il drive è silenzioso durante le fasi di lettura/scrittura), se invece lo userete come drive secondario (ad esempio per lo stoccaggio di grandi quantità di dati a cui accedete di rado) sentirete il clicking di continuo (ogni 8s) perchè il disco starà quasi sempre in idle. Ho portato, però, la mia valutazione da 2 a 3 stelle perché il drive funziona correttamente. Da qui ad un anno di vita, se i valori resteranno buoni, porterò le stelle a 4. Permangono i miei dubbi sulla vita media di questi dispositivi (e temo che saranno i consumers a fare da tester...). La tecnologia PWL, nata per allungare la vita dei drive, potrebbe accorciargliela stressandone eccessivamente la meccanica. Il ""problema"" del clicking e dell\'alto numero di LLC (le virgolette sono d\'obbligo perché western digital precisa che non si tratta di un malfunzionamento) è ben noto sia agli utenti (basta cercare ""wd green pwl"" o ""western digital hard drive clicking sound"" o simili e leggere quanto presente sui forum tecnici) che alla WD che c\'ha tenuto a rassicurare gli acquirenti dichiarando che i suoi drive sono certificati per poter fare più di 1.000.000 LLC senza problemi. Alcuni utenti riportano, inoltre, che WD, a seguito dell\'ondata di preoccupazione da parte dei suoi clienti nel vedere così tanti LLC giornalieri, abbia disattivato del tutto il logging degli LLC fra i parametri SMART di alcuni dei suoi ultimi drive.Concludendo: da consigliare.....mmm, non saprei. Il drive ancora non mi convince del tutto.Il rapporto costo/GB resta molto buono, la velocità per un drive di questa categoria è decorosa e le temperature di funzionamento sono ok, ma i dubbi sull\'affidabilità nel lungo periodo e il continuo clicking possono rappresentare un deal breaker per qualcuno. Spero solo che la WD abbia ragione sulla bontà del PWL...Postilla: ho letto in uno dei commenti a 5 stelle (in cui l\'utente, con estremo slancio, promuove senza riserve questo articolo) un riferimento estremamente ostile al mio post (definito addirittura ""insensato"" e pieno di ""generalizzazioni prive di fondamento""). Premettendo che ognuno è libero di esprimere le proprie opinioni (magari con un po\' più di garbo...) e che quindi rispetto anche quelle dell\'utente in questione, puntualizzo due cose.Punto primo: l\'hard disk in mio possesso non è difettoso ne tanto meno è l\'unico a produrre il clicking noise (ripeto, basta fare una ricerca con google...).Punto secondo: oltre ad essere un appassionato di hardware sono anche laureato in Scienze Informatiche e, sebbene l\'elettronica degli HD non sia il mio campo, prima di scrivere qualcosa tendo a documentarmi sull\'argomento...Ritengo che lo scopo di questo spazio sia dare un feedback sull\'articolo acquistato sia sulla base delle proprie esperienze con l\'oggetto in questione che sulla base delle proprie competenze tecniche. Per tal motivo spero che quanto da me scritto possa essere utile a qualcuno che abbia già acquistato o intenda acquistare questo dispositivo e che magari abbia delle difficoltà con la sua formattazione e/o sia preoccupato dal continuo clicking emesso (rumore di cui, comunque, l\'acquirente potrebbe anche non accorgersi).AGGIORNAMENTO (MAGGIO 2015) Il disco continua a funzionare senza problemi e i parametri SMART sono buoni (dopo circa 2000 ore di esercizio e 1300 accensioni). La situazione rumorosità in idle è molto migliorata dopo il passaggio da Windows 7 a Windows 8.1 (stesso profilo di gestione energetica: ""prestazioni elevate""). Suppongo che W8 abbia una migliore gestione energetica dei dischi in idle rispetto a W7 (ed inoltre ho notato il download tramite windows update di alcuni aggiornamenti specifici per drive Western Digital, purtroppo senza informazioni allegate su che cosa andassero ad agire). Resta un disco abbastanza rumoroso in esercizio e non particolarmente performante (per quello c\'è la serie BLACK) che mi sento di consigliare con riserva (anche se non è detto che le unità vendute oggi siano uguali, per meccanica ed elettronica, a quella che ho comprato io oramai un anno e mezzo fa). Si trovano unità a prezzi simili ma dalle prestazioni superiori. Ne sconsiglio, inoltre, l\'uso in sistemi NAS. La serie GREEN di WD non è pensata per i NAS, i punti forti dei green sono costi bassi per GB e bassi consumi. Per i sistemi NAS, se si vuole rimanere in ambito WD, meglio puntare sulla serie RED. Comunque circa 10 mesi dopo l\'acquisto del WD ho comprato un secondo hd da 3TB della Seagate (un ST3000VN000 della serie NAS HDD, equivalente alla serie RED di WD) pagandolo una decina di euro in più e, facendo le debite proporzioni (è un\'unità più recente e di una serie più ""pregiata""), non c\'è paragone per velocità e rumorosità. Inoltre essendo anche un\'unità progettata per i NAS mi aspetto anche una maggiore longevità.', 'Was kann man groß sagen? Eine sehr solide Platte, man bekommt viel Platz für seine Daten und wenn man sich Tests durchliest, scheint auch die Langlebigkeit sehr gut zu sein.', ""En remplacement d'un disque claquer dans un NAS"", 'Nienete da segnalare.

I also bought a 500GB version for another computer, and have had no problems with that one either.. But that one has only been in use for a few weeks so far.. but still, no problems.. So I still very happy with the purchase, but am leaving it at 4 stars, not because of any problems with the product, but because of WD's approach to, and lack of info about how their drives do not work with older systems very well, and the lack of info, and the hassle of getting the programs to run to make these drives compatible with older software. Luckily, this will not be a problem with most computers in use any more, as most are 7 and above, so being AF is not as big of a deal these days.. Info should still be included about AF drives though.. If not for that, I give the drive itself 5 stars in performance..-------------------------------------------------Original Review:I got this to replace a drive in a windows 7 computer that was starting to go bad. And when you have multiple bad sectors, it is going bad.From what I have seen, this has had pretty fast write speeds. It is quiet, and so far (only have been installed for a couple weeks now), reliable. If anything, I really only have one complaint about it.. AFD. or advanced format drive. What that is, is a drive, that the sectors on it, are sized at 4096b in size, where older drives are 512b in size.. so basically, each sector is 8 times bigger. The AFD (advanced format drives) are also known as 4k drives.. meaning 4 and K for thousand, not kilobytes, which is Kb. They have went to this, so that they can make the drives bigger and bigger in capacity. What does this mean to you. Well, that would all depend on what you are installing the drive in.You see, a lot of the code in older, regular windows 7 and back, computers, were written to use the 512b sectors, not the 4K ones. So for that reason, a lot of things will not run write on them. There are options around this, and those all depend on what you are doing, as to how you go about it. For example, WD makes a programs that will make the drive emulate the 512 byte sector, and it is called 512E, and the E is for emulation, which basically makes, whatever program or OS that you are using, make it think that it is a 512b sector, even though it isn't.Now, pretty much all computers, and drivers written since 2010, all support the 4K or AFD drives, which is also ones that have windows 7 with SP1 on them. As to older computers. Or say ones that only have windows 7, without service pack one, or even say windows XP, or basically, any OS before windows 7. Well, you, like I said, could run that WD align program. Another option, for some, more newer computers, is update the drivers. Like for example, intel chipsets have newer drivers then what came on regular windows 7. Update that driver set, and you should be good to go. While windows XP users, would need to run that WD Align program.What are some of the problems that are caused by this. First, windows update will not work. Yup, you got it. It will just error out. and I mean most updates will do this. MS even wrote patches that are supposed to fix this problem.. But they may not install because of the glitch on the update program. Even if it is a downloaded, offline install of it. It can still error out. With windows 7 computers, if you find the full install, and I do mean full, you can at least on the intel chipsets, update the drivers and things, so that things will work. The reason I say full is this. If you try to get just the drivers, some of them will tell you that you need .net framework version 4.5 installed to install them. The problem is, windows 7, pre SP1, does not come with anything over version 3 on it, so the drivers will not update or install. and because update is not working, you can not install .net framework version 4.5, even from an offline installer. Also, a side note.. The intel chipset drivers, even if you don't have a raid system, the drivers are still listed as being in with the raid drivers. So even though they say raid, at least on the intel ones, just download them and install them, because they should work. Which the full install package, has those updated files need to install, and does not use windows update to install it, so it will update fine.  Took me a but to figure this out due to the horrible setup on the intel site for getting the drives, which includes broken links, them leading to pages that don't have what they say it is supposed to have on it, and more. My opinion. Go into device manager, and find the installed drivers for the hardware. Look at the chipset name/version/type, and just do a search on the net for them, with the words full install, with it.Some of the other problems are, hardware may stop working. Even though the drivers are installed, they are written for 512b sectors, not 4k, so they will error out and not work. Other problems. You can get errors saying that the drivers are not digitally signed, even when they are. This is not a driver error problem, meaning that they are corrupt or not installed, just that the ones installed are not made for 4k, or AFD drives.If you run into problems like this. First thing to do. Do a search on the net for the drivers for your system, the full install packages, and install them. Do not rely on MS's driver fix updates that they have on their site. and dont rely on windows to find newer drivers for you. Also, some versions of hardware, mainly raid versions, you may have to manually add the drivers to the install package during the installation. This is mainly for computers that are not factory images. during the install, it will say at the bottom of the screen, press, and it will give a, I think it was an F key, to add different drivers during the install. That, or find some kind of 512E program that will make the drive like like a 512b drive. Anything newer then 2010 should have this problem fixed already, so computers with windows 7 SP1 on them, windows 8, 8.1, or 10, you should have no problems too.How do you know if it is an AFD drive. Well, if you read the label, it will say it right on it. Some drives will have a big AF in a box on the drive too. Ones like this one, if you look closely, in the print, it tells you. Basically, all newer drives are AFD drives, so you would have to get old stock to get something that is not AFD.As for this drive, once I got it all figured out, about the AFD limitations, and errors, with older hardware, then it was not that hard to get it up an running. But it took a lot of searching, and running around in circles to figure it all out. Also, I did read one other person that stated that to get the WD align program, to emulate the 512b sectors, you need to register your drive with them to get that program. They do have a link on their, the WD drives, that lead you to a page on the WD site that is supposed to help you with the program, or its requirements, etc. I looked on it, and could find no where on there, as to where to download the program. They even had a section on the side that asked you a few questions about the install, like if you filled it out, it would let you download the program and install it. It doesn't. That is unless they were having problems and the link to get the program was down.. but I would not count on it. As for me, I never tried the program for a couple of reasons. First, I did find the drivers, so I got it to work. Second, this drive got installed on a computer for someone else, and because of that, I did not want to register their drive, under my name, so I could not register it and get the WD Align program either. Which is why I had to find another way around it.So as for this drive, my opinions about it. Well, it has a good read/write speed, it is quiet, and works.. Really, what more do you want. It is a 7200 speed drive, and as such, they usually run a bit hotter then the slower drives. That is just normal. So far, it is working fine too. No problems. What more could you really want, looking outside of extended battery life that is. Yes, it is a good drive, at least so far."", ""I bought this HDD knowing what I was buying and definitely got what I wanted.  The only SSD/HDD I buy are from WD or Kingston.  I have had great experiences with both brands and have no complaints.SO HERE IS THE SCOOP!!!  As always, I'm big a the packaging especially when it comes to pc hardware.  Amazon, as always, packaged it well and it arrived on time with Amazon Prime.  Most people aren't really up to speed with the difference between HDD, SSD, and hybrid drives.  The SSD is self explanatory, so I'll move on.  I have 3 laptops.... HP Envy, HP tx2, and a HP g7.  All are running SSD and 2 laptops are running dual drives, one a SSD and one a HHD.  I started to buy hybrid drives first and quickly realized that at this point in time, hybrids are a waste of money.....  A big waste of money!!  This WD drive is in both laptops and they ARE as fast, or faster, than a hybrid.  Why? the reason is that hybrid drives learn your habits when you do the same thing(s) over and over, and stores the info to make the software load and run a lot faster.  The problem?  If you tend to do different things like myself, the hybrid drive is always learning, and because of this, it will not work like a SSD.  It will work like a 5400 rpm HHD that isn't a hybrid.  You money is better spent buying a WD 7200 rpm or another brand that your partial to that is also a 7200 rpm.  This WD drive is fast and the load time from power on to windows is a lot quicker as opposed to a 5400 rpm.  I have an old Dell tester laptop that took almost 2 minutes to fully load windows, with this drive it loads in well under 1 minute.  I test and help create software as part time employment, and I'm always looking for quality, innovation, and reliability.  And yes I'm very partial to WD drives because they work and they just keep going year after year.I almost failed to mention something very very important that most people may not be aware of....  These drives do not like to install Windows 8.1 when your doing a fresh install when you receive the drive.  My 2 newest WD HDD 7200 drives have an advanced format and would not read as an external drive in Windows 8.1 or as an internal drive when trying to install Windows 8.1.  Because I got a bit lazy, I installed Window 7 Ultimate and then Windows 8 read it as an external drive.  I then wiped the drive and the Windows 8 install was flawless.  I'm assuming I may have had an issue because the drive was used, but never really USED.  The prior owner most likely got confused on how to handle a drive with advanced formatting, as they work a little bit different and seem to be pretty specific to windows 7 until you reformat them.  This drive would not align with the Acronis cloning software the WD gives you for free when you buy their drives....  Any drive!!  That it in itself is nice perk, as long as you can get the drive to align."", ""come potete vedere da un piccolo test questo hdd non impressiona rispetto al suo fratellino minore.c'è da dire che windows 7 non supporta appieno i dischi advanced format. rifarò il test con windows 8.1 il prima possibile.WD7500BPKX-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 x64 (C) 2007-2013 hiyohiyo  Crystal Dew World : [...]-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]  Sequential Read :  106.009 MB/s  Sequential Write :  97.937 MB/s  Random Read 512KB :  43.287 MB/s  Random Write 512KB :  78.840 MB/s  Random Read 4KB (QD=1) :  0.545 MB/s [  133.2 IOPS]  Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  1.603 MB/s [  391.4 IOPS]  Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  1.343 MB/s [  327.9 IOPS]  Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  1.758 MB/s [  429.3 IOPS]  Test : 100 MB [C: 5.5% (38.2/698.5 GB)] (x3)  Date : 2014/07/31 16:06:27  OS : Windows 7 Professional SP1 [6.1 Build 7601] (x64)-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 x64 (C) 2007-2013 hiyohiyo  Crystal Dew World : [...]-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]  Sequential Read :  103.227 MB/s  Sequential Write :  101.655 MB/s  Random Read 512KB :  34.498 MB/s  Random Write 512KB :  58.864 MB/s  Random Read 4KB (QD=1) :  0.405 MB/s [  98.9 IOPS]  Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  1.223 MB/s [  298.6 IOPS]  Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  1.172 MB/s [  286.2 IOPS]  Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  1.207 MB/s [  294.7 IOPS]  Test : 1000 MB [C: 5.5% (38.2/698.5 GB)] (x3)  Date : 2014/07/31 16:21:29  OS : Windows 7 Professional SP1 [6.1 Build 7601] (x64)WD10JPVX-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 x64 (C) 2007-2013 hiyohiyo  Crystal Dew World : [...]-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]  Sequential Read :  104.094 MB/s  Sequential Write :  105.932 MB/s  Random Read 512KB :  40.761 MB/s  Random Write 512KB :  62.476 MB/s  Random Read 4KB (QD=1) :  0.499 MB/s [  121.9 IOPS]  Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  1.571 MB/s [  383.6 IOPS]  Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  1.480 MB/s [  361.4 IOPS]  Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  1.791 MB/s [  437.3 IOPS]  Test : 100 MB [D: 2.3% (21.7/931.5 GB)] (x3)  Date : 2014/07/31 16:10:49  OS : Windows 7 Professional SP1 [6.1 Build 7601] (x64)-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 x64 (C) 2007-2013 hiyohiyo  Crystal Dew World : [...]-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]  Sequential Read :  108.402 MB/s  Sequential Write :  107.392 MB/s  Random Read 512KB :  36.343 MB/s  Random Write 512KB :  51.703 MB/s  Random Read 4KB (QD=1) :  0.450 MB/s [  109.8 IOPS]  Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  1.170 MB/s [  285.7 IOPS]  Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  1.157 MB/s [  282.4 IOPS]  Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  1.203 MB/s [  293.8 IOPS]  Test : 1000 MB [D: 2.3% (21.7/931.5 GB)] (x3)  Date : 2014/07/31 16:15:41  OS : Windows 7 Professional SP1 [6.1 Build 7601] (x64)"", 'When any of my friends or family need a laptop, they usually ask me to find something for them. This is the hard drive I almost invariably pick. The computer I\'m writing this review on is sporting a WD7500BPKX. I give this hard drive 5 stars, but in reality, I would like to give it 4.9. While close to perfection, the drive does fall short in one area: noise. More on that later.I hadn\'t been with WD since the ATA Scorpio days, but a few years ago, I found this drive on Passmark\'s charts as the fastest mechanical 2.5"" drive that runs reasonably cool. Thicker enterprise 2.5"" drives can be quite quick, but aren\'t always appropriate for laptops because they run hot and obstruct airflow.Pros:Speed: This drive is quite fast. Most 2.5"" drives are painfully slow. While this drive is still a mechanical drive, you\'ll get a noticeable performance boost.Reliability: I\'ve installed about a dozen of these, to the point where I know the model number off the top of my head. No failures or SMART flags set to-date. I don\'t turn some computers off, I\'ve had these drives stand up to years of use.Durability: I try really hard not to drop laptops, but it does happen. I haven\'t broken one, none of my customers have yet either. Not a scientific test, but no glaring issues observed thus far.Temperature:After hours of use in an HP Probook 6735b, the drive remains at 38*c.The same drive in a Lenovo T500 rarely passes 34*c.This is the ideal operating temperature for a laptop hard drive. Over 40*c is getting warm, while over 50*c can be a concern. Interestingly, if you’re up on hard drive technology, temperatures under 30*c are also associated with issues. This drive keeps it right between the buoys at 34-38*c in most system.Cons:Noise: Bearing noise is quiet and consistent, but you\'ll hear a \'white noise\' or ‘shudder’ sound when the drive is seeking heavily. Not disruptive at all in a productivity setting, but with two computers running these in front of me now, I can most definitely hear them both. You will also occasionally hear the head load/unload noise as a subtle click. Again, nothing disruptive, most will not even notice. This drive is likely a little louder than your laptop’s fan.Overall:This is a very well-engineered drive. Noise is the only place where these drives fall short. You will know you have them whenever you\'re working in a quiet space. However, they seem to be reliable, and they\'re definitely fast. I’ve attached a screenshot of the Crystal Disk Mark results of this hard drive versus a standard OEM drive (probably like the one your computer came with). The results speak for themselves: the WD7500BPKX is significantly faster in many respects.UPDATE: Nov 2016 -I\'ve put many, many of these into service now. This is still my favorite hard drive. Many of the units have years of service on them now. Still ZERO failures. Woo hoo!', 'My two year old Sony Vaio laptop\'s Hitachi drive was on the way out - programs crashing, BSODs, hearing it go ""clonk"" while working and then not being able to access the drive and having to power off etc.First I looked at Samsung and Crucial SSDs - amazed at how far the prices have fallen and wanting to avoid these old style hard drives again with their moving parts, but still not wanting to pay possibly around 300 pounds when the equivalent in HDD is around £50.Although another Hitachi drive in the past was great, I wanted to avoid Hitachi this time as I found the hard drive division had been bought by Western Digital. Yep, even though this drive is a WD I wanted to avoid them too as I\'ve not had great experience in the past with WD longevity.So I looked at a couple of Toshiba ones, one of which had good reviews on Amazon, but on other sites the same drive series but with a higher capacity had poorer reviews. Toshiba had also acquired Fujitsu a few years ago - another make of HDD I hadn\'t had much faith in.So my search went on and I looked at Samsung, now (HDDs not SSD) bought out by Seagate who I\'ve also had failures with!Then I read an article written in October 2013 which said ""Marc Prieur, of hardware.fr, here are the hard drives failures rates according to a French e-tailer as of May 2013:1. Toshiba 1.15%2. Seagate 1.44%3. Western Digital 1.55%4. Samsung 2.24%. Note that the Samsung hard drive division is now owned by Seagate and consists mostly of rebranded Seagate drives.5. Hitachi 2.40%""This again pushed me back in the Toshiba direction and definitely away from Hitachi!But then I started looking at moving from 500GB to 750GB and from 5400rpm to 7200rpm. The speed, I found though, was not necessarily an indicator that modern drives are faster (too much to go into in this review!)In the end, I just went for this drive.When I first noticed signs of failure, I used my Acronis software to create a drive image onto an external drive. I also made an Acronis boot CD.When this new drive arrived, I took the failing Hitachi out and put this WD in. I booted up into Acronis and restored the image. I then got an error that BOOTMGR was missing and so my only option was to press CTRL ALT DEL to reboot on a never ending cycle. The solution to this I found was to put the old drive back in, create a Windows recovery CD, re install this new drive, booting now from the Windows recovery CD. This found errors and fixed them, but I still had the missing BOOTMGR. Some people have had to run the Windows recovery CD 3 times! With me it was 2. After that, the new drive loaded booted into Windows.As for speed, it\'s hard to say if it\'s a faster drive apart from the ""Windows Experience Index"" going from a 5.8 to 5.9 for the drive. Whether the booting and running faster is because it\'s really a faster drive or because it replaced a slowing down, failing drive, I don\'t know.I\'ve only had this drive a day and so time will tell how it goes. If money were no object, I\'d have bought a SSD as failure rates now seem to be a few percentage points below HDDs. I\'m sure they\'re better for laptops too, as far as no moving parts is concerned. For me now though, until SSD prices fall furhter, I\'m happy to have a WD system free of crashes', ""I purchased this hard drive as a replacement for a failing Toshiba stock hard drive in a mid-2011 Mac mini.  That Toshiba drive was the second one that had been installed in my Mac and both failed in the 3 years I have had the Mac.  So when I was looking for a replacement I did NOT want a Toshiba but I wanted something that was at least the same spec and size for a low cost.  This meets all of those requirements.  This drive is 7200 RPM which is faster than the 5400 RPM drive it replaced.  It also has a 16MB cache instead of the 8 MB cache in the Toshiba drive.  It also so happens that the drive I bought is the 750 GB version which is 250 GB more than the 500 GB stock drive it replaces.The performance of the drive is noticeably better than the other drive.  Load times are shorter and save times quicker.  I use VMware Fusion, which can be disk intensive at startup and shutdown.  This activity is much quicker with this drive.  I am not going to say it will blow your socks off and work like you have a new computer.  I will leave that to a solid state drive for 4x the price.  This drive is very inexpensive in relation to solid state and gives a very high performance per $ metric.The one minus I would take from this drive is it is not as quiet as the Toshiba drive I had.  I am used to notebook hard drive noises and don't mind the whoosh-whoosh here and there. However, this drive makes a click noise every so often that the other drive did not.  It just so happens it is almost the same noise as the Toshiba drive was making before I did the diagnostic and noticed it was failing so I am sensitive to the sounds.  I checked the Western Digital website and it seems this noise is normal and occurs when parking the hard drive heads.  I am guessing the Mac tells it to park the drive quite often in order to save power so that may be why I hear the noise sort of frequently.  I will probably get used to it but I am not sure why it needs to make this noise when other drives I have had have been fairly silent.  Overall this is a good performing drive from a company I have bought many reliable drives from in the past."", 'I purchased this drive to replace my existing Scorpio Blue in an Acer Aspire 5315 laptop.  I also had purchased a full copy of Acronis True Image 2014 from another source.  Using True Image I cloned my existing 320 Gb drive to the new 750 Gb.  This took about an hour at USB 2 transfer rates.  After this, I swapped drives and restarted my Acer and everything came up as before except it has been faster.  Acoustically the drive seems no louder than the drive it replaced and is in fact quieter than the cpu fan.  Doing backups, one with Windows System Image and one with True Image, the new drive attains over 100 Mb/s sustained transfer rate easily compared to the 65 Mb/s of the older drive.  After several hours, the drive is stable at 108 degrees F.  i had spent quite a bit of time reviewing the 7200 rpm possibilities of laptop drives and this seemed like the best option for the price.  This model was only a few dollars more than the 500 Gb model.  The manufacturing date is from November 2013 which is very recent.  I\'ve only had use of the drive for a few hours, but so far the transition has been seamless.  My Windows 8.1 Pro setup is operating just fine.  While my system does not have SATA 3 capability, I doubt this impairs the performance by running on SATA 2.  So if you are in the market for a laptop drive as a replacement, you must consider the size of the drive (2.5"" or now some are 1.8"") and height (9.5mm, 7mm, or 10 mm).  As for performance, unless I moved to SSD or hybrid drive, this is the fastest I can get.  SSD\'s are still pretty expensive for anything larger than 120Gb and while hybrids are cheaper, they are still more mechanical than SSD.  For me, my system needed a 9.5mm height drive and this fit the bill perfectly.', ""This is my second drive upgrade for my aging yet still relevant Dell XPS m1330. This 750GB Black is replacing my WD 320GB Black Scorpio. Unfortunately my computer can't handle the full speed of SATA III, so I'll still be getting SATA II speeds, but I will have a lot more space.After running the drive for about a week, my report is that the drive is very quiet and the speed is about the same as my last drive. As I've said, I cannot utilize the full speed of the drive because of computer limitations, and my previous drive also ran at 7200 RPMs. My old drive was not extremely noisey, but you could hear it. I cannot hear this drive at all. It also seems to run a bit cooler than my Scorpion drive did. The old drive gets pretty hot fast, although it still works fine after three hard years of service. I now use it for backups in a USB enclosure.I have come to rely on Western Digital for quality hard drives that perform well. I've never had a problem with one yet. I am pretty hard on my computers. I am a power user and daily user who does a fair amount of video rendering and other tasks that demand a hard working and reliable hard drive. WD works for me.BTW, the free Acronis SW makes installing a new drive a breeze, especially if you are using a previous drive in a usb enclouser or you have a free desktop bay to run both drives at the same time.

Sie steckt in einem Caddy da, wo vorher mein DVD-Laufwerk im Notebook war. Ich benutze die WD als Datengrab in Kombi mit einer SanDisk SSD Plus 120GB als Bootlaufwerk mit Windows 10.Da ich mit WD durch meine externe HDD (WD My Passport Ultra Metal 2TB) bereits positive Erfahrungen gemacht habe, und das außerdem die einzige (bezahlbare) 2,5'' 7200RPM 750GB-Platte auf Amazon ist, habe ich sie bestellt. Geliefert wird die Platte nicht in einer Verkaufsverpackung, sondern in einem etikettierten Pappkarton, in diesem mit zwei Halterungen fixiert und extra eingeschweißt. Die Platte macht sich akustisch kaum bemerkbar, jedoch ist sie etwas lauter als die Hitachi/HGST, was aber nicht sonderlich stört. Da kenne ich lautere Platten mit 7500RPM. Auch vibriert sie stärker und ist über das ganze NB hinweg zu spüren, das ist aber bei 7500RPM verständlich. Was mir aber gut gefällt ist, dass sie, wenn sie nicht genutzt wird ''pausiert'', was durch ein deutliches Klacken zu vernehmen ist. Bei Nutzung als Systemplatte ist das sicherlich störend, bei Verwendung als Datengrab jedoch nicht (meine Meinung).Auch mir fiel auf, dass die Platte nur 698GB (~700GB) anbietet, daher kriegt sie auch 1 ★ Abzug (auch wenn die HGST/Hitachi NOCH weniger bereitstellte). Zusätzlich positiv anmerken möchte ich die 5 Jahre Herstellergarantie, die man bei ''normalen'' Konsumentenplatten nicht kriegt (z.B. WD Blue) sowie das Tool ''Western Digital Data LifeGuard Diagnostics'', was sich kostenfrei bei WD runterladen lässt. Es zeigt und testet alle Systemlaufwerke, so bin ich hoffentlich vor dem nächsten Festplattentotalausfall gewarnt.Ich kann ich diese Platte nur weiterempfehlen."", 'My kid recently acquired a very old 40GB PS3 & figured out immediately that it needed a hard disk upgrade.

Zorin has gotten my attention because they have listened to the users (for a change) and created a flavor of Linux which can have an interface which looks like anything you've ever used: various flavors of Linux GUI, Mac OS, and several flavors of Windows. I don't know why it took someone so long to figure this out, but I'm glad someone finally did - give the users a choice in their GUI interface. Why is that so hard?But I digress. The drive installed easily, and I was able to install the Zorin Linux OS without incident. It seems to be running just fine, and has increased the speed of the machine it is in. That may be more due to the OS than the drive, but a fresh 1 TB drive certainly doesn't hurt.I will keep an eye on it and see if it develops problems like those some users have reported in RAID arrays.

The optimizations are tangible, though the differences in specs between drive families and sometimes even within the same family can be subtle, so having more information would be appreciated.This drive, a WD Network, is optimized for NAS duty. While similar to WD Red, WD Network is consumer oriented and features different firmware (WD Red has NASWare 2.0, WD Network has NASWare...I honestly don\'t know how they\'re different) and WD Red are rated for 600,000 load/unload cycles whereas WD Network does not specify a rating. (They both share the same 1,000,000 hour MTBF.)How are NAS drives different from Desktop ones? In a nutshell, NAS drives should be better balanced to minimize vibration, more tolerant of shock during operation, quieter, consume less power for reduced heat output, rated for operation at higher temperatures, and are generally lower performing but more reliable.I ran this 1TB WD Network drive in my work PC and a 4-drive NAS for this review. From my own testing, I can confirm that the WD Network ran cool and quiet and it performed rather well for sequential read/writes, though it suffered from higher latency compared to a 7200 RPM desktop drive. From a vibration perspective, whatever WD did with the Network drives, it seems to have worked. I performed an unscientific ""finger test"" and felt a few different drives in operation, and indeed the WD Network seemed to vibrate the least when compared to a WD Black 750GB and a Seagate 7200.14 500GB I had access to. Overall, I think it\'s a good drive and I will certainly look for either WD Network or WD Red drives for my future NAS builds.Notes:0) I reviewed the 1TB version of WD\'s Network Drive. The drive has 64MB Cache with an unspecified Spindle Speed, referred to only as IntelliPower. The interface is SATA 6Gbps, and I can confirm that the drive is capable of ~500MB/s bursts though actual sequential speed is between 160MB/s to 70MB/s.1) While optimized for NAS, this drive works fine on other applications, though at worst there is just a performance penalty.2) Network drives also supposedly have optimizations for streaming protocols, but I did not test this.', 'Initially I am using this as an external hard drive, and as I expected it works fine for that purpose.

I assigned a drive letter manually using the ""Disk Management"" option (right click on Computer or My Computer and select ""Manage"").Of course the idea behind this particular product is that it can be used in an ""always on"" machine and it will run cool and use minimal power.  Eventually I will install it internally and take advantage of that feature, but that requires a big reorganization of my home computer setup so for now, I will use it externally.', 'The hard drive met my expectations and the performace is consistent with the specs and description provided.

MASSIVELY DISSAPPOINTING"", 'I bought this drive to replace a failed 2 TB drive. Since I was replacing an existing drive it was plug and play. Installed the drive, formatted it and restored my data from my cloud back up. Fast and easy. Bottom line though is will it perform. Time will tell but so far everything is great. I now have 5.5 TB of storage on my home PC. At a cost of $65.00 great value for my money.']"

Because for $50, you're paying a lot for only 320 GB of storage. If I were to purchase a drive for a newer laptop, I would definitely go for something with more storage space and/or more speed, a la SSD. Currently, the 500 GB version of this drive is only $5 more, so definitely go for at least that size if you don't want to spend for more.Ideally, though, I would go the SSD route. A mid-range but well-regarded SSD will cost ~$130-150 for a 240 GB drive, and I would happily exchange the storage capacity for the speed that an SSD brings to the table.If you're looking for the least-expensive option, though, it's hard to go wrong with this drive. It's about as little as you can spend on a decent laptop hard drive, but just be aware that there are other options available if you can spend a little more."", ""I wasn't thrilled that the hard drive was sent in bubble mailer without any protection but it was at least in a anti static bag.

The drive tested fine and appeared that it was never used.

I used Samsung, Seagate and Western Digital hard drives.  In each case I used cloning software provided by the manufacturer.  I upgraded two computers using Samsung SSDs.  Samsung provides a CD with the software necessary for cloning.  Not only is Samsung's SSD outstanding, but their cloning software is outstanding as well producing a bootable hard drive without any additional intervention on my part.  Although Seagate does not provide cloning software with their drive, they allow the purchaser to download cloning software from their Internet site.  Seagate's cloning software is outstanding as well producing a bootable hard drive without an additional intervention on my part. Western Digital does not provide a CD but allows the purchaser to download Acronis True Image WD Edition Software.  Using this Acronis cloning software was a NIGHTMARE.  To begin with, It did not even recognize the Western Digital hard drive.  I was force to use Microsoft's Disk Management Utility to modify the drive in order for the software to recognize it. Upon completion of the cloning process, I discovered that the Acronis software altered the MBR of the original disk forcing me to perform a labor intensive modification of the original disk in order to make it usable again.  I want the original disks to be in operating condition because I use them as on-the-shelf backups in the event of a hard drive failure of the new drive.  I would not recommend the purchase of Western Digital hard drives unless the purchaser is very knowledgeable in hard drive technology. I would not hesitate to purchase Samsung or Seagate hard drive.

‎B00C9TEBJQ,WD Blue 1TB Mobile Hard Disk Drive - 5400 RPM SATA 6 Gb/s 9.5 MM 2.5 Inch - WD10JPVX,Storage,S$68.94,https://www.amazon.sg/WD-Blue-Mobile-Hard-Drive/dp/B00C9TEBJQ/ref=sr_1_348?qid=1695821519&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051%2Cp_36%3A4000-60000&rnid=6450031051&s=electronics&sr=1-348,https://www.amazon.sg/WD-Blue-Mobile-Hard-Drive/product-reviews/B00C9TEBJQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,4.5,"['This drive- (-once I finally got it installed and aligned properly, -and my drivers updated) -greatly sped up my laptop. I was frankly amazed at how much faster my programs started up and executed, -in many cases what seems at least 2-5 times as fast as with the original hard drive.(Update 12/14/2013: Now that I have had the drives installed for 3 months, I think that estimate is conservative: many things truly seem 10X as fast.)During the installation process, I was swapping the old drive back in: Even though I didn\'t have everything completely up and running yet on the new drive, it was easy to see how much faster it was than the original drive.I have a 5-year-old HP pavilion 17"" DV9933cl laptop which has been really reliable and dependable (and so I am reluctant to part with it) but it was running out of space on the original (320GB) Western Digital 3200BEVT drive, (which, incidentally, was still going strong). Hence, having had good results with the original WD drive, I bought 2 of these WD 2.5"" 9.5 mm height 1TB drives, intending to install them both in the laptop - which had an additional, empty drive bay. (I did have to purchase an additional drive caddy to install the second drive.) Although these are high density 1TB drives, they also are only 9.5 mm tall and will fit my laptop bays.When I received the drives one of the first things I realized was that these were of the new generation of ""Advanced Format"" (AF) drives, -which arrange files in 4096 byte sectors, rather than the 512 byte sectors of the older drives (- such as the one that originally shipped with my laptop). What this meant, for me, was that installing these new drives took longer than I expected, and there were some initial frustrations when I couldn\'t figure out why some programs (like Windows Update and Windows Indexing) were no longer working. But ultimately (after going back and forth to various support websites), I was finally able to get everything up and running, - and despite the additional work required, I am still very glad that I made this upgrade, because everything runs so much faster now, and my computer now truly performs ""even better than new"".There is a note, on the drive label, warning you that this is an AF (Advanced Format) drive, and that with certain operating systems (like Windows) you need to use a special utility (-WD Align, by Acronis -available for free download at WD\'s website) -in order to align the partitions of the new AF drives properly to take advantage of the new 4096-byte sector formatting. This is important - with many systems optimum performance and speed will not be realized unless this critical step is performed, and the drive may actually not even perform as well as the old one if this is not done.(This additional step is apparently not necessary for some operating systems (like Mac OS-X versions that can format GUID/GPT), nor perhaps for some newer Windows laptops that already have AF drives installed; but it seems that for many or most installs on older Windows laptops, where you are migrating or cloning an original drive that was not AF, the partition alignment utility is mandatory. If you have a newer Windows system/computer that automatically accommodates the new AF drives, you may not have to deal with this, and may actually just be able to install the new drive and be on your way. But since these drives are new technology, be prepared to have to search for, and install, some updated drivers if you have an older computer like mine.It\'s not initially clear whether the WD Align program is to be used prior to cloning the new drive, or afterward. After some initial problems, WD tech support suggested I run the alignment program before cloning the drive, (which is, naturally, faster than doing it afterward, and which is what I did, the second time. The instructions page at WD for the WD/Acronis True Image cloning program also seemed to suggest that the cloning program itself will perform the alignment, but after running the cloning program the first time, the WD Align software said the drives still weren\'t aligned.) In any case, you can easily check whether the drives are aligned or not:  if you open up the WD Align program and check the status of the drive, it will tell you. (If so, the drive will say ""Aligned"" and a message appears at the bottom of the window - ""All partitions are already properly aligned. No further actions required."")  (-If not, just run the WD Align program again.)Also, one important piece of advice: the first time I tried to clone the drive I tried to do it over the USB 2.0 port with a USB2 to SATA adapter. Besides taking forever, this may have contributed to some initial problems I had. I found it was far faster and more reliable cloning the drive with both source and destination drives installed in the computer drive bays (that is, if you have 2 bays) and connected to SATA (-Like 2 hours to clone the drive over SATA vs. 20+ hrs. over USB 2). The WD/Acronis True Image Manual recommends cloning the new disc in the drive bay where you will be using it. (They say this is especially important for laptops, and so this is what I ultimately ended up doing.)The drive ships in a user- and environment-friendly plain brown cardboard box with a couple of quite adequate packing spacers for padding. There are no printed installation guides, instructions, install software or anything else (other than the drive itself) in the box, so this might be a bit unsettling for those who (like me) are accustomed to all the things that used to come in the box when you bought a new hard drive. No problem: Even though the usual install software discs no longer are included, everything you need to install the drive can still be downloaded from Western Digital\'s  website. Besides the WD Align software (to align the partitions), you will probably want or need a cloning program, which WD also has available for download at their site as well, in the form of Acronis True Image, WD Edition. (It\'s really a great program). Again, it is free from WD to use on your computer- as long as you have a Western Digital drive you are installing that it can detect. In addition, WD has a lot of helpful support literature at their site, and I found their tech support quite helpful.I had some problems initially (just like a lot of other people apparently did, -when I checked online), -because in order to use these new AF drives on significantly older computers (like my 5-year-old HP laptop) there are apparently some additional things you need to do besides aligning the drive and cloning it. One of these was to download and install a special Intel Rapid Storage Technology (IRST) driver from HP, which they have available for download at their (HP\'s) site as SP47845 (Intel IRST driver version 9.5.6.1001). (In this case I had to figure out, the hard way, that I had to get this service pack/driver update from HP - and not from Intel, -nor from Microsoft.) The pertinent page at the HP website, ""Error Messages Appear During Windows Update,"" explained that ""Notebooks with the Western Digital high density hard drive, such as 1 TB or 750 GB, may display abnormal error messages if the Intel Rapid Storage Technology Driver (IRST) is not updated.""  ""Windows Update and other services may get error messages (""Windows update cannot currently check for updates, because the service is not running"") Depending on your make and model of computer, you may have to contact the manufacturer of your computer (HP in my case) -rather than Intel, for the correct IRST driver update. (I noticed during my web searches that other laptop manufacturers, as well, are recommending this same driver upgrade.)(Observation: When installing a new hard drive, it is often difficult, initially, to figure out where the best place is to go for support or drivers: The drive maker, the computer manufacturer, Microsoft, Intel? (-I think you get the idea). When problems arose, Western Digital Tech support was actually very helpful, and got right back with me in every case; but apparently -since mine was an HP laptop-, they could only help me so far - they didn\'t have the updated IRST driver I needed, -which had to come from HP. Some things aren\'t always obvious.)There was still one additional thing I had to take care of after installing the updated IRST driver, because somehow, even after the aligning, and cloning operations, and driver update, Windows Update still was unable to run or find the files it needed. After some more searching, I was able to download a simple batch file program off the web, from the Windows Vista IT Pro Forum (just do a search on Windows Update Failed Error Code 0xc8000247).  This batch file basically renames the Windows\\SoftwareDistribution subfolders (WuRedir, DataStor, Download,and SelfUpdate) where Windows Update looks for files, forcing it to create new ones, so it can find them again, and also stops and restarts wuauserv (the Windows Update Auto Server). Once I had done this, (and rebooted the computer yet one more time!) lo and behold, everything now worked, -and as I said, all of a sudden everything was now so fast. (Hope this info helps someone else, -who also runs into these same problems.)To be perfectly honest, the new drive, although so much faster overall than the original, does take a bit more time for a few things where, apparently, it is having to do some translation/conversion from 512 to 4096 bit: Closing programs and windows seems to take a little longer, and on some activities it does seem to hesitate, -but just a bit. On the other hand, I am amazed at how quickly programs now open, and execute. -YMMV, but you will mostly notice, I think, that the response of the new drive is simply a little different than what you are used to. But once I had experienced the speed of the new drive, I had no desire to continue using the old drive. (I had originally considered keeping it and using it as backup, but when I went back to the old drive for a few days while troubleshooting the new one, I became painfully aware of how slow the old drive was in comparison. And I do keep it defragmented, -and with adequate free space.).These drives are one of the best ways I have found to get a major performance upgrade on an older laptop. I am very pleased with them. They may require a little more work to install on older computers, but they are certainly worth the effort.', 'IMBALLAGGIO E CONSEGNA:(CONSIGLIO UTILE!)

Consegna in due giorni associata all\'altro acquisto prime.DESCRIZIONE E PREGI:Avevo bisogno di sostituire l\'HDD del portatile ed ho scelto Western Digital per la garanzia di affidabilità data dai rigorosi test d\'integrità funzionale (F.I.T.) che garantiscono la conformità del disco. La WD è una garanzia di qualità ed affidabilità, nata nel 1970, nonostante abbia vissuto un passato turbolento, vuoi per la crisi causata da una cattiva gestione che l\'ha vista sfaldarsi in piccole società proprio nel momento in cui vendeva alla grande nel 1991, vuoi di conseguenza al disastro Tailandese che ha portato alla perdita di buona parte di capitale nel 2011, si è ripresa sempre riaffermandosi ogni volta come leader mondiale presentando praticamente quasi tutte le innovazioni tecnologiche del settore dell\'Hard Disk dal 70 ad oggi. La mia azienda opera nel settore informatico ed acquista numerose unità disco WD al mese, nella mia esperienza non ho mai riscontrato HDD guasti. E\' costruito con alluminio rinforzato ed è progettato con un robusto motore Tied-Shaft che aumenta la resistenza dell\'unità allo schiacciamento del 30% rispetto ai modelli di questa classe venduti dalla concorrenza, caratteristiche che consentono di ottenere una struttura più rigida senza peggiorare le prestazioni o aumentare i consumi energetici; inoltre col tempo i ""Blue"" si sono ridotti notevolmente di peso, solo 122 grammi ed è lungo 100mm x 70mm di larghezza. Io ho acquistato il modello da 1TB, raggiunge una velocità di 5400 giri e per trasferimenti sequenziali arriva anche a 150MB/s partendo dalle tracce esterne, rallentando fino a 80MB/s verso il centro, alle tracce con raggio minore. E\' un disco molto silenzioso e soprattutto non si surriscalda, a pieno regime io l\'ho sempre sentito freddo. In definitiva al prezzo di 50€ è un\'affare considerando che di listino WD costa 80€. Lo consiglio per i portatili, un trattore adatto come disco primario o come unità esterna da montare su case esterno possibilmente USB3. Però bisogna scegliere i dischi in base alle esigenze dell\'uso che si vuole fare, per questo aggiungo due righe sulle tipologie proposte dalla WD, che ha diviso in colori le varie serie di modelli, escludendo WD Red, destinati ai NAS, WD Purple, destinati per sistemi di sorveglianza e i WD Gold destinati ai Datacenter, i seguenti sono per consumer:-WD Greensono dischi rigidi pensati per il massimo risparmio energetico e per la silenziosità. Non sono molto adatti come dischi principali perché non sono veloci come i Blue ma sono più adatti come dischi per storage.-WD Bluesono la perfetta via di mezzo tra gli efficienti Green e i performanti Black. Sono la scelta ideale per chi vuole avere molta capienza e discreta velocità con un budget ristretto.-WD Blacksono il fiore all’occhiello della gamma consumer di Western Digital. Sono i più veloci hard disk meccanici al mondo dopo i VelociRaptor! La tecnologia Stabletrac che consiste in un albero motore fissato alle due estremità dell’unità garantisce minor vibrazioni e maggior affidabilità.-WD VelociRaptorsono i dischi rigidi meccanici più veloci al mondo, hanno un MTBF di 1,4 milioni di ore che li rende molto affidabili e ideali per lavori come HPC, Rendering 3D, gestione immagini e computing scientifico. Il Pre-Emptive Wear Leveling garantisce l’affidabilità per applicazioni che eseguono un gran numero di operazioni di lettura/scrittura sulla stessa zona del disco, e ha la tecnologia NotTouch Ramp Load, significa che la testina di lettura/scrittura non tocca mai il supporto del disco garantendo minor usura.DIFETTI:al momento non ho riscontrato nessun difetto ma mi riservo di aggiornare la mia recensione in futuro dal momento che mi capita di notare qualche anomalia ingiustificata.', 'Holla die Waldfee, ich bin sowas von stinkig gerade ...Eigentlich möchte ich nur eine nutzbare 2.5"" 1TB Festplatte mit PMR (CMR), nicht so ein SMR Laufwerk mit unnötig viel Cache und unzureichender Datensicherheit für meinen NUC, der als NAS hier werkelt, eigentlich ...Amazon-Lieferanten sind ja noch scheuer, als Wildtiere im Wald, Namensschilder oder gar Klingeln scheint in deren Arbeitsauftrag leider nicht enthalten zu sein, obwohl die halbe Welt geimpft und gechipt wurde, somit eine versicherte Ware an den Empfänger übergeben werden kann, ohne dass man SOFORT tot umfällt.Geliefert habe ich die Western Digital WD10JPVX mit 1TB am 17.11.2022 bekommen, also ziemlich Flott.Aber dies in einem wenig vertrauenserweckenden M1 Pappumschlag von Amazon, in dem eine ""ungeöffnete"" Antistatiktüte welche sich in einem Mini-Luftpolsterumschlag mit der Festplattenbezeichnung und der Aufschrift ""NEU"" befand.Ausgepackt und getestet habe ich die Festplatte sofort unter Ubuntu und einem SATA-USB Adapter, da ich die Platte noch nicht in meinem NUC einbauen wollte.

que es la marca que siempre me ha dado más confianza en discos mecánicos y la que más me gusta tras SAMSUNG que es el líder en discos sólidos.Ahora bien, el embalaje es en mi opinión inaceptable y a punto estuve de devolverlo, al margen de que me llego un día más tarde de lo previsto y no pude llevármelo de vacaciones como tenia previsto (La empresa de transportes tuvo la desfachatez de indicar que no había nadie en casa, lo cual no era cierto, para justificar su retraso).Tras las pruebas pertinentes parece todo OK aunque siempre te quedas intranquilo cuando un disco te llega mal protegido...Sólo he tenido una única mala experiencia con WD en un VAIO que lo incorporaba de serie y se estropeó tras 2 años de uso intensivo, quedándome con la duda de si fue a causa de algún golpe o percance que no controlé pero, en cualquier caso, pude incluso recuperar la información...En esta ocasión, venía de una reciente experiencia de compra de 2 afamados HITACHI mecánicos (HGST) para hacer copias de seguridad de sendos discos sólidos SAMSUNG EVO, a la vista de que están tan bien considerados.Los 2 HITACHI de 7.200 rpm que adquirí tenían fama de ser de lo más rápido en tecnología mecánica (me llegaban a alcanzar los 150 MB/seg en lectura y escritura) y se suponía que también son de los más fiable del mercado según las estadísticas que se publican, pero mi experiencia me demostró que lo primero era cierto pero lo segundo no...De hecho, uno lo conservo y funciona a una velocidad sorprendente, aunque siempre me ha parecido más caliente y ruidoso que mis otros WESTERN DIGITAL, algo que le perdono puesto que es de 7.200 rpm frente a los 5.400 rpm de los otros WD que tengo...Ahora bien, uno de los 2 HITACHI se estropeó a los pocos meses de uso de una forma vergonzosa y estrepitosa (Información irrecuperable) por lo que será difícil que lo olvide...Gracias a AMAZON me lo cambiaron en garantía y por este motivo opté por este WD de nuevo y, en particular, uno de 5400 rpm por aquello de no volver a llamar al mal tiempo con discos mecánicos que van al límite de sus posibilidades...Este WD parece fiable, silencioso y razonablemente rápido (Unos 115-120 MB/seg frente a los 150 MB/seg del HITACHI) pero sospecho que no me dará problemas.Le quité una estrella por el embalaje y otra porque no alcanza los 144 MB/seg que anuncia (120 MB/seg a lo sumo), al margen de que el precio cayó 6 euros al día siguiente de comprarlo...Por lo demás, parece un disco bastante rápido para ser de 5.400 rpm y el tiempo confirmará o no si tiene la fiabilidad que espero de él, motivo

If you need a firm, fast, reliable, long HDD life and battery life saving with a very reasonable price, I would advice to go with this product. Note: The laptop itself has SATA II (3.0 G/b) capability, but it accepts this hard nicely and natively, which means you don't need to do anything further to make this HDD work as SATA II although it's SATA III (6.0 G/b). Windows 8.1 pro will format it with native 4k sector this is why it's fast in my system.

A parte i problemi iniziali per l\'installazione del firmware (che specifico debba essere la versione da 800 mb quello da inserire su pennetta e non da 300 mb) ho effettuato il ripristino del backup del precedente hard disk su quello nuovo da 1 tb. Qui ho avuto i primi problemi di rallentamento, malgrado tutto sembrasse andare nel verso giusto la console stava rallentando. Ho provato quindi a fare una ricostruzione del database andando in modalità provvisoria ma avevo ancora rallentamenti. Alla fine sono riuscito a risolvere lasciando in pace la console. A quanto pare si stava ancora assestando, scaricando o creando dei dati che a schermo non vedevo. Da qualche giorno sembrerebbe essere tutto a posto.

Before opening up computer, I backed up my OEM drive to an external drive. Also, whenever opening up the laptop, be mindful of static electricity. I wear nitrile gloves to avoid any discharge. Doesn’t take much to cause issues.2. RAM: Laptop recognized RAM automatically after restart and utilized right away. Showed up in System Information screen. Noticeably faster. Awesome. I also noticed that my fan, which usually runs at high speed about half the time, didn’t run high at all during all of this.3. SSHD: This computer has two hard drive bays. You can install the new drive into either bay. The original bay (on left) will be labeled “0”, and the second one is “1” in the Disk Management program in Windows 7. Since having both hard disks in the laptop, I was able to do all the following from the same laptop. Did some internet searching, but here’s how I installed new SSDH:a. Start \uf0e0 type, “Create and format”; should get a menu item that reads full, “Create and format hard disk partitions”.b. This will bring up the Disk Management program from which you can interface with the hard drives on your computer. My new SSHD was labeled default, “Disk 1”, and reading as, “Online”.c. Right click on Disk 1 \uf0e0 New Simple Volume… This will allow you to copy files to that drive.d. Assign whatever letter and name you want. It will get changed by Windows later to C:. (I named mine “A:”).e. You should be able to now see the new drive show up in Windows Explorer.f. Now to install from OEM to new drive to become the primary. (If you simply want your new drive to be the secondary, then copy and paste whatever you want to the new drive – it does not need an OS to do this):i. I used Macrium Reflect Free. Install this or whatever mirroring software you choose.ii. My OEM drive has a C: partition and a D: Recovery partition. If you copy both these to the new drive, then the new drive will use only the amount of memory that is required for these drives, and deem the rest of the new drive as “Unallocated”. You can extend the memory range only for the partition that is physically next to this unallocated partition within Disk Management. If you copy both the C: and D: partitions of the OEM drive, then the D: Recovery partition will be the only one you can extend, as it will be physically next to the unallocated partition. So…iii. Using your mirroring program of choice, copy ONLY the C: partition. This will allow you to extend the memory space of this partition to all but a small amount of the new drive.  May take a couple hours. (*Note: One of the options is to create a Dynamic partition. This will allow that partition to communicate with other separate drives. I didn’t find this necessary.)iv. Go back into Disk Management and make a New Simple Volume of this small space on the new drive. Label as, “Recovery”. (*Note: I was not able to copy the D: Recovery partition from the OEM to the new drive. When I tried through Macrium the last screen prior to initiating this move said it was going to format the A: drive. You may be able to get this work.)v. Go back to Disk Management (via, “Create and partition” in Start search bar). You should see a clone of your C: partition on your new drive, and a formatted, empty D: Recovery partition.g. (After some internet searching it was said that I would need to change the boot order within BIOS to read the new drive first during boot. However, I found this not to be necessary.)h. Shut down laptop and take the OEM drive out of the left bay and put the new drive into that bay. Leave the OEM out for now.i. Reboot. This may take a minute or so due to system reconfiguring.j. Check Windows Explorer. The new drive, now in the left bay, should show up as C: and D: Recovery. This is now the new boot disk for the laptop. It may even be a good idea to restart, just to make sure all is in order with the new drive.k. You can put the OEM drive into the right bay if desired. Windows will automatically label the partitions in the OEM drive. This is a nice alternative to having an external drive. You can use this as a backup or whatever. It’s nice to have immediate access to an old version of your files in case something happens within the new drive.4. Hopefully this was helpful.

Deshalb musste für die monatlichen kostenlosen Spiele-Downloads eine neue Festplatte her. Zunächst war der Kauf einer gewöhnlichen HDD geplant; nach kurzer Recherche wurde ich jedoch auf SSHDs (Hybridfestplatten, deren gewöhnlicher mechanischer Speicher um schnellen Flash-Speicher erweitert wird) aufmerksam und stellte fest, dass man für 500GB Speicher zu einem nur geringen Aufpreis von ca. 15 € (zu einem vergleichbaren HDD-Modell mit 500GB) einige der Vorteile einer reinen SSD bekommt und dies auch mit einer PS3 funktioniert.Die Meinungen bezüglich des Nutzens einer SSD in der PS3 gehen auseinander; viele sehen den hohen Preis der SSDs für den erhaltenen Geschwindigkeitszuwachs als nicht gerechtfertigt an - angesichts der Verfügbarkeit von Hybridfestplatten (SSHDs) neige ich dazu, dem zuzustimmen. Die Leistungsunterschiede zwischen normaler HDD und den Flash-Platten sind definitiv spürbar (dazu später mehr); der zwischen SSD und SSHD jedoch zumindest auf der PS3 kaum erwähnenswert, wobei die SSDs bis jetzt deutlich teurer sind. Somit lohnt sich meiner Meinung nach der Einbau einer SSHD in eine PS3 definitiv und ist absolut zu empfehlen.Im Detail:- Produkt:Die Seagate ST500LM000 ist eine 2,5""-SSHD (Hybridfestplatte) mit 500GB Speicher bei 5.400 Umdrehungen pro Minute und 8GB Flash-Speicher. SSHDs sind mit einem ""lernenden"" Chip ausgestattet, was bedeutet, das oft verwendete Dateien (wie beispielsweise beim Boot-Vorgang) im Flash-Speicher abgelegt werden und darauf schneller zugegriffen werden kann. Die Platte passt problemlos in die Halterungsschiene der PS3.- Einbau (mit Datentransfer) in PS3 fat 80GB:Da ich nicht alles neu konfigurieren, installieren und herunterladen wollte, mussten die Daten vorab gesichert werden. Hierfür benötigt man eine externe USB-Festplatte (natürlich mit ausreichend Platz für die Sicherungsdatei) im FAT32-Format (hierfür gibt es kostenlose Formatter, einfach googlen) sowie einen USB-Datenträger mit der neuesten Firmware (benötigt man in jedem Fall, auch ohne Datentransfer). Nach der Datensicherung via [Einstellungen] > [System-Einstellungen] > [Datensicherungsprogramm] konnte der Einbau vollzogen werden:1. PS3 vom Strom trennen,2. Deckel an der linken Seite der Konsole abnehmen,3. Sicherungsschraube per Kreuzschraubenzieher abschrauben,4. Halterungsschiene mit alter HDD rausziehen,5. durch Entfernen der vier Schrauben HDD von der Halterung trennen,6. neue Platte befestigen und zurück in die PS3 schieben,7. Sicherungsschraube wieder anschrauben und Deckel drauf -> fertig.Dieser Vorgang dauerte keine fünf Minuten und klappt problemlos. Danach alles wieder anschließen, USB-Datenträger mit der Firmware einstecken und PS3 starten. Dann den Anweisungen folgen und nach einem weiteren Restart ist die PS3 mit neuer SSHD einsatzbereit. Nun schließt man die externe Festplatte mit der Sicherungsdatei an und wählt erneut das [Datensicherungsprogramm] aus, um die Dateien wiederherzustellen (dauert in etwa so lange wie die Sicherung zuvor). Anschließend ist alles in genau dem Zustand wie vor dem Festplattentausch. Wichtige Anmerkung: Trophäen werden NICHT übertragen, diese daher unbedingt vor dem Tausch mit dem PSN-Server synchronisieren! Nach Umbau den Vorgang wiederholen, damit die Trophäen wieder da sind. Für den gesamten in diesem Punkt beschriebenen Vorgang gibt es auf YouTube hervorragende Video-Guides, in denen alles Schritt für Schritt erklärt wird.- Leistung:Der wichtigste Punkt - ist die SSHD den Aufpreis gegenüber einer gewöhnlichen HDD wert? Meiner Meinung nach DEFINITIV. Bereits beim Booten zeigt sich eine deutliche Verbesserung. Die XrossMediaBar-Benutzeroberfläche ist gleich nach Beendigung des Bootvorgangs flüssig und schnell nutzbar, auch die Symbole der einzelnen Punkte müssen nicht erst mit Verzögerung nachgeladen werden. Gleiches gilt in der Trophäenliste, die ich als besonders langsam erachtet habe; mit der SSHD funktioniert alles blitzschnell. Vor allem beim Öffnen des XMB während eines laufenden Spiels merkt man den Unterschied. In Spielen macht sich die neue Festplatte ebenfalls deutlich bemerkbar: GTA V lädt gefühlt nur noch halb so lange wie zuvor und hat in-game deutlich weniger Probleme mit dem Nachladen von Texturen. Assassin\'s Creed 3 startet ebenfalls merklich schneller und die Ladezeiten beim Gebietswechsel sind auch verkürzt. Dasselbe bei Red Dead Redemption bezüglich des Startens. Bei auf der Festplatte befindlichen PSone-Classics konnte ich keinen Unterschied feststellen, hatte hier aber auch keinen erwartet. Alles in allem beschleunigt sich die PS3 subjektiv deutlich und macht die Benutzung angenehmer. Anmerkung: Die Spieleinstallation von BluRays ist selbstverständlich unverändert langsam - dies liegt an der niedrigen Lesegeschwindigkeit des BD-Laufwerks der PS3 und lässt dich nicht durch den Festplattenwechsel beschleunigen.- Laustärke und Wärmeentwicklung:Die Festplatte ist in der PS3 nach meinem Empfinden absolut unhörbar. Temperaturmessungen habe ich nicht vorgenommen, gemäß im Internet verfügbaren Berichten bleibt sie jedoch durchgehend kühl.Fazit:Die Anschaffung der SSHD für meine PS3 lohnt sich meines Erachtens eindeutig. Der Bootvorgang und das Laden der Spiele wird beschleunigt und die Benutzeroberfläche läuft merkbar flüssiger. Der Aufpreis zu einer normalen HDD ist angesichts des deutlichen Leistungszuwachses sehr gering und der Preis ist weit unter dem einer reinen SSD bei annäherend gleicher Leistung einer solchen. Somit eine klare Empfehlung hierfür.Bei einer PS4 allerdings könnte der Unterschied zwischen einer SSHD und einer SSD aufgrund der Dateigrößen eventuell deutlicher sein. Hier gibt es ebenfalls Berichte mit genauen Messdaten im Internet zu finden.', 'UPDATE:  3/20/14I am revising my previous negative review (below).  I have finally learned what was going on.  Nothing was wrong with the Seagate SSHD.  The problem was with my MacBook Pro.After giving up on the Seagate drive, I ordered a Western Digital 1 TB drive, assuming that it would work in my laptop.  But it didn\'t.  My MacBook Pro absolutely refused to recognize the WD drive or the Seagate drive, yet it booted fine with the original drive it came with.So I did a little research, and learned that a very common problem with the unibody MacBook Pro series was defective SATA drive cables.  Furthermore, the SATA drive cable also includes the sleep sensor assembly.  That was the ""Ah-ha!"" moment for me, as my MacBook Pro had recently developed an annoying habit of occasionally failing to go to sleep when the lid was closed.  It looked as if the two problems were related.I then took my MacBook Pro to the Apple store and explained my problem.  The technician did some additional diagnostics and replaced both the original HD and the SATA cable.  I went back home, plugged in the Seagate SSHD, and .... success!  The Seagate SSHD was immediately recognized and formatted.  Now that I have completed the system recovery, I\'m actually very pleased with the speed of the drive.  Startup is noticeably faster, as is the loading of frequently used programs like Safari and Mail.  As long as the data can be cached, the response is significantly faster than an ordinary HD.So the lesson is this:  if you have a newer MacBook Pro, and you absolutely cannot get it to recognize this drive, then replace the SATA cable, even if your laptop works just fine with its original drive.  If your laptop is no longer covered by AppleCare, go to the iFixit web site and learn how to replace it yourself.  It is not difficult to do, and it will save you many hours of frustration._____________________I bought this drive to upgrade my mid-2012 13"" MacBook Pro (S/N identifier DTY3).  Unfortunately, this Seagate drive is not compatible with my MacBook Pro.  Despite repeated attempts on my part, Disk Utility refused to recognize the drive, even in Internet Recovery Mode.  The drive did not even show up in the Disk Utility menu; as far as my MacBook Pro was concerned, it wasn\'t even connected to the SATA cable.In order to check if the drive was defective, I then installed it in a late 2006 white plastic MacBook (S/N identifier WGL).  The MacBook immediately recognized the drive, and I formatted it as an OS X Extended Journaled disk.  I then put the drive back into my MacBook Pro, with no change.  The drive simply will not communicate with the mid-2012 version of the MacBook Pro.So beware if you intend to upgrade a newer MacBook Pro with this drive.  Some reviewers have gotten it to work with their Apple laptops, but clearly there are models that are completely incompatible with this Seagate SSHD.  It is particularly interesting to me that my old 2006 MacBook had no problem with the drive, but the MacBook Pro could not use it. It\'s a shame, because I really wanted to see how this drive performed.', ""I bought this for my ps4 about three months ago. I love it. I really like how easy it is to change the internal HDD on the ps4. The only part that I had trouble with installing this 1TB hybrid was with getting the firmware for the ps4 to be recognized by the ps4. I downloaded the 858mb file or whatever size that download was from the play station website. That was a nightmare...I kept getting error messages and I was almost pulling my hair out for hours!  Fortunately one of my best friends is a computer networking specialist. He figured out that I had made a clerical error when naming one of the folders that the ps4 has to read to install the firmware to the Seagate hybrid HDD. Also, make sure you upload all your save files to the playstation cloud PRIOR to removing your OEM hard drive that was included when you purchased your ps4. If anyone needs help installing this drive, feel free to message me. I'd gladly help someone avoid  the flash drive issues that I encountered while trying to get the ps4 to re initialize its operating system. Another important point I read is that the ps4 doesn't always like flash drives bigger than 8GB. I HIGHLY recommend just buying a new 8GB flash drive for like 7$ and use that for the ps4 firmware. Also, make sure you download the bigger 858mb file on the playstation website; NOT the smaller update file. Go all the way down to the bottom of that page. It's not completely clear to do that when you go to download the firmware.  As far as changing the hard drive itself....it's ridiculously easy. It's only 5 Philips head screws. Just go to the hardware store and buy a Lutz 2-in-one green Philips head screwdriver and you'll be good to go. Overall this HDD is fantastic. It definitely improves load times for games that have longer loading screens like Destiny and The Evil Within. It has a 6GB per second speed when installing games and a 22GB game like Destiny was ready to play in less than 10 min!!  My last tips are: make sure you install the game you want to play first and THEN download the save files for that specific game after its completely installed. You need to rinse and repeat that process for every single game you own unfortunately. And FINAL point.....buy a PS+ membership PRIOR to removing your old hard drive. If you have a ps+ membership you get free cloud storage for your saves and you DONT have to mess with game saves on a flash drive. Even if you don't want ps+, buy a 3 month membership JUST to make the installation of this hard drive and to download your cloud game saves on to the Seagate drive. It could possibly save you hours of frustration since the ps4 DOESNT recognize every brand of flash drive and losing all your game saves and progress would be the worst possible thing that could happen.  Well that's it. Good luck to all. This is a great hard drive and I'm glad Sony allows and encourages us to install a bigger hard drive....not being able to upgrade your hard drive on the Xbox one is ridiculous. And internal hard drives are better than external HDDs plugged in with a usb."", ""Seagate 1TB Gaming SSHD SATA 32GB NAND SATA 6Gb/s 2.5-Inch Internal Bare Drive (ST1000LX001)\nLong story short:So far, it's been great. Cloned an old Western Digital Scorpio Black (which worked well), and noticed quicker boot time and software opening times. Read below for the long story.Long story:I have a relatively old Dell Latitude laptop running Windows 7 Pro. I use the PC primarily for surfing, writing, basic Excel applications, streaming/downloading vids, and listening to music. The HDD is a 320 GB Western Digital Scorpio Black, which is from 2011, but works fine. Only problem is that I had only about 10% left on the HDD, so I wanted to upgrade to something bigger because I hope to keep the laptop at least another year or two.I debated getting an SSD. But 500 GB would be at least $200 to $250 for a good, mainstream brand, and it didn't seem worth it just for an additional 180 GB, even if it is blazingly fast. A 1 TB SSD would be at least $300, and too much to spend for an upgrade.I've never bought a Seagate drive by itself (but perhaps I've had them in previous computers). I've only purchased Western Digital as separate drives, and I've had good experiences with Western Digital. But when I searched around online, it seemed like this Seagate SSHD offered the best combination of speed, space, and, hopefully, reliability and durability. So I bought it.Got it a week ago (1-day Prime was 1 day late, but that's another story). Also purchased a Sabrent USB 2.0 enclosure. Used EaseUS ToDo BackUp Free 8.6 to clone my original HDD. It took about 6 hours to clone it, longer than I thought (I think because my Dell has only USB 1.1 and not USB 2.0 or 3.0). Swapped out the drives. The Seagate booted right up the first time, and did seem faster, but perhaps I was just hoping it would be. The second, third, and fourth times I booted up and opened up programs/apps like Outlook, Word, VLC media player, etc,, were definitely noticeably faster than with the old drive. How much faster? I don't know, but I am sure I'm not imagining things because previously Outlook and VLC media player would take at least 20 or 30 seconds (just a guess) to open. I'd imagine it's half of that now. Pretty amazing.So far I am very happy with this drive and would recommend it, especially because of the value. The only thing I'm concerned about is the durability. Will I get five years out of it? Based on some reviews, it seems like that's unlikely even though it supposedly has a five-year warranty. I'm almost certainly going to get a new computer well before then, but I may hang on to this Dell another two to three years if, hopefully, the SSHD lasts that long. I expect it to, but we'll see.Disclosure: I recently bought some shares of Seagate stock (actually before I bought the SSHD)."", 'I felt compelled to write a review specifically for how this drive performs as a replacement for the 500GB 5400RPM drive that comes stock in the Playstation 4. I\'ll explain why this is the best drive for what I feel are the three main points to consider: Storage space, speed, and price.*Storage space - 500GB will not be enough space for this system in the long-run. The operating system and other mandatory installs take up just under 100GB of space on your drive. Games are now running at full 1080p resolution as well, which makes the game sizes enormous. Most games will take up between 20-50GB. Assuming you are left with about 400GB of usable space after the OS, that will allow approximately 20 games to be installed on your drive if the games are on the SMALL side. The actual amount of games you will be able to fit may be significantly less, as games like Killzone: Shadow Fall are about 40GB. The solution to this issue may be to uninstall games as your drive fills up, but this is inconvenient and you may want to play those games again. As hard drive technology evolves over the coming years, I could see a 2TB hybrid drive being a tempting purchase for myself.*Speed - There is a LOT of misinformation in the reviews on the performance of this drive. Seagate advertises ""SSD-like performance"". This is simply not true. Solid state drives are drastically faster than both traditional hard disk drives and hybrid drives like this one. This hybrid drive can get close to solid-state speeds when it comes to certain tasks, thanks to Seagate\'s adaptive memory technology. Seagate\'s Adaptive Memory technology essentially allows the drive to ""remember"" tasks that are frequently performed, store the information for those tasks in the solid-state cache, and give impressive speeds for those tasks. Most often, these speed boosts will be noticeable in booting up your system, shutting down your system, installing software, and launching applications. I also have to say that the speed boost for these is much more apparent on a PC.  For the actions I\'ve just mentioned, you will see an improvement in performance if you were to do an A/B test with the stock drive, but it will not be mind-blowing like having a fully solid-state drive installed on a Windows 8 computer. While playing games on the PS4 with this hybrid drive installed, loading times may be decreased slightly, but again this will not be mind-blowing.*Price - With what I\'ve just explained in the speed portion of my review, you may be asking why I\'d even bother recommending this drive as a replacement, let alone the BEST replacement for a PS4. The reason is price. No, the speed boost compared to a traditional HDD will not blow you away when used in a Playstation 4. Even if it isn\'t huge, the speed boost is definitely there, and the cost of this drive is comparable to traditional non-hybrid drives. A 1TB SSD will cost you around $600 at the moment. This makes this a no-brainer. In my opinion, given the size of ""next-gen"" game installs, it is completely necessary to upgrade to a 1TB drive (or larger in the future). With all things considered, as of the time this review is written, installing this in a PS4 just makes the most sense.', 'My 2012 MacBook Pro 13"" suddenly quit recognizing its hard drive. This was the last straw for an unknown - and apparently unsolvable issue - that had been plaguing my laptop since February. I thought it was a software issue. After all, I had just purchased this MacBook in July 2012, and previous to that, my 2005 iBook had lasted for almost 8 years with no hardware or software issues. But, about 6 months ago, my computer suddenly got slow. Apps took forever to open. Boot up time was over a minute (from the push of the power button to the first mouse click to open my browser.) All in all, it was if something was hogging my CPU. I spent more time looking at the damn spinning beach ball than anything else. I spent the last six months combing message boards, Googling the issue, trying every solution under the sun. Nothing worked. I even wiped the hard drive and reinstalled the OS. No fix. I\'ve been an Apple user for almost 10 years, and I was ready to go back to Windows as this point.Then, two weeks ago, my computer froze, and, when I rebooted, I got the flashing folder icon with a big question mark. Long story short, my hard drive was suddenly not recognized by the system. After some more Googling and research, I discovered I had two choices: buy a new HD or a new HD cable. I\'m not a computer hardware expert, and I didn\'t have the $69.99 to pay Best Buy Geek squad to do a hardware test. So I started researching HDs on Amazon. This product, the Seagate 1 TB hybrid drive seemed to have the best reviews of all the products I looked at. I had only enough $$ to buy a hard drive or a cable. Not both. So I gambled and bought the HD first.Long story short, it wasn\'t the HD that failed. It was the HD cable. I installed the new HD, replaced the HD cable, and bought an external case for my old 750 GB internal HD. After almost a week of using my new Seagate hybrid drive, I\'m rather impressed. All the other reviews for this product are accurate. This drive is whisper quiet, it doesn\'t get hot, boot up time is less than 5 seconds (from the push of the power button to the first click of the mouse to open my browser), and my most-used apps open in literally 3 seconds or less.Bottom line: my MacBook Pro performs better than when I bought it. The issue that had been plaguing me for the last 6 months was the result of the failing HD cable, but buying this new hybrid HD was a much needed bonus. I definitely recommend it. (It was very easy to replace too. As long as you have a proper toolkit, the whole process takes less than five minutes, start to finish. There\'s also an excellent tutorial on www.ifixit.com.)']"

This is a bare drive with only whatever packaging is used by the seller.  You can also buy it in a box with foam padding under the model name ""PH3300U"".  I can\'t comment on Amazon\'s packing, because I bought it from a different site.Because drives and firmware sometimes change, I should specify mine.  I don\'t see a clearly labeled firmware version on the label of my drive, but it does say ""DRIVE REV AAA AA00 / BB0"".  It also is marked with the number HDKPC08A0A01.  This unit was made in Aug-2014. On a scale, it weighed 1.473lbs.Real capacity is 2.729TB when measured in proper base-2 units.This is a 7200rpm drive. It uses 1TB platters.Performance and Noise=================After 6 months of use, I recently tested this drive\'s performance under Linux Mint 17.1 using the ""gnome-disks"" utility.  Screenshot is attached.  Please note that the linear transfer rate values in that graph are base-10 measurements, not base-2.  They would be a bit less when expressed in base 2.This drive has moderate access times for a 7200rpm drive, but it is quiet.  This is a popular formula - faster drives are louder, and people tend to complain about that nowadays.  The access time measured was 15.18msec average with a test of 5000 random seeks.  This test covered the full 3TB capacity, not short stroked.  I could not hear any seek noise during this test unless I put my ear next to the drive, and then it was just faintly audible.  However, I do not have a quiet PC.  People who build quiet PCs might hear seek noises more easily than I do.  To me, I couldn\'t even hear the test running until I got my ear next to the drive.  I also tested a 4TB Toshiba MD04ACA400, and observed that they are complete opposites in respect to seek noise vs speed.  This 3TB DT01ACA300 is the slower but much quieter drive - it\'s inline with most modern consumer 7200rpm drives.Reliability=======I\'ve had this drive in operation for 6 months.  It was initially subjected to a burn-in period using the linux utility \'badblocks\'.  That took 48 hours of continuous stress to complete, which it did with no errors.  It then completed the SMART extended self-test, again with no errors. The intention was to weed out any infant mortality before putting real data on the drive.Since that time, up until a few days ago, it has been used as the parity drive for a SnapRAID array.  In that role, the drive spent most of it\'s time spun down.  When it was accessed, it would see continuous stress for a few hours at a time.Recently I\'ve moved it to file storage, and another drive has replaced it for parity.  This drive is still working fine, it does not have any faults logged in SMART.During the initial burn-in period, the highest temperature recorded in the SMART data was 38C, probably about 10C above ambient. That was during the very long \'badblocks\' test with a fan blowing through the drive cage.  I don\'t know how much warmer it would get without the fan, but every case will be different.  Opinions vary but I\'d say anything up to 45C is nothing to worry about.No ""Intellipark""============I do not believe this drive has any auto head parking behavior.  I\'m glad for this, because I believe head parking should be left under control of the operating system, not arbitrarily forced by a drive\'s firmware.I used the linux ""watch"" command to watch the ""load/unload"" counter in the drive\'s SMART data with a timer of 5 minutes.  The drive was otherwise unmounted and not being accessed.  This means the only access to the drive was on those 5 minute intervals.  Therefore, if the drive were auto-parking itself, I should have seen the ""load/unload"" counter increase at every 5 minute update.  I did not - the ""load/unload"" counter stayed constant, and was at a very low number.  That is why I\'m convinced it does not auto-park.It should still respond to head parking commands from the OS, as any hard drive has been capable of doing since the days of MS-DOS.  It most definitely responds to spin-down commands, I\'ve had the OS configured to spin it down after 30 minutes of inactivity and this has worked fine.Partitioning comments---------------------The tool I used for partioning this drive was \'gdisk\'.  This is a linux utility which is very similar to the familiar \'fdisk\', except it is designed to work with GPT partitioning instead of traditional MBR.  In a GUI environment, \'gparted\' is another way to partition the drive.  At the command line, the console equivalent is \'parted\', but I used \'gdisk\' instead because it was easier to understand.Although technically there may be some workarounds, GPT partitioning is essentially required if you want to partition drives larger than 2TB.  If you are only seeing something like 700GB of space on this drive, it is because you are using an outdated MBR partitioning tool which will not work properly with drives of this size.Under Windows, note that 3TB drives (anything > 2TB) cannot be properly used with 32-bit Windows XP or older versions.  This is because they don\'t support GPT partitions.  Limited support for GPT was added for 64-bit WinXP, but not for a system drive, only for a data disk.  GPT support is better in later Windows versions.In an experiment on my system, I found that >2TB drives don\'t even appear in the WinXP-32 Disk Management screen.  It only became visible if I used HDAT2 to reduce the drive\'s reported size to 2TB.>2TB drives might work with patched versions of Vista, but I don\'t know.  I expect at least Windows 7 should support them.  Please research this before buying.This would not be a problem for using the drive over a network. It\'s only an issue for mounting it directly on the system.If you\'re using WinXP-32, then stick to the 2TB model or below.  Those sizes will work fine.  However, the remaining point to be aware of is that these drives (even the smaller sized models) have 4KB sectors with 512 byte emulation.  This is something older Windows versions don\'t understand.  The partitions need to be aligned with these 4KB sectors for the drive to perform it\'s best.  This won\'t keep it from working but it\'s a performance issue.Don\'t use the partitioning that is built-in with WinXP, or the alignment will not be correct and performance will suffer.  Instead, I suggest downloading \'gparted\' and running that tool from a bootable CD or flash drive.  This tool has an option to align your partitions on a 1MB boundary. Use that option while creating the partitions, and you\'ll be good. Then reboot back to Windows and let it format the partition(s) that you already created. Formatting under XP is fine, you just don\'t want to let it create the partitions.', 'Finalmente ho trovato degli HD di qualita,  verificati con il programma per leggere il file SMART', 'it works fine, i will post an update if it does break.I bought this one because an ssd it is harder to recover the data when they break and they go bad just like a hard drive.', 'Rien à dire.

Ciao a tutti.', 'I\'m going to start by saying that my sole reason for purchasing this hard drive is to upgrade the hard drive in my PS4.There are two ways to upgrade a PS4 hard drive using a 3.5"" desktop hard drive. 1) Using the Nyko Data Bank  2)  Using an external enclosure to power the hard drive, and running a SATA extension cable from the extension or hard drive to the PS4.I chose to use an external enclosure to house and power this Toshiba hard drive and run a SATA extension cable from the hard drive to the PS4. I\'m not going to go into great detail about the process or set-up, but I will be happy to answer any questions and provide help for anyone that may have questions on how I ran my set-up.I spent approximately 2 months doing research and reading every single review for over 10 different hard drives I was considering putting into my PS4. I had narrowed it down to 3 hard drives, but still spent weeks contemplating which would be the best option. In the end, I chose none of those options. One day while doing research, I stumbled upon hdd.userbenchmark.com. This is a fantastic website that shows real-world statistics for a wealth of different hard drives. I was able to compare side-by-side each one of the hard drives that I was considering for my upgrade. Upon chance, I found this Toshiba hard drive on the list. This hard drive currently ranks at #10 on the speed/performance list, and easily out-performs all of the other hard drives I was considering. And the best part? It\'s at least $20 cheaper than all the other drives I was considering!Now on to the hard drive itself. I\'m just your average every day consumer, and I don\'t have much experience in internal hard drives. I learned a great deal about them through all the research I performed before making my purchase. I could not possibly be more satisfied with my purchase. This hard drive has exceeded all of my expectations. After installing the drive (the PS4 software installed much quicker with this hard drive than my previous upgrade drive) I proceeded to install all of my PS4 games from discs. This took not quite half as long as it did than with the other hard drive I originally used to upgrade the PS4. Loading games and game saves is much quicker with this drive, and the actual processing and performance of the drive is a huge improvement as well. With the other drive, there would be stuttering and delays in graphics rendering while playing large open world games such as GTA 5 and Shadow of Mordor. There are no issues like that whatsoever with this drive. This also wasn\'t as much of a concern to me, but this drive is whisper quiet. It also doesn\'t produce as much heat as other 3.5"" 7200 RPM drives do. So that being said, I think placing this drive in the Nyko Data Bank to upgrade the PS4 would be absolutely fine.I will be happy to try and answer any questions regarding the hard drive or my set-up. I absolutely without any reservations recommend this hard drive for an upgrade to the PS4!', '注文後すぐに届き設定も問題なく動作しました。', 'je l\'ai acheté pour son prix ,et considérant que les fabricants de hdd connus sont de qualité approchante.le seul inconvénient c\'est le clic clic lors du déplacement des têtes , même si cela n’enlève rien à la qualité du produit , c\'est un peu gênant tout de même .et bien 28 décembre ce disque est hs , plus reconnu par windows impossible de se connecter . sera renvoyé à l\'expéditeur et surement remplacé , mais il faut savoir que les frais de retour du colis est à nos frais contrairement à amazon .Alors la prochaine fois je choisirai un HDD expédié par amazon , car le tarif est tout de même de 6,56 euros , à bon entendeur ??Dernière nouvelle un nouveau me sera renvoyé.En effet ce jour 10 janvier 2014 reçu un nouveau disque: montage , test ok , à noter que sur ce dernier pas constaté de bruit de déplacement de têtes .

Copied a few image folders to test copy and retrieval. S.M.A.R.T. said ""drive OK."" That was true a week later. I looked at SMART details and found hundreds of millions of read errors and seek errors. Yikes. No bad sectors. Called Seagate to see if this was a transient issue that could be zeroed out--meanwhile S.M.A.R.T. was running an extended test. During the call the errors kept rising. Tech said this sounded like a bad drive and they would replace it. I said it was only 7 days since it arrived and that Amazon would take it back. He agreed that this might be a little faster. Amazon\'s shipment of the replacement is arriving tomorrow and I have a shipping label to put on the package for returning the  current  drive. So good support from Amazon. I learned from the tech that Seagate would call it a DOA if it failed within 90 days and that gives an extra 60 days beyond Amazon\'s return deadline and is fine support also. I didn\'t want this issue and the annualized failure rate is quite low so I\'m expecting better from the replacement.NEW:Whoa. I spent considerable time trying to search online for information about such strange S.M.A.R.T.-test errors as millions of seek errors and millions of read errors and corresponding millions of read hardware error corrections (ECC). I found lots of advice that this was a failing drive and several comments that this was a symptom of changes Seagate made in their drives\' S.M.A.R.T. data system and did NOT mean failing. At the tech support agent\'s suggestion I had downloaded Seagate\'s disk test tools. Unfortunately, the only way to use them in my Linux server was to download the USB-flash bootable version. That in turn unfortunately requires Windows to make the bootable flash drive (Catch 22???). When booted, the flash system runs a tiny version of Linux. (IMO that\'s borderline nonsensical--they should simply make a Linux program that runs under normal Linux OSes so that a reboot of a Windows-created USB drive isn\'t required.) The Seagate Tool on the USB bootable flash drive says simply that the drive ""passes"" the S.M.A.R.T. test. The Linux disk utility goes into a long list of detailed measurements including the millions of errors I mention above.Searching with google I found a longish statement on the Seagate site that says that 3rd party S.M.A.R.T. utilities shouldn\'t be used. Now they tell me. It explains that Seagate has modified how the data from the built-in S.M.A.R.T. utility is different from the more standard disk industry data. Why? Good question. Why didn\'t the tech tell me that? Good question. Why was that statement not intimately tied to the text around their test software? Good question.So, for what I\'d say was flawed communication, an apparently good drive was sent back with lots of errors reported by the standard Linux disk tool program that I\'ve used on dozens of drives for well over a decade. I think that Seagate\'s tool should report more than ""fail / nofail"" and it should be as convenient to use as the Mac and Windows tools. I also think it was a mistake in ""human engineering"" to change the data format from standards used by most other disk manufacturers. They could recreate standard data for S.M.A.R.T. and still store other data as they see fit without reporting on it if they want to hide it.Also, the tech agent could have saved us both the return if he\'d known about Seagate\'s non-standard S.M.A.R.T. data format. Higher visibility notes, warning against using standard S.M.A.R.T. reading software would have been very useful (apparently this warning is important for Windows and Macs also but those users have more convenient access to the Seagate test software). Such notes should be in closer association with their comments on testing the drives and perhaps in the instructions about their testing tools. Anyway, Amazon got me my replacement, it  still shows errors using standard Linux disk management software but it tests ""pass"" with Seagate\'s no-details software. I hope my comments help Seagate and potential Seagate customers.', 'Excellent product', ""Performance and true value considerationsAfter much online research about storage upgrades and considering my current older motherboard, CPU and RAM requirements, I chose this hard drive's performance for running my Windows 7 64-bit Home Premium Operating System.  It's definitely worth spending more on 128 MB cache and 7200 RPM spin therefore future-proofing the PC system with having more storage capacity.Workaround considerations for legacy technologyThe bonus was doing research online to discover Seagate has partnered with Acronis in developing a FREE workaround solution for allowing the large capacity hard drives to break the 2 TB barrier in older systems running a BIOS that only reads the MBR (Master Boot Record) or as my BIOS labels as 'RAID' protocol; unlike newer BIOS systems that use the UEFI protocol, a requirement if you plan on using SDD or SDD-HD hybrid storage.Noise considerationsI read that some owners complained of this hard drive being noisy or loud.  I however did not hear anything out of the ordinary when compared to my older 1-TB drives.  I did have to replace the hard drive once which I blame the re-seller for not beefing up the internal packaging for shipment.  It lasted less than a day and went dead.  Interestingly enough when the drive died, it emitted a soft, faint, steady beeping tone much like a typical BIOS error code beeps on a motherboard when something is missing like RAM, video card or keyboard, etc.  It also was cold to the touch since the platters no longer spun.  Also the first hard drive was noticeably louder when accessing data so the chatter was more evident. When I replaced with the second drive, it was almost unheard. Now that I have a quiet, healthy drive, I have a comparison that may signal a foreseeable dead drive in the near future should the replacement drive create chatter in the future.Cloning an outgrown hard drive considerationsTo be sure that I will not have to replace the second drive anytime soon, I performed a low level format in Windows 7.  It took over 12 hours to format the first half (1.99 TB of 4 TB partitioned on the drive and another 8 hours for the remaining 1.6 TB on the second partition.  I wanted to make sure that every sector was good and it was.  If not I would ship it back for a refund and go elsewhere.  I also cloned the old outgrown C:\\ drive to this one and that took another 4 hours but all in all, it was totally worth it.  Not having to spend a week or two running Windows Updates is very liberating.Thermal considerationsThis drive ran warm under a load outside of my rig for two days of burn-in testing. No fans assisted in cooling while located in a large open area room in my basement with an average room temperature of 68 degrees F and 50% relative humidity.  All I did was prop up the drive where air could vent all around and underneath it to allow radiant heat that it generated to ventilate.  In this condition it consistently ran at 40 degrees C.  Once I placed it inside my full factor tower, it now runs 27 degrees C situated behind a 20 mm fan with no other hard drives immediately stacked above or below in the same hard drive bay.  This hard drive will climb another degree or two when under a heavy load. I think in part of the exterior 20 mm fan on the front side of the drive drawing cool air in, I also have a Corsair H-100 CPU cooler placed directly behind this hard drive which further draws in the air movement flowing over the drive. So having the radiator with a second 20 mm fan behind the drive has to further enhance cooling on the hardest working drive in my tower. In comparison, my two other 1 TB drives that also run 7200 RPMs run 22 and 23 degrees C respectively. Bottom line, more platters means more thermal radiant heat generated.Size considerationsIn terms of dimensions, will the drive is considered a 3.5 bare drive, the length is considerably longer in the drive bay so keep in mind you may have to consider your case's space.  In my case, I had to move my CPU radiator and fan assembly back further over the motherboard to compensate for the added length and cable management for SATA and power on the rear of this drive.Legacy motherboard SATA considerationsI'm running this hard drive with a Semlos PCI Sata Internal Ports Raid Controller Card (4-ports) Sil3114 Chipset and running a simple RAID 1 configuration.  The read/seek times are comparable running a legacy SATA configuration so no complaints.  Once I outgrow this PC in another 5 years this drive will be still running as a backup local storage in a new custom-built unit. Currently I find my boot-ups to be within a few seconds via the RAID card SATA port vs. the motherboard's SATA port.  Plus I also have FULL access to the formatted partitioned 1.99 TB + 1.63 TB drives I created. I have already used 0.62 TB just in Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit and my required software programs to run video post production and digital audio workstation (DAW) for music compositions, recording, sequencing and mixing. So this leaves plenty of remaining space for mandatory software programs and updates (137 TB remaining).A note about qualityI love the fact that Seagate stands behind this hard drive with a five year warranty.  Downtime costs so much more in terms of dollars lost in production revenue and frustration.  You really do get what you pay for."", 'The drive is as described. However, it ships from Singapore and will take 1-2 weeks longer than the estimated delivery time shown in Amazon.', 'may need to buy another one', 'Good: We have been delivering Seagate hard drives to customers for many years. They have been reliable.Insufficient Seagate management:(I\'m hoping to get a reply from Seagate. These are not issues under the control of the seller.)1) Warranty restriction: The Seagate Enterprise Exos ST10000NM0016 10 TB drive delivered was made more than 8 months ago. That means we don\'t get the ""5 year"" warranty, just 4 years 4 months. When checking the warranty using the serial number of the drive on the Seagate web site, we were shown that the warranty begins on the manufacture date, not the delivery date. How do we get the full warranty?Someone else mentioned that you may get NO WARRANTY if the drive was sold to an OEM company first. So you should ALWAYS check the warranty of every Seagate drive you receive.2) Product confusion: I don\'t see any way to get full information about Seagate drives. For example, some Exos drives are around $300, others are more than $1,200. I didn\'t find sufficient explanation. Do the self-encrypting drives actually cost 4 times the price?3) Are the Exos 10 TB drives supported by Intel Rapid Storage Technology RAID 1 drivers? That kind of RAID is supported by the motherboards. If a drive fails, the information on the good drive can be read as normal NTFS. If a RAID adapter card is used, apparently the data is only recoverable using a good RAID adapter card of the same model. That\'s scary. If you don\'t have such a card, your data is lost.4) It is common that technology companies hire ""writers"" who have little or no knowledge of technology, and don\'t want to learn. Such people write a lot of general information about products. For the buyer, developing a full understanding is VERY time-consuming.5) It is possible to get someone at Seagate to answer questions, apparently. To ask a question, it is necessary to give a phone number and email address. However, I wanted an email. Seagate did not answer. Apparently, like banks, Seagate wants no written record. To record a phone call, it is necessary to ask for permission. Even though banks say they are recording the call, they don\'t allow customers to record. Also, if I record a call, I would need to spend time transcribing what I recorded.', 'This is an amazing storage device for important files.  So Small in size!  4TB of storage.  Amazing technology.  Buy this item for safe storage.  No moving parts.  Better than the Cloud by far.  You stay in control of what is yours.', 'This high-quality product supports solid performance almost as good as SSD-based USB3 for large file transfer, with a price-per-TB only 1/5 of SSD.The unit received is actually a Seagate Exos X 16 14TB HDD (ST14000NM001 G) instead of Exos X 14 14TB HDD (ST14000NM001 8). The two sub-series are almost identical except that the former has 9 disks and 16 heads as per the specs and datasheet at Seagate.com, whereas the latter has 8 and 16.The dozen or so disks and disk heads plus 250MB caching translate to higher reliability and much better performance than its counterparts with fewer disks and heads, let alone non-externally-powered internal 2.5” HDDs, or external 2.5” & 3.5” HDDs where one is hard pressed to find any performance specs at all.The measured write speed was about 240 MB/s during large file transfer, comparable to that of (non-NVMe) SSD-based USB3 that tends to overhead quickly after just tens of GB transfer.This standard model is not of SED (Self-Encrypting Disk) type so data security, if required, would rely on software applications such as EFS (Encrypting File System) on Windows Pro, where the on-the-fly encryption can slow down the transfer speed somewhat. However, if the content being copied from is on another HDD of lesser quality (e.g. a read speed of 180 MB/s or lower instead of 240), the end-to-end limiting factor would be the read speed of that disk instead of SED.There was a newer firmware version (FM 3.0) available at Seagate.com for download, more recent than the pre-installed FM 2.0 on the HDD that had a manufacturing date of late Jan 2020.', 'That\'s 12TB of storage cheaper than 2+1TB of SSD. Now of course you don\'t use them for the same purpose but these are really fast hard drives and I use them to store movies and games that don\'t get played often. Game load times are reasonable. Video file seek and load times are excellent. Compared to what I previously had for an ITX build using a 4TB 2.5"" HDD, the performance difference is massive.Buyer beware that in my experience these are louder than your usual 3.5"" drives as they are meant to be used in servers so noise reduction was not part of the design. Also make sure to get the ""X"" series Exos drives (ex. X16 X14 etc) as opposed to the ""E"" series (7E8) - I did some research on this and it looks like the E series are generally worse performing, lower Main Time Between Failures, more power hungry. Can\'t remember for sure but I think some might even be SMR?', 'I have several machines at home and the old hard drives were solid and are still working.  I built a new machine and it has a total of 3 seagate drives in it, 1 PATA and 2 newer SATA drives.  The newer the drive, the smaller and lighter they are.  And because of price competition, the less expensive they are.  And so it goes with life expectancy.  And when a drive dies it is never good.  And both of the SATA drives died on me, after the one year warranty, but nonetheless dead.  The warranty that a manufacturer puts on their product gives one an indication of what they think and know about their product.  This enterprise drive has a 5 year warranty, so that tells one much.  Do your homework and you will see that it also has two bearings, a major improvement, plus a MTBF of over a million hours.  That is many years.  It also has 128 MB buffer.  I ordered it and it came in, but poorly packed.  Amazon needs to learn that bubble wrap is for shock absorption and belongs on all sides of the drive before putting in a box.  It must be a well made drive, in spite of this horrendous packing job.  The drive physically resembles some of the old drives, bigger, heavier, more solid construction.  I installed it in my machine, did a format and partition, and it runs very well.  I am very pleased with the performance of this drive.  So pleased, that when Amazon learns how to properly package it, I will buy another.  I suppose that offering to buy another is  positive sign about how pleased that I am with this drive.  If one values their machine, and actually uses it for work, then the aggravation when a drive dies is far more expensive than the few extra dollars to purchase an enterprise drive such as this over a regular drive.  In my mind, I will only buy enterprise drives in the future.  I build my machines because I select the best quality parts with which to build it.  Machines that are built for the mass market have to compete on price, and for a few dollars more I can build a rock solid machine.  And Enterprise drives are part of this recipe.']"

This cage is open and recessed on the sides, which shouldn't cause a builder any problems, but may be an issue on PC cases with fixed lugs, depending where these lugs are located (I've seen a Youtube video, where the builder took a dremel to his case, removing these lugs for a similar cage).At the point of fitting the unit into my case, I believe I got behind the fan noise issue some purchasers may have experienced. The supplied fan is fitted with two long screws onto the back of a PCB. This PCB has got one, rather large resistor fitted on its surface, near the fan blades. Usually and with the standard fan, it shouldn't be a problem, but if the screws are tightened too much, it is possible for the casing to get too close to the board, thus allowing this resitor to touch the blades and making a heck of a racket. In my case, fitting a 80mm Akasa slimline fan, I had to place a small M3 flat washer between the fan and the board mounts, after which the unit was absolutely silent. Probably not a standard practice to do, but if your're experienced enough building/modifying your own PC, it may be worth trying to loosen the existing fan mount screws a few turns.The box with comes with plenty of mounting materials, to allow fitting of three 3.5 inch SATA drives into the removable trays, but no cables whatsoever."", 'Der ICY Dock MB153SP-B bietet perfekt Platz für 3,5"" sowie 2,5"" Speichermedien (HDD/SSD) durch die vorhandenen Einbaurahmen der zB.

I would then switch the machine off and then on again and usually it would then recognise the drive, but then fail to recognise it the next time again.As a result, I had to uninstall the new hard drive and I sought advice about the cause of the problem, which eventually led to me going to a local computer repair shop and obtaining a jumper. I admit I didn't know anything about jumpers up to this point. I also managed to somehow place the jumper on the wrong two pins (because I wasn't quite sure which way was up and which way was down in order to recognise which were the correct pins to place the jumper on!). This meant that after I reinstalled the new drive, the fault was still there.However, I eventually uninstalled it again and placed the jumper on the correct two pins and then reinstalled it and I'm glad to say that it now appears to be working fine. Hopefully by posting this message, others will save themselves an awful lot of time and hassle by checking beforehand whether or not they also need to obtain a jumper and place it on particular pins for whatever they intend to use it for. I don't know whether or not the jumper usually needs to be fitted, but I know it was definitely needed in order for it to work correctly in the Humax Foxsat-HDR, something to do with the 6Gb/sec speed of the drive, I understand. It would have been quite useful if a jumper was included as standard with the product at the time of purchase, along with some written information."", 'ADs From Reeses Choclate To Toyota & Nissan Full Comercials ~ WD ??????????', 'cheap and fast had drive, good back up storage', ""Not quite sure how the 3 year warranty stands on an item that was made in 2013!

It lives in a cheap\xa0\nUSB2.0 caddy\n\xa0which is not the fastest of interfaces, but can cope well enough with streaming off the video, and only takes a few minutes to load a typical one hour SDTV program.  It seems to be economical on power as it only becomes slightly warm even when in continuous use backing-up from DVR or streaming into the\xa0\nTV\n, and I generally only use a single USB-A to USB-A lead and not the supplied Y lead.My sample measures 9.5mm thick by 70mm wide by 100mm long.  The length measurement includes the bit of connector sticking out.  All the electronics are fully enclosed, and there is nothing to short out on a metal housing.I initialised it as a 'basic drive', and it was then formatted correctly at different times by both an XP and a W7 PC for different requirements either as NTFS or exFAT or old-fashioned but compatible FAT32.  The formatted capacity is 931GB for all of them.  I first 'quick-formatted' it as NTFS when it was temporarily used for more PC data than would fit on a couple of USB sticks, but later reformatted it as FAT32 for the TV programs.  In each case the time taken for a 'quick format' was less than a minute.On my DVR a typical 50minute SD TV program takes approximately 1GB, so if you expected to fill the drive at one session, be prepared for a long wait!  As a 5400rpm drive it is not the fastest, but then I did not expect absolute speed if it was fitted in a USB2.0 caddy.  It does need to use a higher power USB socket, for example while the TV has a 1Amp USB socket dedicated for a hard drive not all USB sockets can supply the full half an Amp.Both the TV and DVR can read and write FAT32, and each only uses one USB-A to USB-A lead to connect to it (meaning that it does not take too much power), and so it has fulfilled the objective of being a Video archive for when the DVR gets too full; it is doing the job it was purchased for, and doing it well."", 'I purchased this item for two reasons: firstly I wanted to expand the internal storage space without causing the console to overheat (thus the identical 5400rpm speed, compared to the stock drive); secondly, I wanted a hard disk that would avoid the visual & audio skipping/ streaming issues seen with many high capacity HDDs on the PS3. Gladly, this drive satisfied on all fronts. If you want to expand/ replace your PS3 hard disk, this is a perfect choice and highly recommended!Also, if you\'re interested in why many drives from many brands (including Western Digital, Toshiba and HGST) cause these skipping issues whilst inside the PS3, please read below...Contrary to popular belief, almost all of the hard disks causing issues with stuttering visuals and audio on the PS3 have one thing in common - very poor write speeds. Many people seem to believe the audio/ visual stuttering is due to ""advanced format"" drives not complying with the (now dated) PS3 interface standards but the reality is much simpler. In the case of all games where stuttering or skipping is prevalent, a background process called ""caching"" is being employed by the game engine. When working as intended, this process involves writing data to the hard disk in advance (in the background), allowing rapid texture and audio streaming when such elements are desired on-screen (and thus caching is typically used to circumvent the incredibly slow reads from the PS3 blu ray drive). However, if the hard disk write speed is poor, the visuals and audio will stutter and skip as the game engine struggles to render with an incomplete cache of data (which the HDD cannot write into fast enough). It is for this reason that 90% of the games presenting stutter issues with caching are amongst the most technically demanding on the console. Examples of games that typically exemplify this issue are: Uncharted 2, LA Noire, God Of War III, Red Dead Redemption and Batman: Arkham City. Due to their high quality textures and audio, these games require a fast read AND write speed from the installed hard disk, irrelevant of whether they are being played from a blu ray disc or entirely from the HDD.  In conclusion: on the PS3, hard disk write speeds are often just as important as read speeds - if you\'re updating your internal storage, pay close attention to the HDD specs (and don\'t go for 7200rpm drives, they\'ll generate too much heat [especially inside a PS3 phat]).', 'Cosa dire, allora non so se effettivamente le immagini cambiano oppure no, ma ad esempio io sto vedendo l\'immagine di un HDD che è nettamente da 3,5"", una mattonella enorme, quindi NON FATE ASSOLUTAMENTE RIFERIMENTO A QUELL\'IMMAGINE se anche voi vedete un mattone nero da 30kg!! Io ho letto il codice prodotto, cioè ST1000LM024 e, quel codice interno Samsung è del seagate momentus spinpoint m8 da 1tb, infatti quello mi è arrivato, perfetto per ps3 e ps4:è un 2,5"" SATA 5400rpm da 1tb ed è spesso il giusto, cioè 9,5mm, come c\'è specificato anche nei dettagli dell\'oggetto, quindi se state pensando: ma perché mi dice che le dimensioni sono quelle poi sulla foto invece compare un palazzo a 10 piani???

Infatti se acquistate una qualsiasi ps3 (che non sia la ultraslim da 12gb che non ce l\'ha per niente ovviamente) qui in italia, troverete al suo interno un seagate esattamente come questo!!

Questo dato probabilmente non è reperibile sul sito della sony, purtroppo, ma lo dico per esperienza personale, è quello che ci si trova, non sono sicuro per gli altri modelli, ma la fat da 60gb e la ultraslim da 500gb hanno questo stesso identico modello di hdd, solo di dimensioni diverse.

There is evidently no significant problem with the heads, if at all, so it\'s looking like there\'s a small area of a platter that\'s defective, which required some use to reveal itself.  Hopefully, that\'s the end of it, though I still find it difficult to fully trust this drive.** UPDATE 1/23/13:I installed the drive on the new Windows 8 machine, wiped it and set it up as a single 2.794TB partition (you must initialize the drive as GPT instead of MBR, folks!  Link to more info is in comments).  There have been no additional bad sectors since #64 weeks ago.  However, this is most likely due to the fact that the drive is now squeaky clean.  So, the next step is to dump massive amounts of data on it (e.g., batch writing video files to numerous folders) and see if it throws more bad sectors (S.M.A.R.T. reallocation).** UPDATE 1/6/13:Sadly, my drive started throwing bad sectors after day 45.  Ininitally, there were 36 bad sectors at once that came out of nowhere, and it stayed at 36 for a good while, but it has been dropping sectors at a rate of about 10 every week since then.By HD Sentinel\'s calculation (default settings), the drive is now at 36% health.  On some boots, HD sentinel shows 6-7% health, with 65k+ sectors being reported as ""weak"" -- a retest clears this and it returns to the previous health.From 100% to 36% health in 2 months is cause for concern.The unit hasn\'t been touched since installation, and the pc is not a LAN machine, so it doesn\'t get moved (i.e., shock is not the cause).Since I needed to build a new pc for another room anyway, I\'ll install Win8 on the new machine\'s SSD, install and wipe this Seagate drive and then run a complete/long sector scan on it and see what happens.I\'ve deducted 2 stars for the alarming bad sector trend and will deduct another star for every 10 additional sectors that go belly up (until I\'m down to 1 star, of course).  I suspect it won\'t take long for that to happen.I\'ll be back to update the continuing saga...Original review follows:________________________I purchased this drive for use with one of my legacy machines (a 2003 P4 3.0c), as I had finally reached the point where the old Seagate 320GB drive was stuffed full and I ran out of things I could afford to delete.  The price/size/performance numbers of this drive are excellent, so I pulled the trigger.~~ The packaging ~~Some reviewers mention inadequate packing.  I believe this generally is only a problem with 3rd party sellers.  I have yet to receive an inadequately/unsafely packaged item which was ""sold and shipped by Amazon"".  I have had problems with dealers who sell through Amazon, however.Stick to the items Amazon itself stocks and you will likely have less of a problem, especially with fragile items like hard drives.My drive shipped with form fitted, soft plastic end cups for support and sealed in the factory anti-static bag -- just what you\'d expect with an OEM drive.  It was double boxed with airbags at one end.It arrived safely and I\'ve had no functional problems with the drive in the 250 hours I\'ve put on it so far, after having run it through my torture test, which includes a great deal of sustained, heavy defrag operations.~~ Quiet and cool ~~The drive is virtually silent when it isn\'t persistently spinning down for power-saving and parking the heads.  I describe how to put an end to this later in the review -- to skip the section on getting the 3TB in Windows XP, look for the ""~~ That most annoying head parking, and how to stop it for good ~~"" section near the bottom of this review.Left fully on (no power-saving), my drive temp reads an average 31°C -- I have a fan in front of my HD cage, but I keep the room this pc is in relatively warm, so YMMV greatly here.  In comparison, my old Seagate 320GB drive reads an average 37°C.My old Seagate drive is still going strong (96% health) after 38,092 hours.I hope this new drive fares as well.~~ First order of business: scan your drive! ~~Some people are having problems with >2GB drives in legacy systems.I\'ll describe how I freed up the full 3TB in XP in a moment, but the first thing you should do before using ANY new mechanical hard drive is perform complete sector and S.M.A.R.T. scans to make sure you have a 100% healthy drive to begin with.So, before you partition and format the drive, you should visit Seagate\'s website support section and download the SeaTools and DiskWizard utilities -- get both Windows and DOS (CD boot) versions of both programs.  Burn the CD boot versions to separate CDs.You may need to change your BIOS settings to boot the CDROM as the first device in order to run these DOS programs.Verify you have a good drive by using SeaTools DOS S.M.A.R.T. and LONG tests.You may be able to get Windows version of SeaTools to cooperate, YMMV.While in SeaTools, you can check the drive information for such things as temperature, power on hours, etc.I have my doubts as to whether the power on hours will tell you whether the drive is actually an unmarked refurb, since the factory could just reset these specs (firmware wipe) and you\'d be none the wiser.  At any rate, it\'s there for the viewing.The latter test takes a LONG time (whoda thunk it from the name, huh?), but you want to be sure you have a good drive, right? Right! So be patient, it\'s worth it.  After you\'re confident you have a perfect drive, you can proceed to setting up the drive for your system.Boot up Windows -- you may need to change your BIOS boot order, YMMV.~~ The 2TB limit ~~Seagate\'s website support section offers plenty of material regarding >2TB with Windows XP, but for those still having trouble, here\'s how I freed up the full 3TB and cloned my multi-boot 320GB onto this new drive:1. Go into XP\'s Administrative Tools>Computer Management>Disk Management and format the unallocated 2TB drive (I chose NTFS).  This step is necessary if DiskWizard cloning function in Windows doesn\'t work for you (as it didn\'t for me) -- and the DOS version doesn\'t format in NTFS.You\'ll only have access to the first 2TB for now, because XP (32-bit at least) doesn\'t recognize >2TB.  Do not partition this 2TB yet, especially if you want to clone your old drive onto the new drive.2. Shut down Windows, Boot DiskWizard CD (change BIOS boot order, if necessary) and use the Extended Capacity Manager.  This effectively creates a separate hard drive, which will end up showing about 750GB available after formatting.  You may be able to use the Windows version of DiskWizard\'s Extended Capacity Manager, but my XP SP3 didn\'t cooperate until I had set everything up using the DOS version, YMMV.3. After confirming you now have a 2TB (≈1.97 available) drive and an ≈750GB drive, you can proceed to clone your old drive (or format the Extended drive if you wish; this won\'t matter unless you\'re cloning a >2TB drive).  The Windows version of DiskWizard\'s clone function refused to work for me, YMMV.  If it doesn\'t work for you, you\'ll need to use the DOS CD bootable version.I used manual mode because I wanted a larger c:\\ multi-boot partition than my old drive had, but you can use automatic (exact copy) mode if you\'re squeamish about these things.What you need to remember about cloning is that it duplicates EXACTLY, sector by sector.  If your old drive is heavily fragmented (like mine was, due to my lack of diligence) and you don\'t have enough free space on your old drive to defrag it (like I didn\'t), your brand new drive will be fragmented in the same way as your old drive (the horror!).So, I cloned my 320GB onto the largest (2TB) portion of this new drive and defragged the new drive after the fact.  Then, not wanting to delete most of my original/backup drive in case something horrible happened to my new drive due to Murphy\'s Law, I merely cleaned up my old drive enough to give me >15% free space (e.g., I deleted XP) and defragged what was left on it, leaving me with nicely defragged drives.I know, not ideal, but as I said earlier, I had run out of things I could do without on the old drive and thus could not defrag it prior to cloning, which is something you SHOULD obviously do if you have sufficient free space for the task.Yes, I could have made tons of backup DVD\'s to obtain enough free space for defrag operations, but the above method worked, probably about as quickly, and it saved my DVD blanks.Cloning takes a long time (in my case on this legacy machine it took about 1.5 hours for 320GB), so grab a snack, go watch a movie, etc.4. Having freed the last TB of your new drive, you can go into Administrative Tools>Computer Management>Disk Management to confirm the drives are all present and you can format this last TB to your liking.  The last TB will appear as a separate physical drive.  While in Disk Management, you can change the drive letters and names as desired (you cannot change the physical drive NUMBERS in Disk Management).Performing the above left me with 3 ""physical"" drives:  This new drive with 2 partitions, the original 320GB drive and the last TB of the new drive.~~ That most annoying head parking, and how to stop it for good ~~That scraping noise you\'re hearing is NOT A DEFECT!  Please do not send this drive back based on this noise -- doing so only leads to the marketplace being swamped with refurbs because there was nothing wrong with the drives!The noise is a result of Seagate\'s power saving design, which spins down the drive to a slower platter speed and parks the heads during periods of inactivity.A huge problem with this concept is that Windows, at least XP, won\'t leave the drive alone long enough to make parking viable, as it\'s accessing the hard drive frequently, even when the user is doing nothing on the pc and all TSR programs are closed!  Thus, this parking/scraping noise is very frequent in some cases (average interval was 30 seconds in my case).This is the only noise I\'ve heard coming from this drive, and it was as bad as if not worse than fingernails on a chalkboard (the horror, part II!).  I even resorted to creating a script which would frequently read a bit from the drive in order to keep it constantly active.If I had not gotten rid of this annoyance, I would have returned a 100% healthy drive for this reason alone.  Are you listening, Seagate??Fortunately, you CAN stop this irritating behavior, at least with certain firmware versions.  The drive I was sent was made in Thailand, dated 08/12 with firmware version CC43.Now, the good stuff (at last).Download Hard Disk Sentinel (hdsentinel dot com).In addition to providing you with more info than you ever wanted to know about your drives, the trial version will let you change the APM (Advanced Power Management) setting for this drive (with CC43 firmware at least; YMMV with other versions, but they should also allow it).Not wanting to completely do away with all power savings, I tinkered for a while and discovered that an APM level of 128 stops the parking/spin down noise.  Levels lower than 128 do not stop the noise, they progressively increase the spin down level, which in turn increases the time it takes for the drive to spin up to normal platter speed; you can hear this as you set the level to lower and lower numbers.Levels higher than 128 also stop the noise, but they result in progressively less power savings.Imagine that, if only Seagate had shipped this drive at default level 128 instead of the 125 it shipped with, few people would be complaining about this issue!~~ Final verdict ~~This is a highly recommendable, virtually silent drive with plenty of storage space and excellent price-size-performance numbers.Speaking of numbers, compare this drive to the much revered and coveted WD Black:Seagate 3TB (ST3000DM001): max sustained 210MB/sWD Black 2TB (WD2002FAEX): max sustained 138MB/sSeagate 3TB: latency 4.16msWD Black 2TB: latency 4.20msSeagate 3TB: seek time read <8.5ms, write <9.5msWD Black 2TB: seek time ?? (not available, on their website anyway)Seagate 3TB: 24dB idle, 26dB operatingWD Black 2TB: 29dB idle, 30dB seek mode 3, 34dB performance seek (mode 0)Seagate 3TB: operating 8W, idle 5.4W, standby & sleep .75WWD Black 2TB: operating (read/write) 10.7W, idle 8.2W, standby & sleep 1.3WReliability/integrity specs are identical.  The only thing the WD Black has going for it is its additional 3 years of warranty coverage -- no, that\'s not a typo; I ran a warranty check on my new Seagate 3TB and it came back as 2 years, not 1.Better performance with 1TB more storage than the largest WD Black.  My previous experience with Seagate, combined with the above comparison sold me again on Seagate.Seagate just needs to tweak their APM a bit to prevent unnecessary returns and bad feelings about Seagate ""green"" insistence (yes, I know other manufacturers also use APM).  I should deduct a star due to the effort the end user must go to in order to quiet the annoying APM noise, but I feel the above positive aspects make up for this.', 'its works, but it was not initialized when i first plugged into the pc. thought it was defective at first, but it showed up in diskpart, ended up having to format and assign it a letter in disk manager.', ""In a Linux machine, been on line 24/7 for almost  a year (11 months).

It is cheap!Sale price I have seen personally on Amazon ($89/$99/$109) elsewhere I have seen it for $119. All of these are great price per value if you catch the sale.Detail review:These drives to not have TLER (built-in time-error recovery). TLER is usually available on enterprise drives which are far more expensive than these model/similar type drives. That said, there is no reason why you should not consider this drive model or any non-enterprise type for any home built system/NAS/Server/Raid setup. I have two custom-built servers; A Raid-5 NAS (Five 2TB Green WD drives) and a backup server where I used twelve of these 3TB seagate drives for my backup server in Raid-6.Regardless of what other reviews will say, the only reason you should consider enterprise drive is if you really have a business or corporation to have this extra layer of redundancy in place or if you have the money for these type of drives. But if you are trying to save a buck and are on the ledge of if I should buy an enterprise drive or not? ... go for the non-enterprise-drives. For home usage, non-enterprise drives will work just as well with the same performance. Don't read into the hype you need raid specific drives. Unless you are a DBA managing tons of data you do not need it. Yes, drives do fail but no less than an enterprise drive.I got twelve of these drives from Amazon for the price of $99.00/$109.00. The drives went down to $89.00 during the lightening sale but I missed out on that. The price/value is worth it... so shop around when there is a sale. At the time, Amazon limited one drive sale per account. I called in some favors from a few friends to order the drive for me as a gift. If needed, I can return the item in the case of DOA. This is the best way to take advantage of the one item per account bind limitation sale.All drives of all brands has the potential to fail or DOA regardless of where they are made. Anyone says different have no idea what they are talking about. These are sensitive hardware with precision moving parts... you would be surprised how items are bounced around during shipments. You really can't blame all DOA's on shipping but its something to take into consideration. There is also user fault for failed drives as well as many other viable reasons. Of the 40+ drives I have ordered across 2 decades from multiple brands I never had one failed. Does this means or verify anything? No! but maybe people should not get too worked up about failed drives. RMA the drives for a free replacement in most cases. You must not have done something correctly if you cannot RMA for a replacement drive. Annoyed that you have to RMA a drive because it was DOA or failed?  ....Knowing the nature of drives or any equipment for that matter there is the potential it can be DOA ...and if the thought never came up that the item could be DOA/defective? you are delusional and should not pretend you know what you are talking about.These drives and my other branded drives are working 24/7 without breaking a sweat. The random  reads and write speeds are 112MB/sec for Raid 6. This is without any sort of tweaking... just a straight raid-6 setup without any SSD cache. For the raid 5 setup I am using software raid. For the 12-drive array I am using an Adaptec 16-port raid controller. Some tweaking it will be easy to bump up the random reads and writes.For those that complain they are seeing less space on drives when installed: All drives will have less usable space than advertised. For example, without going into too much detail a 3TB once installed will grant you just over 2.7 TB of usable space. Also be sure your Mobo can support/see larger drives over 2TB.""]"

I also discuss using this hard drive to expand the recording capacity of a DirecTV receiver.There really isn\'t too much to say about a hard drive, as long as it works.  In spite of that, I\'ll try to say a few things about this one.First, it works.  Also, it\'s quiet.  The one I have running continuously with my DirecTV receiver is slightly, but only slightly, louder than an electric wall clock.  And I don\'t mean the kind that ticks; I mean the kind that has a sweep second hand and just whirrs softly.I used the NexStar 3 external drive enclosure by Vantec with this drive to expand the recording capacity of my DirecTV receiver.  The USB or eSATA connection between the external hard drive and the computer (or receiver) is usually the limiting factor in data transfer, so this 7200 rpm drive is probably faster than I need.I expect that the packaging varies dramatically from order to order and mine was mediocre.  The drive itself was in its own box, held in place by two plastic supports.  That box was inside the larger Amazon shipping box and was cushioned with the plastic pillows that Amazon likes to use.  I don\'t care much for this packaging.  In my case, everything survived okay, but it\'s possible for the package to take a blow which would pop one or more of the plastic pillows.  Once those pillows are popped, they are useless, and the next blow can ruin the contents.  I would prefer true bubble wrap, or even packaging paper.  As I said, though, I was lucky and everything came through okay.I was a bit concerned with using this SATA III drive in the NexStar 3 enclosure, which claims to accept SATA I and SATA II drives.  As it turns out, the NexStar 3 works fine with this SATA III drive also.I was also concerned that I was getting a drive that was too advanced to couple with my DirecTV receiver, but that proved to be unfounded also.  My receiver is not new and I was afraid it might not work with the ""latest and greatest"" hardware.All in all, I am very happy with the drive.I used this hard drive and an external enclosure to create more storage capacity on my DirecTV receiver.  My DirecTV receiver is a model R22-200.  The ""-200"" part of the model number is insignificant; it indicates where the receiver was manufactured.  According to on-line experts, this upgrade should work with any DirecTV receiver that has an eSATA connector on the back.  Other receivers may not show such a dramatic increase in capacity, however, because they have a larger internal hard drive to begin with.My R22 receiver was originally installed as a standard-definition receiver and had the capacity to record about 200 hours of programming.  DirecTV upgraded it to an HD receiver after I bought an HD television.  (I think the R22 is the only receiver with this upgrade capability.)  HD programs have more data per hour of program so the limited storage space on the receiver\'s internal hard drive was quickly filled with the new HD programs.  It looked like only 35-50 hours of HD programming would fill the original, internal hard drive.  Connecting this 1 TB drive has increased storage capacity dramatically.  Extrapolating from the small amount I have already recorded would result in an estimate of 150-200 hours of recording capacity in HD for the new drive.As stated earlier, I used this drive in a NexStar 3 enclosure.  This one:\nVantec NexStar 3 NST-360SU-BK External Hard Drive Enclosure (Onyx Black)\nInstalling the drive into the enclosure takes about a minute, not counting the time to read the manual that came with the NexStar 3.  I\'m obsessive about reading manuals, but in this case it really wasn\'t necessary.  Hard drive installation consists of:1. Open the enclosure by pulling the end cover (with the tray attached) off the housing.2. Slide the hard drive onto the tray, ensuring that the SATA connection is made.3. Using the (#2 Phillips) screws provided with the NexStar 3, screw the hard drive to the tray.4. Slide the tray, with the hard drive attached, part way back into the housing.5. Attach the connector from the housing to the tray to power the LED indicator on the enclosure.6. Slide the tray completely into the housing, routing the LED power wire to avoid snagging it.7. Attach the tray to the housing with the (#1 Phillips) screws (also supplied with the NexStar 3).It took longer to write these instructions than it did to install the hard drive.To connect an external hard drive to a DirecTV receiver you MUST use an eSATA connection.  You cannot use a USB connector of any kind with a DirecTV receiver.  The NexStar 3 enclosure has both a USB 2.0 and an eSATA connection on the outside of the enclosure.The procedure for connecting this to the receiver is:1. Unplug the receiver from its power source.  (Note: Turning the receiver off without unplugging it probably won\'t work.)2. Attach the eSATA cable from the eSATA connector on the NexStar 3 enclosure to the eSATA connector on the receiver.  An eSATA cable is included with the NexStar 3.3. Attach the NexStar 3 power transformer to an outlet.4. Attach the power cord from the transformer to the NexStar 3.5. Turn the power on to the hard drive by switching the NexStar 3 on.6. Wait several seconds to ensure that the hard drive is spinning at normal speed.7. Plug the DirecTV receiver back in to a power source.8. Wait.  During the wait you can watch the TV as it tells you that the receiver is checking for software, etc.  After 15-30 minutes (for a 1 TB hard drive), you will be able to watch TV.Some Notes:1. It\'s neither required nor desired to format the hard drive prior to attaching it to the DirecTV receiver.  The receiver will format the drive using its own system.2. You will lose access to all programs that were recorded on the receiver before you installed the external hard drive.  The DirecTV receiver can operate off EITHER its own internal hard drive OR the external hard drive that you just installed, BUT NOT BOTH.3. You will also lose all your favorite channel listings and all pre-programmed recording instructions.  If you had the receiver set up to record your favorite programs automatically you will have to program it again for those same programs.  You will also have to rewrite all your favorite channel listings.  This can be daunting.  I recommend that before you connect the external hard drive you write a list of your channel listings and the programs in your Series Manager or To Do List so you can re-create the lists more easily.4. It will take hours before the receiver rebuilds the channel guide.  You will get most of the current programs quickly, but to build a two-week database requires several hours.  Also, the extra information, like the Cast & Crew listings, will not be rebuilt for quite some time.5. You WILL NOT be able to move this hard drive from one receiver to another receiver and play the programs on it.  My understanding is that the programs are encoded so as to be playable only by the same recorder that originally recorded them.6. I have read on-line, but have not verified yet, that your programs and settings that were lost when you installed the new hard drive are not gone for good.  According to sources, you should be able to remove the external hard drive by performing the steps basically in reverse and that this should restore your receiver to its pre-upgrade state.When all is said and done, I am thrilled with the results and the ease of this upgrade.', 'I purchased this harddrive to replace a suspect failing (Hitachi/IBM) harddrive of similar size used for file backup purposes.  This was my first purchase of computer hardware components from Amazon.  The WD Caviar Black HD was ordered from Amazon early Thursday afternoon and was delivered the following afternoon by UPS with no problems or complications. I paid around $20 extra for next day delivery, but the HD was around $10 cheaper than my usual ""egg"" source (those in the \'know\' know who I am referring to).  The HD was well packaged, wrapped in anti-static plastic and suspended by end caps within a sturdy box.  Much better packaging than my usual online ""egg"" source for computer hardware. The HD installed immediately, with no complication or problems.  I have purchased WD mechanical HD products exclusively for the last few years for their reliability.  The Caviar Black product line of WD HDs have a 5-year warranty, and are very reasonably priced when compared to WD\'s entry level product.  I recommend you spend the extra $10-$30 for the Caviar Black high performance line for the 5-year warranty alone.  You should not go wrong with this choice. HOWEVER......The WD HD model I purchased was an OEM version and I knew what I was getting.  For those in the know, this is no problem.  But for those who are new to desktop computer hardware or upgrades, OEM means something important!  You new guys pay close attention!  The directions below are for adding or replacing a secondary hard drive, NOT your primary boot drive.  [If you are new to computer guts and are replacing your boot drive, I highly recommend doing some research first! And backup your data! Or you will be sorry! VERY sorry!]*OEM harddrives ship with NO instructions, NO software, NO cables, NO screws, etc.  Just the harddrive in an anti-static bag.  If you are not prepared for this, I recommend you purchase a \'retail\' version of the harddrive for a few dollars more and you will receive all of the above :).  You can also find instructions on Western Digital\'s support website.  Worth a visit.  Download the FREE diagnostic software too!  You never know....* When you shut down your computer, mount the OEM harddrive in your computer harddrive bay (as a second harddrive in my case), connect the power cable and serial data cable, and reboot the computer, something unexpected may happen.  Your brand new WD HD will not show up on your computer!  Do not panic.  This is normal :)* After rebooting your computer, you will need to \'initialize\' your new harddrive and perform a \'quick format\' on the drive.  This should be a relatively simple procedure but can be daunting for the uninitiated (no pun intended).  New guys have a good reason to be nervous.  You don\'t want to click stuff randomly during this process since you can really mess up your computer!* For Windows 7, go to Control Panel, System and Security, Administrative Tools, Create and Format Hard Drive Partitions, and then Disk Management.  You should see your primary boot drive, all other HDs on your computer, and your brand new WD HD should also be listed.  If you see your new WD HD, you did good hooking it up.  If you don\'t see your new hard drive and/or your boot drive, stop and find help. Something is wrong.  (Don\'t screw with your boot drive or other drives, or you\'ll be sorry! Again, do NOT mess with your boot drive!)  Right-click on your new WD HD and you should be asked to create a simple volume partition.  Select this option and within seconds this should be completed.  I generally select a single partition for the maximum partition size at first (you can always create additional partitions later).  Afterwards, select \'quick format\' and seconds later, this task should be completed.  Back out all the way out, go to \'Computer\' on your Start button and the new WD HD should be present.  During the initialization/quick format procedure you should also have been given the opportunity to enter a name for your new WD HD.  I simply used ""WD Black Caviar 1 TB"".  You may call it whatever you wish!  You can also rename your new HD later by clicking Start, Computer, select your new drive, right click, and select rename and enter a new drive name.  With a single partition, the new WD HD should appear with over 900 MB of disk space and with no files stored.  Go ahead and start transferring your data to the new drive, checking periodically to confirm data is being transferred as you intended.  VOILA!  You\'re done!I have used WD HDs for the last few years at home and at work (I build and upgrade the work PC computers) and they have performed reliably for me. Your results may vary.  The 5-year warranty is a very good selling point for me.  Although I have not had a warranty return with WD, knowing the 5-year warranty is present gives me some comfort.  Five years goes by quickly, guys!Just a note, I personally use SSD hard drives (in a RAID 0 array) for my primary boot harddrive.  SSDs are a bit new (and hence somewhat tricky for the new guys) and take a bit getting used to, but I HIGHLY recommend SSDs for your primary boot drive.  You should explore this new HD technology ASAP.  SSDs are so much faster than mechanical drives, you won\'t believe the performance increase.  After a little research, I suggest your first SSD purchase be a retail package with included data transfer software (one or two companies offer this software as part of their retail package.  This will prove to be extremely helpful!  Good Luck!  If you have any comments on this review (e.g. I forgot something or made a mistake) please add them to help your fellow computer brothers.I have read a few of the reviews for this product which have mentioned the drives suddenly disappearing from their system and refusing to boot.  I have this problem frequently, and it has nothing to do with the drives.  If you use a RAID 0 array as a boot drive, and you update your BIOS, the SATA controller option in BIOS is changed from ""RAID"" to ""AHCI"" for some reason (at least on my ASUS motherboard).  If this does happen, the machine will not boot since it is looking for a single drive in AHCI mode and not the RAID 0 array.  This problem is easily fixed by accessing the BIOS and changing your AHCI setting to the RAID setting, saving the settings (!), and rebooting.  Your system should come up just fine.Ed561', 'There are several things to know about this excellent drive and about Western Digital too:1:  This is one of the best you can buy with possibly the best warrantee out there for any drive made!2:  Yes, it can do the Sata 3 thing, BUT, for some who have not heard it yet, it really will only work in Win 7 or 8 fully.  (To use Win 7 or 8, you will lose the use of most of your already bought and paid for software!)3:  You can use this drive as you would normally use any other drive in any computer with only a Sata 2.4:  If you sign up with Western Digital, and register your product with them for warrantee coverage, you can also get free access to a special version of Acronis Back-up & cloning Software!  I have it, and it works great!  Free from WD.5:  This WD ""Black"" drive is one of the very best made: why I stress this is that I would rather pay $10 more for this very high quality Heavy Server Service Duty drive and NOT have a drive failure than worry about a few bucks!(Update 20Jan2013:  Okay, I just had to try it out on the Sata3 ..... here goes.  I cloned my drive onto another smaller WD drive to save all I had as is.  Then I loaded a new copy of Win 7 Pro I had sitting here unused.  Since it was for fun, and I was not worried about being really useful..... I loaded Win7 Pro-64.What I noticed after it was all done and after a lot of hours of time (including nearly 200 Win7 security and software updates....I think that Win7 has more SUs than XP has accumulated in all these years of OPS.) was how fast it would actually go from off to fully loaded and ready to go: 50% less time at least, and possibly faster.  According to WD it is about 175% of the speed of the normal Sata2 fast speeds.In any attempt to load the machine or make the Sata3 really work, I was a bit ham-strung in that very little actually works in these 64 bit systems in the way of software. I didn\'t want to buy any special software bacause I would not want to keep such a system long term - everything has to be new and specific for the W7-64 compatability.  It was fun to do though.  So if you are a serious gamer this is the way to go possibly!  I had a RAID 5 setup for a number of years with 3 drives of the HP type: this Sata 3 is equal to that or probably even better. RAIDs have not been that impressive over all, and then you have even more to go wrong no matter: for it is 3 or 5(+) hard drives stacked up. With the Sata3 you get raid speed without all the hardware exposure or cost.  Just a personal thought.  I hope this helps.  Gary - update end)Continued....If you lose a drive it is often such a severe loss that it is worth a lot of money & extra effort to prevent.  With the free Acronis WD version software, you can have your clean fully operational system that crashes, up and running in minutes- something that took you a lot of time and money to build and install - and you can protect it so easily now.How?  Get another hard drive, maybe a cheaper WD Blue or Green model for a unused back-up, and clone your entire drive.  IF - highly unlikely with WD - but IF you DO have a hard drive failure, or if some malware or bad software trashes your system completely, you can instantly install the cloned drive and you are back up and running in just a few minutes.  OR - you can take your trashed drive, and just copy the from the back up clone (the one you have sitting there unconnected in your computer case ready to go).  This step alone can remove many tears..... (humor).  You do not have to be a computer whiz-kid to do these things either!  If you can buy and install a hard drive or video card, you can do all of this quickly and easily.  ENJOY!', ""Sorry for the pun, but buyer beware!  The specifications for the WD1002FAEX drive has apparently changed recently.  I ordered one in February 2013, after reading that the drive was backwards compatible with SATA 1 standards, or 1.5 Gbs/per second, as well as SATA 3 (6 Gb/per second).  I knew that was exactly what I wanted; something that would work with the hardware I have now, but would be faster when I eventually upgrade my motherboards and cpu's.  The drive I received was manufactured in November 2012.  Without a jumper installed across pins 5 and 6, the drive was too fast to be recognized by my old motherboard.  After installing the jumper as shown on the drive's label, the drive worked great!  It took care of all of my computer lag problems caused by the old PATA drive I had - no more gaming lags, and other apps also ran smoother.  Computer start-up and program launch times were easily cut in half.Wanting to duplicate this success on a second identical computer, I ordered another a month later in March 2013, using the one-click re-order button in my Amazon history to get another.  The second drive was manufactured in February 2013.  It's label did not include any jumper setting diagram as did the one I received less than a month before (the label now has a QR code on it to access the Western Digital website, which is of no help to me - please, no gimmicks, just put the information back on the label).  I tried it with no jumpers, and it froze the computer as it could not read the drive, as expected.  I installed a jumper as before, and it still did not recognize the drive.  I went to the Western Digital website, and found that the drive now only supports SATA 2 (3 Gbs/second) with a jumper at pin 5 and 6, and SATA 3 (6 Gbs/per second) without jumpers.  [The older version was dubbed WD1002FAEX-00Y9A0, SATA 3 (6 Gb/per second) with SATA 1 compatibility.]Anyway, just my luck - now I have a drive I can't use until I upgrade a mother board and cpu, an additional expense I didn't want right now - or perhaps install a PCI drive interface board as I did years ago when I upgraded to a 100 Mbs/per second drive on my Pentium 1 machine?  [After installing Windows 8 on the first new drive, I found my motherboard manufacturer, Abit, is out-of-business, and that the chipset manufacturer, Via, has no plans for a generic driver to support their old chipset.  Without a proper chip set driver, it in turn won't properly identify my old AGP video card, so I can't install the correct video drivers.  The result is very poor video performance, and I can't even get a proper aspect ratio set, distorting everything out of proportion - alas, a motherboard upgrade seems the way to go.  So far, other than the video problems and some other software issues, I like using W8.  The new drive solved most of my Windows XP woes though, and I'm happy with it for now.]"", ""The drive itself is as other users have reported. It feels solid and has a medium noise level. But since most computer fans are louder that does not matter much. I bought this to replace and upgrade a drive which was failing. The drive arrived quickly. I was a little concerned about the packaging but there seemed to be sufficient gap between the drive and the outer box to allow for bumps. The drive itself was wrapped in a standard anti static plastic bag clingfilmed to a cardboard back which ws wedged inside the Amazon box.Connecting the drive was easy. Then came cloning which was where the easy ended. Not Western Digital's fault. I tried three methods before I found one which worked and made me wish I had done that one first.Based on internet I started with Macrium Reflect Free edition. However that got to 3% and failed due to a read pipe error. Most likely due to a bad sector on the originating disk. I tried all the solutions like CHKDSK before they started to look esoteric. Next came Aometech Aomei backupper. That cloned the disk and was easy to use. But the product was not a bootable hard drive. Although it claimed to be a clone, I don't know what it was. All the files were there but it did not boot.Last, and the one I should have started with was Clonezilla. The site gives a selection of ISO images which should be burned to disk with Imgburn or similar. You can use a USB stick but that was very fiddly. Choose the ISO nearest your machine. Despite the labels it does not matter whether CPU is Intel or AMD.Shove disk into PC. Turn off. Turn on and if necessary interrupt start-up to go to the BIOS and choose boot from CDROM. After that I found clicking OK for all the defaults until I came to the selection for drive-to-drive.  Clonezilla found the faulty sectors and copied everything OK with some alerts and warnings. Turn off PC, remove old drive and new one boots up fine.If this is larger than the old drive and you are using Windows 7, then you need to get access to all the new space. Go to Start - Control Panel - Administrative Tools - Computer Management. Click on storage and then Disk management. You will see at the bottom a map of the new disk. A large are may be black and labelled as unallocated space. Find the user space next to that (not system space, just where your own stuff will be). Right click and choose to expand into the new unallocated space. Use as much as you want. default is the maximum left.There was an hour of resetting various programs to old preferences. But nothing difficult. Google Clonezilla and Lifehacker for a better description from 2010 which worked perfectly."", 'RELIABILITY is the key factor when it comes to data storage. While not failure proof, this drive is the most reliable from the most common 2TB high performance drives. An article by Marc Prieur, published on BeHardware web site, lists hardware return rates during warranty period for return of products sold between April  2011 and October 2011 and returned by April 2012. His breakdown for the return rate of most common 2TB drives is as follows:- 7.53% Seagate Barracuda XT 2 TB SATA 6Gb/s- 5.78% Western Digital RE4-GP 2 TB- 4.53% Hitachi Deskstar 7K3000 2 TB- 3.18% Western Digital Caviar Black 2 TB- 3.07% Western Digital AV-GP 2 TB- 2.55% Seagate Barracuda LP 2 TB- 2.31% Western Digital Caviar Green 2 TB WD20EARX- 2.15% Western Digital Caviar Green 2 TB WD20EARS- 1.80% Samsung SpinPoint F4 EcoGreen 2 TBWhile WD Caviar Black (in the middle of this list) is not a 2TB reliability winner, it is the most reliable high performance 2 TB drive on Marc Prieur\'s list. All drives with lower return rates (bottom half of the list) are slower energy efficient ""green"" drives: the next line down, Seagate Barracuda LP, is a 5900 rpm drive, and all further lines down are notebook-speed 5400 rpm drives.PERFORMANCE. This drive replaced my OEM drive Hitachi HDT721010SLA, which is also a 7200 rpm drive. The average read speed has increased from 90.2 MB/s to 117.7 MB/s, and access time has dropped from 18.7 ms to 11.7 ms. Burst rate, as measured with HD Tune Pro, has increased from 179.5 MB/s to 195.1 MB/s. Quick access time is likely the reason why WD recommends this drive for photo/video editing.LOUDNESS. Indeed, as many people pointed out, this drive creates quite audible clicking sounds, much louder than the Hitachi drive which it replaced. It is not loud at the level of being annoying, but loud enough to notice the difference, and louder than any other hard disk that I work with at home or at work. In fact, it reminded me of clicking from floppy drives from the old times. The sound is the only reason why I did not rate it 5 stars.INSTALLATION. It is a plug-and-play disk with very simple installation process. There are either no instructions included with the disk or they are minimal, but it is very easy to find on the internet how to partition and format a new disk under your operating system (the disk comes not formatted and not partitioned, so one has to go through several steps before it is recognized by the system and one can write on it). Since it is SATA, there are no switches or jumpers on the disk to worry about.  I used an external eSATA/USB enclosure to partition the disk and to move my files to it before physically installing it in my desktop.', 'I own a couple of older Western Digital Black drives -- a 1TB (December 2008) and a 2TB (June 2012).  And just as I\'d hoped when I bought them, they\'ve been rock solid.  The 4TB version takes the helm as Western Digital\'s flagship drive with increased performance and a slight change in the brand name.PROS:- Large capacity- Fast sequential transfer speeds- Reliable- 5 year warrantyCONS:- PricePERFORMANCEI test storage drives with a few different benchmarking utilities, but the one I use most often is CrystalDiskMark.  I got sequential transfer rates of 151.2 MB/s read and 153.4 MB/s write for the WD4001FAEX.  The 2TB Black drive, in comparison, scored 118.8 MB/s read and 116.4 MB/s write.  A pretty sizable increase in performance.  One of the reasons I initially bought the 1TB version of the WD Black was because of its good performance.  I was using it as my boot drive and wanted fast performance for my OS (Windows).  As time passed, I moved away from mechanical drives for my boot drive and began using SSD drives.  But that doesn\'t mean I stopped using mechanical drives altogether.  SSDs are still expensive, compared to standard disk drives, and you can\'t find capacities above 1TB.  I still needed a large data drive for my multimedia files, and I stuck with WD Black drives because of their reliability and 5 year warranty.RELIABILITYMy first WD Black drive, the 1TB version, is just over 4 years old and still going strong.  It\'s been repurposed as a backup drive, connected to an external USB dock, but I\'d have no problems throwing it back into my PC as a boot drive.  If not for my penchant for SSD boot drives, it\'d probably still be my boot drive.  Neither of my WD Black drives have ever given me any problems and I have confidence that the new WD4001FAEX will give me more of the same reliability.  Yes, you can buy the\xa0\nSeagate 3TB Barracuda\n\xa0for much less and get even better performance.  I wouldn\'t fault anyone for doing so.  Personally, I just can\'t get over the measly 1 year warranty on the Barracuda.  The 5 year warranty of the WD Black drives gives me peace of mind, which considering I use the large capacity for data storage (not boot/system), is worth much more to me than eeking out the absolute best performance.  Incidentally, I also use two 2TB Western Digital Green drives in my NAS.CONCLUSIONIn my opinion, Western Digital Black (no longer called, ""Caviar"") drives probably have the best balance of performance and reliability among desktop hard drives.  If you\'re looking for an internal hard disk with strong performance and an excellent reliability record, I highly recommend the WD Black in any capacity.', ""If you're looking for a high-performance WD drive and don't care about power requirements, then this is their best offering. It's faster than the WD Green and obviously better for average users than the specialised Blue or Red. That means it's great for storing files and most games on because it will offer enough performance to speed through those tasks without being wallet-shrivellingly expensive like a high-capacity SSD or a 10,000 RPM HDD.That said, if you're going with the usual SSD-as-boot-drive, HDD-as-slave-drive method, you should be aware that since it powers down if you don't use it for a while, then it will take a second or two to spin back up to speed. This by itself wouldn't be a problem, but for two things:1) It's quite noisy. My old HDD was made by Samsung and since that was the only drive in the computer, it was always powered on and spinning but it couldn't be heard above the whooshing of the fans. If your computer is already noisy this won't be so much of an issue but if you're going for a silent PC then get a solid state drive. That's a no-brainer.2) The spin-up time actually causes some programs to crash. I'm not sure why this is but if I start a program from the SSD that needs to access files on the HDD, the spin-up time is usually enough to cause the program to freeze and require a manual shut-down. 2 times out of ten the freeze is temporary and it will continue after a short pause but mostly it crashes. HOWEVER, this doesn't seem to apply to programs that are installed on the HDD, only ones that need to access data from it. Speedfan is the most obvious example, because it needs the temperature sensor. Another would be GIMP, though strangely not Photoshop. VLC player and iTunes are also not affected.I've only knocked one star off between those two faults, because this is a very quick hard drive and the faults are only minor annoyances that I doubt are exclusive to this drive. There might be faster, more expensive options or more energy efficient drives but I'm really happy with this and would easily buy it again."", ""This is my fifth WD Black hard drive I've bought, the first of the second generation 2TB drives. Overall I am very impressed at the performance and reliability. Fair prices too. I've used them as desktop drives, in arrays, and because they have SMART I've avoided loosing data or down time due to a critical failure.PerformanceThe WD Black are at the upper end of the consumer drives, focusing on performance and reliability, at a higher cost. For the WD Black the performance is very high with fast access times, fast spin rate, high data-throughput, twin processors, and large cache... it's one well tricked out drive.ReliabilityYes, less reliable drives are cheaper but you'll probably be buying a shorter life and be gambling on a critical failure catching you unawares. The WD Black drives are pretty close to being a sure thing because they are more reliable, more predictable, and have a long 5 year warranty.SMART FeatureAll drives have a lifespan and this is where WD SMART technology comes to your rescue. The built in SMART feature monitors and logs what the drive has to cope with - Yes, even reliable drives are prone to slip ups and we never know about it because they cope. Reading the SMART log helps predict the eventual failure and give user time to backup and prevent a critical failure, and means you can get failing drives out earlier making it more likely you can catch a drive while it's still under warranty.RE: Reviews of Pesky DOA DrivesReading consumer drive reviews you'll find about 2.5% to 5% of drives failing within the first 6 months. Heartbreaking when it happens for sure, but it's not bad considering shipping, installation, and application are all out of the manufacturers control for such a sensitive and complex part. There can be any of the handful of reasons for this rate of near-DOA drives but it's just a sad fact of buying drives today. There are ways to combat this happening to you. If they weren't shipped to you in accordance with the manufacturers guidelines (they'll list it on their website) don't accept them. Check the intended application, such as desktop, RAID, temperature ranges, etc. (no point in putting a drive in to fail) and if you'll be using it in a raid controller, NAS, or external case check the drive's compatibility with the respective manufacturer. WD or not, if there is a some sort of a SMART feature you can run a full test on each new drive you buy, to weed out any dud drives, before putting them in service.Don't worry if all that was Greek to you. The bottom line is... the WD Black drives have great performance, features, and are among the most reliable of the consumer drives with a marginal cost premium."", ""I had been having intermittent - but increasing in frequency - problems with my computer.  The HD drive was a Hitachi Deskstar (also known as Deathstar because of their high failure rates).  I got the drive with my machine about 1.5 years ago and was unaware of their reputation.  Eventually, enough problem boots and so on led me to discover the root cause of my problems, the slowly failing Deathstar.The specs of the Hitachi drive were exactly what I wanted, however, so I set about looking for a drive with similar specs to replace the old failing one.  A search through Amazon took me to the WD Caviar Black drive.  The specs were very similar to the Hitachi drive that I was getting rid of and it had generally positive reviews.  I ordered the drive and it arrived with Amazon's customary quick delivery times.I was a little apprehensive about the swap over because the Hitachi was my system disk and, if at all possible, I wanted to keep my machine set up like it already was because I have a lot of programs with quite fussy settings.  Fortunately the machine has a secondary drive and I used the Windows 7 System Image program to create an image of the system drive on the secondary drive after running chkdsk on both drives (as ever, the Deathstar had some new bad sectors).  I then opened my case, disconnected and took out the old drive, replacing it with the new one.  So far so good, everything fitted.  I started my machine and the new drive was recognised.  Booting off a recovery disk, I used the system restore routine to write the image of my old drive on to the new one.  Then I rebooted using the new drive as the system disk.  Success!  The machine started, Windows loaded, it spent a little time automatically configuring drivers and then that was it - perfect.It has now been some time since I installed the Caviar Black and I am impressed.  It runs more quietly than the old drive, has good access rates and chkdsk gives it a completely clean bill of health.  It basically does exactly what I want a hard drive to do.  I don't know if the old Hitachi drive was slower or noisier than it should have been because it was failing but, by comparison, the new WD drive is significantly better.Would I recommend it to other people?  Yes.  So far it has been a good, reliable and reasonably quick HD.Would I recommend a Hitachi Deskstar?  No, definitely not!""]"

Speed differences are negligible and definitely not noticeable outside of benchmarks."", 'I\'m a professional software developer.  Being also a careful shopper, I spent a long time researching hard drives for speed, reliability, and size.  Frankly, it\'s easy to get overwhelmed.  In particular, I became dismayed at the apparent poor reliability of many name-brand drives - often it appeared that up to 1 in 10 drives failed soon after purchase.I suspect Amazon has a problem with disgruntled buyers skewing review results.  I don\'t doubt some drives do fail, but it\'s easy to imagine that these get reported with a much higher frequency than those that don\'t.In any event, I resisted spending more money for a ""more reliable"", ""higher performance"", ""higher capacity"" drive.  The WD Blue 250 GB has been a delight.  It\'s vastly quieter than my old Ultra320 Scsi 1500 rpm drive, and just as fast.

I bought this a few weeks ago to replace a failed drive in my very old twin bay NAS. Since it is so old I really didn't want to spend a ton of money to keep it running. I installed the new drive and it was fully synced after about 14 hours. NAS shows it is functioning normally with no bad sectors.Some reviews have observed that this drive is very loud.

They have great diagnostic tools available for download to verify your drive's integrity upfront and clone your current drive if it's an upgrade or total backup situation. Every manufacturer of hard drives has their duds, that's life when dealing with high tech. As with any upgrade, back up your data first and regularly. If there are any problems WD has easy to use diagnostic tools that can sometimes fix minor issues and spit out RMA codes you can send to WD for replacement for major ones. The nice part is, with WD, the odds are low you'll ever have to worry about it. Drives have motors and sensitive material in them... they vary in wear and tear just like any other high tech devices of the same caliber. But for longevity I've had the best luck with WD. And their prices ain't bad either.

I believe the firmware can be updated by contacting western digital based on some online research, however, it appears to be an involved process and involve getting a dos based utility from WD support.

Actually, the installation manual was not very helpful.I had to use the F2 setup screen to enable the 2nd internal hard drive. It was disabled as a factory default and nothing in the manual nor on WD web site was pointing in that so simple setting problem.BTY, WD web site has only 10 FAQ and the customer support is open only during US business hours, so for me, it is hard, I can do this only after business hours. I am working you know.Once over it, everything went smooth, The initialization phase was surprisingly fast for such large drive (set up as slave).I still give it a good price quality ratio. If I go installing internal stuff, I have to be kind of a geek.', 'The main harddrive in my computer (about 3ish years old. A western digital 250gb SATA drive) was getting full, so I decided to add in a second drive. After shopping around, and reading reviews, I decided to buy the WD5000KSRTL. After installation (which was harrowing. Bios saw the drive just fine, but Windows didn\'t want to start up. Zero fault of the drive, just a Windows XP quirk according to forums I read) I formatted the drive (took maybe half an hour) and then I was up and running.I play alot of games, most of which have been bought from the Steam store. The old drive, having been heavily fragmented, was slowing the load times of my games by a pretty high degree. After installing the new drive, I migrated all of my Steam games over to it (a process that was lightning fast, considering it was 10gb or so worth of games. Everything from Counterstrike to Half-Life 2 and Heroes of Might and Magic) and I\'ve come to the conclusion that this is easily the fastest, and the most silent drive I\'ve ever owned. Honestly if I couldn\'t see the files transferring to the new drive (on the screen) I wouldn\'t have believed that it was actually in operation. This drive would be perfect for a media center computer (though I\'m not using it for that purpose).There is only one oddity, which might not be an oddity at all. When I looked at the model number on the drive, it was WD5000AAKS. If you take away the ""RTL"" from the WD5000KSRTL (RTL meaning retail) you are left with WD5000KS, not WD5000AAKS. Reading a few forums, I think this might be an upgraded version of the WD5000KS, though I cannot independently confirm this. Looking at WD\'s website, the WD5000AAKS seems to be the current model number for this generations 500gb Caviar SATA. A few forums mentioned that the WD5000AAKS is a superior drive, and while I can\'t speak to that, I can honestly say that the performance I\'ve seen from this particular drive has been spectacular.Oh and someone earlier said that this box doesn\'t come with the SATA cable needed to connect this drive to your computer. He is infact half correct. There is no SATA to Molex adaptor included in the box. If you don\'t know what Molex is, it\'s the name for the connector that connects computer hardware to the computers power supply. Recently, alot of power supplies have been shipping with SATA power connectors built in (which was the case for me, I got lucky) but if you are using the power supply that came with your computer (from Dell, HP, Gateway etc) you may need to check and make sure you have a SATA power connector on it before you attempt to buy this drive. Unlike alot of drives, this drive cannot be powered by a Molex connector. You may have to buy a Molex to SATA adaptor if this is the case with your power supply. There is however an included SATA data cable, so you won\'t have to purchase an additional one to install this hard drive (which a few people did unfortunately).If you are looking for a new drive, that is basically silent, at a good price, this is the drive for you.', ""Have less than 1 year old HP desktop which came with two of these drives which I configured in a RAID1 array.

That drive has now failed as well giving it a life span of less than 3 months.  Again the RAID1 array has saved my data (and I back up too!)

It already has a 500GB drive, which I've effectively filled up, which was why I bought this drive...to store some of my extra stuff, but also to act as a backup location for my laptop.Installing the drive was a snap.  Dell set this tower up to accommodate this type of drive.  Just slide it into the HDD1 bay, use the WD SATA cable into one of the slots on the motherboard - just like HDMI, actually - and then give it power.  Its assignment showed up in the BIOS right away.  That's the hardware side.  I left the jumper off (Default), and it's perfoming fine.Next, the software side.  Vista Premium picked up the drivers right away and got them installed.  Next, Disk Management, initialized the disk, then set up the simple partition.

When I found myself downloading music and videos and other things to keep, I realized very soon that my storage space was getting low and I was looking to expand my server. I chose this drive because it was compatible with my server. I now have a whopping 925.25 GB of space. I again will be looking to expand he drive in the near future with two external drives. I usually don\'t buy used drives as a rule of thumb but when I saw the price, I knew that it was the right one for me. I never buy reconditioned or refurbished drives simply because you don\'t really know what you are getting in quality. But, I will consider a ""used or like new"" drive because you can get a better deal. So overall I am very happy with this drive. I did have a bit of problem (at first) installing it but I realized that the process once read by the manual, the process is very easy. Configuring the drive was a pice of cake. Go for WD drive when you are in the market for a new drive. I haven\'t had any problems with drives to speak of.']"

Had 4-5 stars and comparable pricing for its features.It is probably overkill for what I originally wanted (a mount for a HD in a 5.25 bay), but I'm rather happy with it as it leaves room for quick future upgrades. Just installed it yesterday, so this review only covers what I've experience with the installation.  I'll try to give an update on how it is working in a few months.The Good:  Reasonable price for features.  Installation was fairly intuitive and quick (see exceptions below).  3.5 drive fit nicely into the drawer case.  Ample screws provided.  I only needed one to secure the drawer to the bay case.  Provided 7-pin SATA cable (but not a 15-pin SATA power cable).  No extra software needed.  Easy case insert/removal (exception below).  LED indication light works - good indication of whether the drive is getting power.  Fan seems to work well.The Notables:  I was only able to secure the drive with 3 screws - the last hole wasn't aligned right so the  screw would never sit flush with the surface...I just left it out.  In an OPTIPLEX 755, you can replace the original plastic face plate over the installed drawer, but  that makes swapping impossible without removing the face plate first.  The fan is small, but it is slightly more audible than the large computer's internal fan.  Ugh, Keys.  I would have preferred a button/switch.  Yes, you'll need a screwdriver to swap drives.The Tips:You have to turn the key to 'Lock' for the power to be delivered to the drive.  I usually skim directions and look at the diagrams without a problem, but I had to look through the instructions for this.  Would be more intuitive if they labeled it 'Lock & Power' or had a separate 'Power On/Off' button.The last two sentences of the instructions say that the HD will automagically appear, as the drawer is passive and does not require a driver.  Yes, the computer sees it, but you **CANNOT** see the drive under 'My Computer' until you configure the drive.  To do this, right click on 'Computer', click 'Manage', go to 'Storage'>'Disk Management', and setup the drive.  I wish StarTech would have pointed that out for those of us that rarely deal with hardware."", 'hätte ich ihn behalten!Das positive:Der Wechselrahmen ist sehr gut verarbeitet und die HDD lässt sich gut heraus und einlegen. Von daher alles gut, aber der Lüfter ist eine Katastrophe, dieser ist so laut, dass ich den Wechselrahrmen wieder ausgebaut habe und zurückgesendet habe.Wenn der Hersteller hier Abhilfe schafft, würde ich den Rahmen wieder kaufen.', 'I didn\'t expect much from this item because there does not seem to be many products like this on the market. However to my surprise this hard drive 5.25"" drawer is fantastic. Its construction is great, made from mostly aluminum, has a cooling fan, has a usage light and has a lock which turns it off or on.The drawer slides in easily and locks into place with little effort. It\'s pretty good looking too.On the flip side I don\'t like how the hard drive attach to the sliding drawer. With traditional screws, four of them to be exact. It would have been awesome if the drives could lock or clip in place with some easier mechanical method like I\'ve seen on other drive bays. Also the drawer cover is nice, metal and well made  but it should have been provided with some vent holes for the fan cooling.I do recommend this item, I\'ll add the vent holes myself.', ""I ordered a very fat customized Corei7 desktop pc along w/1 Kingwin drive bay and 3 trays. The plan was to install different os' on separate hard drives which can be placed in the trays and booted from. Needless to say the bios on my new system would not detect the drives when connected via the Kingwin bay. It was clear that the issue was w/the drive bay because the drives were detected when connected directly to the motherboard. The support dept did respond to my emails but they were under the impression that the drives needed to be formatted. The drives were formatted and would boot fine when connected directly. I tried this w/several hard drives and only one was detected. I decided to purchase another drive bay in case the previous one was defective but it did the same thing.Reluctantly i decided to give it one last try and purchased the startech mobile rack along w/2 trays. After opening the package, I immediately noticed good workmanship and a solid unit. The unit fit perfectly in my antec case (5.25 in) and the bios detected the drive and booted perfectly. It is invisible to the system and requires no drivers, just as a passive device should.Pros:  Good workmanship and a solid unit  Passive device requires no drivers  LED lights on the unit work well and show drive activity  Fan is not too loud and the aluminum tray is cool to the touch after several hoursCons:  As with similar products from other manufacturers, you have to use a key to lock the unit before it operates."", 'Excellent rack for 3.5HDDs. Since SSD drives are still a bit pricey for large storages, 3.5HDDs are still needed. This rack allows easy mobility to transport the HDD back and forth or to remove it for emergencies while it still keeps the HDD cool and protected inside its drawer, attached to it by 4-6 screws from the bottom of the HDD with an embedded cooler fan in front of it. ATTENTION: The rack comes with a safety feature, it only allows the HDD stored inside its drawer to turn on when the drawer is locked inside the tray by using a physical key. The manual mentions this but it does not highlight it very explicitly, being displayed on a page after the schematics. LOCK THE DRAWER WITH THE HDD INSIDE THE TRAY OR IT WILL NOT TURN ON. I did not pay much attention to this, thought that it was not working and returned it once time by mistake, I was about to return it again when I decided to contact Startech. Their customer service is very responsive and helped me to clarify this. It is a great product totally worth every cent.', 'I have the rugged version- this product is made well and works great. However, it has very limited use cases, as it should absolutely be known before purchasing this that you CAN NOT get additional drawers without buying an entire unit. It comes with a single caddy and it is impossible to purchase additional caddies, which completely goes against the point of hot swap. This may be nice if you want to be able to pop the drive out and take it with you, or if you have numerous bays you want to be able to easily access the drives in. However, if you plan to use one of these in a desktop computer to swap between multiple drives in one bay, the only thing you can do is use a screwdriver and unmount the drive from the caddy, mount the one you want, and then use it, which is not really that much less work than just taking the side off of your PC and doing it the normal way. Nice product if you could just get more caddies but otherwise I cannot recommend.', 'Let me apologize to the writers of the three existing reviews who gave this 5 of 5 stars, for my being the sole complainer. However....I want a bay drive enclosure in which I can just pop the drive in out. This is NOT it. You have to secure your drive with tiny (easily lost) screws to the caddy, and then unscrew them, each and every time you want to switch out HDs. What a nuisance.To solve the problem of ""assembling"" hard drives in and out of one caddy with screws, you can fork over even more money (Oh joy!) to buy additional caddies for each drive, here:\nStarTech.com Hard Drive Caddy for DRW150SATBK 150CADSBK (Black)\nA 40mm front-mounted fan sounds wonderful, but translates into a micro 1½"" in size. Great for baby mice. So what\'s with that? Why can\'t manufacturers give us larger cooling fans on these things? However, I do have to give StarTech credit for plenty of cooling vents in the front and back.In comparison to some other things I\'ve bought, this isn\'t a bad product. For one thing, it\'s well-built, and does what it is designed to do. This is why I still rated it with 4 stars. It\'s just I think that this thing was poorly thought out, and is lacking in features that this kind of product should have.', ""Works well as a hot swap drive bay and the aluminum caddy is well suited for storing drives on a shelf. Unfortunately I can't find where to buy the caddy separately so I have to buy the entire unit each time. Make sure to turn the key lock slowly and gently - the locking mechanism is the weak point but if your careful you can get a long life from the caddy. A bonus is the drive caddy has a small fan to keep the HDD cool. File transfer speeds are the same as my system drives - the unit does not bottle neck during file transfers. Western Digital Black/Gold/Blue drives fit perfectly (have not tried any other models). Best hot swap unit I have found for a desk top PC."", 'I bought two units 1 1/2 years ago and both still work fine.  I just ordered an extra hard drive drawer that arrived today and it also works fine.  I like this product because it appears to pass the SATA data lines straight thru without using a bridge board that may slow down the drive.  I tested my hard drive performance with and without the Startech and the performance was the same.  The product is made of aluminum and plastic and seems to be very sturdy.  When I first installed the hard drive, I left the drive mounting screws a little lose and then inserted it so it would align a little better with the mating connector.  I then removed the drawer and tightened the screws.  This step is probably unnecessary, but my drives  go in smoothly. The little fans  will probably make noise after some months, but they are  easy to remove and replace.

Because of the tight space constraints, and lack of documentation I had to find a drive I was sure would work - and fit!  Most 2.5"" drives available now are SATA, not PATA/IDE.  This is the same model drive that was factory installed.  After some forensic work on the web I was able to come up with an Apple TV disk image, clone the image onto this drive using my MacBook Pro, and bring up the Apple TV.  EIDE is hard to find.  Get \'em while they last!', 'I bought this item to upgrade my custom-built PC and have been very happy with it.  It came with easy-to-follow instructions and software for mounting and formatting the unit.  The price was very reasonable and delivery from Amazon was good. I expected to have problems re-activating my Windows operating system but that went without a hitch. IDE drives have been overtaken by SATA because of technology advances.  I did not want to replace other modules in my computer so this was a perfect choice for me.', ""The computer in which I installed this drive was to be a dedicated music conversion machine. I am using an older motherboard that was in the transition between EIDE and SATA, but I did not want to move to SATA. I ordered this drive based on Western Digital's reputation, and frankly, the limited availability of this type of drive. The Amazon side was as I've regularly experienced: easy to order, received the shipping in a timely fashion, and experienced no difficulties with the product as it arrived.The drive, however, did not turn out as well as the Amazon order. It installed easily, and Windows XP did its formating and installation. Then for some reason, it died. To their credit Western Digital rma'd the drive; and I received a refurbished drive.I purchaced another one identical because I needed it right away and could get it sooner than from Amazon. If it dies soon, I'll let you know; but so far so good.I do not recommend it too highly, but it could have been an abberation with this model."", ""It seems I ordered this in 2008 and never reviewed it. So I'll tell you, it doesn't have as much storage as more modern drives, but it's still running. I use it as my C drive for running Windows and keep my data on newer drives and it works quite well."", 'the harddrive was easy to install; and for the price a good deal! from ordering thru delivery everything well, a nice way to do buisness.', ""it's okay, works"", 'Superb!', 'I have a medium amount of experience doing hardware and software upgrades to a PC.  This was the easiest ""slave"" hard drive I\'ve installed yet.  After the physical install there was a couple of minutes of configuration and that was it.  The documentation was more than adequate.', 'Bought and returned item. Seller stated it was brand new but was partittioned with an older version of windows which would indicate a refurbished item.  The listing states you get a bunch of accessories with it, that is not true.  The only thing you get is the Hard Drive and nothing else.  I did receive a prompt refund from seller', 'Great for laptop.']"

Maxtor themselves will tell you that the faster drive makes a big difference in performance, and can cut some HDD-intensive job times almost in half.  So consider your need carefully when buying this one.The drive comes with everything you need for Windows 9x.  The MaxBlast utility should allow even older computers to see the drive with a special Maxtor driver placed in the boot sector of the drive.  It also comes with a dual IDE cable and installation hardware.Under Windows 2000, however, the install was tricky.  The MaxBlast utility that comes with the drive didn't work properly, and only wanted to create twenty-eight FAT16 partitions.  Web research and a call to Maxtor's helpful technical support number revealed that MaxBlast is incompatible with Windows 2000.  On Maxtor's advice, I performed a low-level format of the drive and flashed my bios and the machine saw the drive properly.  It should be noted that the drive is recognized as approx. 58 GB in Windows, due to differences in the way different industries calculate a gigabyte.The drive has run flawlessly so far.  It is the third Maxtor drive I've owned, and like the others it shows no problems at all.  The drive is excellent for general home use.  I occasionally notice the slower speed on very large file transfers, but it's usually not an issue at all."", 'I\'ve just installed it and works perfectly.

All HDDs were received clean and absolutely brand new as advertised.There was delay in shipment only for few days from the supplier side, but he shipped the HDDs once I contacted him through Amazon. That I won’t really be bothered about. The packing of each HDD was excellent and well protecting the HDD inside. The shipment packing for all the 8 HDD boxes together in one big box is also excellent. All the 8 HDDs arrived my home as good as if I buy them from any store next door. It should be noted that I live far away in middle east where my shipment first went to NYC and then to middle east.I am now using these HDDs with a new QNAP TVS-1282 (i7-6700, 32GB RAM, 450W). It took QNAP nearly a day to check for bad sectors as part of QNAP NAS initial setup. Everything was ok and not a single bad sector found in any HDD. They are set to RAID 10 (similar to my other Seagate HDDs working in another older QNAP for over 5 years with no single issue). So far I have used them for 11 days, and I can say that all of them are performing excellent. No issue, no sound, no vibration, and no heat sign. These HDDs are so fast in both read and write, and streaming 4k movies from QNAP to various TVs, iPhones, and PCs simultaneously is no issue at all.I have been using Seagate HDDs Enterprise models for over 8 years, and they never fail. Really robust. My old ones have been until now working for over 5 years continuous, 24 hours, with no rest. Never failed, never heated, and never behave abnormally. Hopefully these will be the same.Therefore, I always recommend Seagate HDDs, especially the Enterprise ones for PCs and NAS, and mainly (the best of the best) the Enterprise NAS for Business and Home NAS.If you see no further feedback from me in the future, it means they are working perfect.', ""For the time being, I'm giving it this 3 stars. Of the 4 that I bought for my Nas one of them was defective, the drive works but it's making loud clicking and audible thrumming. I had to pull the drive out after my database rebuilt and put back my original. The drive was extremely hot to the touch. I am waiting to hear back from customer support. Other than that, the other 3 drives are great."", 'Ordered Qty SIX of Segate 6TB Enterprise NAS ""st6000vn0001"" two arrived dead on arrival. One it is recognized as 4TB but failes to start, the other one is a jet going for a take off. On the other hand, the other 4 are working fine so far but the fact two arrived dead made me alerted especially I had a very bad experience with Segate 3TB HD 6 out 6 failed in less than 4 months as a result I requested for a refund not a replacementUpdate December 4an other 1 failed 3 days ago hence I decided to return all four since i lost faith in this product.

Until thenPlease stay away of it', 'I purchased this drive and a WD RED PRO for my NAS a year ago. They have both performed flawlessly.
