It holds the a mid tower well. Based on it's sturdiness, I can't believe it handles up to 50lb.It does the job and for a not DIY option, I think it's the best option at the price range.I appreciate the space it leaves for the power supply fan and the distance it keeps the tower from the floor."", ""Nice for the price and nice design, fold it up when you aren't using it.  I had another trolly but it had tall sides on it that blocked at least one of my fans, I like this one because it will not block your fans and it also is more or less open on the bottom so bottom fans should not be blocked either.  Easy to setup the upright things on the end of the arms simply twist into place and there is a wing nut on the bottom to tighten it up should it become loose, it will still move a bit even if the wingnut is tightened all the way down.  I looked a lot before I decided on this one, for the price it's a good deal the max weight is around 40 pounds which should be fine even on a supertower case unless you have tons of crap installed in the case.  This is the best design I've seen for these things, my only request would be a sturdier version using either sturdier plastic or even metal so it would support more weight it could also be a little bit wider back to front but I have no fear of the case tipping off this unit the way it is."", 'I have a new small form factor PC to replace the mid tower I am currently using.  The stand for the mid tower would not go small enough to hold the new computer.  I discovered that almost all stands only adjust down to around 6"".  I was about to give up when I discover this stand which claimed to go down to 3.75"".  My new computer is 4"" wide, so I ordered this unit.  It does in fact hold my 4"" wide PC, but there is one problem, as another reviewer mentioned, if the depth of the computer is less than 15"" then all four pillars will not make contact with the computer.  That being said, the stand seems to work fine for me with just the front pillars holding the computer.  The stand is sturdy, and I do not see any danger of the computer tipping over.  Rolls ok on my laminate flooring.  I would have given 5 stars except for the depth issue.  Good stand...', 'Works out well for me in the end, but it was close! My gaming rig is wider than I thought it was and I was barely able to get the case in place without modifying something.On carpet, medium pile, I really cannot move this easily without the legs wanting to collapse in. Now it cannot collapse far as there is barely enough room for it to go far but it is worth mentioning.Quality of the plastic material is pretty hefty and I believe this will stand the test of time. Overall value is measured for me by what other options were available for the equated money ratio and it was pretty good here.Very good thing to keep your pc off the ground so that the fans do not suck in dirt, debris and other contaminants that will clog the fans.', 'This stand is lightweight and compact in size, and yet capable of expanding in width, to accommodate computer cases of varying sizes. The front wheels lock, to keep your computer securely in place. Being equipped with wheels, this stand can be rolled forward, when necessary, to access the cables at the rear of the computer. Thick and/or plush carpet may, however, pose a problem when rolling this, and other such CPU stands, across a carpeted floor. Importantly, the stand keeps my computer case elevated, up off the floor. Living outside the continental United States the weight, and therefore the shipping cost, of any CPU stand I purchased was a factor in my purchasing decision. Despite the low height profile of this CPU stand, I am quite happy with this product. Being a 3M product, it has been performing well for some years now. This product has met, and continues to meet my needs and expectations.', 'Easy to assemble and easy to move with your computer tower not being compromised.', ""I was leary about ordering this stand from all the negative reviews, but I am happy I went with my gut feeling that a 3M product would be of good quality. This stand most certainly meets all my expectations.The stand raises the CPU 3.5 inches off the floor. If the stand and computer are positioned flush, right next to a wall, the side of the tower ends up being 1.5 inches away from the wall, sufficient for decent air circulation.There is a wing nut on the bottom of the stand to help hold the adjustable side pieces in position, but I found that the sides tended to expand somewhat even with it tightened.  I was afraid to overtighten, so perhaps if I hadn't been chicken, I could have gotten a firmer hold.I have the computer stand sitting on ceramic tile and have been able to move it easily with the sides staying in position.  The four upright side supports are well clad with a non-marring material.  The computer is safely nested.All in all, I feel that this is a well made, reasonably priced computer stand, and I definitely recommend it."", 'The stand is sturdy but CPU slides off the stand very easily when on carpet. You can only roll the computer by pulling or pushing the stand itself. If you try to move the computer case, is simply slides off the stand. The stand has 3"" high padded posts on all 4 corners.  I used a load strap and wrapped it around the outside of all 4 posts with the computer box in the stand, cinched it down snug until the computer no longer slipped off the stand. With it strapped in, it works great.  I suspect it may work on bare floors but if it were me I would put some padding between the computer case bottom and the stand to provide some resistance so the it will not slide out of the stand so easily.', 'The stand works perfectly for our Aurora R9 and R11. They are now mobile, off the ground, and not subject to budging or tipping within the stand. Also, no added setup/build was needed, stand was ready to go right out of the box.']"

This is a fantastic CPU, however there are a few things to know. I did pair this with 6000 CL36 RAM and a MSI B650 Tomahawk board. It ran EXPO with no issues, however the processor was running at a higher clock than factory and was causing some stability issues. To fix this issue I ran the CPU at a negative .15 offset. This brought stability to the system and also increased performance in games and in cinabench R23. Also to note this is a chip that runs hot, but that it is designed to run hot by AMD. To keep it cool I ran a EK 360 AIO and set the package temperature limit to 85 degrees. Even with the negative .15 offset and 85 degrees limit this chip benchmarked higher that most review I have seen for the 7600X. I did attempt a undervolt with PBO and it would not accept any, however with the setting I have previously mentioned this chip ran cool with awesome performance, still exceeding the factory 5.3 boost speeds. After settings were in place it was running games at 50-60c, with no bottlenecks on the 79000XTX at 1440p or 4K.

‎B09VCJ171S,"AMD Ryzen 5 5500 6-Core, 12-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor with Wraith Stealth Cooler, Ceramic Gray",Processors,S$93.55,https://www.amazon.sg/AMD-Ryzen-5500-12-Thread-Processor/dp/B09VCJ171S/ref=sr_1_4?qid=1695818987&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051&rnid=7993546051&s=electronics&sr=1-4,https://www.amazon.sg/AMD-Ryzen-5500-12-Thread-Processor/product-reviews/B09VCJ171S/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,4.7,"[""For me CPUs like this, which are budget CPUs are mostly about the price.  For $100 USD or less this is an excellent buy.  If it's more than that, uhhhh.  I'll take the 5600 for $130 Bob.While this is a Zen 3 CPU, it's not PCIe gen4 and you should be aware of this before buying.  It's not the same line of CPU that most Zen 3 CPUs which are Vermeer.  This is Cezanne.  There are 3 Cezanne CPUs, the other two are OEM only, meaning they only come in a PC you buy from a company that makes PCs like Dell, etc........  For the most part this isn't a problem because it's a budget CPU, however if you pair this with something like an AMD Radeon 6500 XT which only uses 4 PCIe lanes to connect to the CPU, you'll get bad performance.  So don't do that.Otherwise as long as you pair this with at least an 8 PCIe lane GPU it works fine.  You take a tiny hit in GPU performance but not enough to worry about.The bigger hit comes with the NVMe drives, especially in 2023 and going forward.  There are now MANY NVMe disks that are a lot faster than 4GB/s, and to give as simple explanation as I can, a PCIe lane is a serial data line.  The way a PCIe device/bus works is by grouping a certain amount of lanes so that you get the speed of a single PCIe lane times the number of lanes you have.  Any NVMe disk has 4 lanes.  It also means the port you plug it into along with what it connects to (CPU, motherboard chipset) has 4 PCIe lanes that it will connect with.  So, you get 4 PCIe lanes. So now you need to know the data speed for each lane.  For PCIe gen3, the speed of each lane is 1GB/s.  For PCIe gen4 the speed of each lane is 2GB/s.  So, with this CPU, the best you can get is a data transfer rate of 4GB/s to an NVMe disk.  That's it.  The newest disks coming out the end of 2022, and 2023 can hit speeds near 9GB/s.  Now, most data transfers to/from NVMe disks can't run at that speed.  However many disks can run many data transfers faster than 4GB/s, so that means a CPU that runs PCIe gen3 is slowing down modern NVMe disks that can run gen4 or now gen5 speeds.  But that's not a statement that has a clear meaning, because just because a disk is called gen4, it doesn't mean most of the data transfers to/from that disk will run at the full bandwidth of PCIe gen4 x4 lanes = 8GB/s.  Most gen4 disks rarely hit that speed if ever.  Only the most expensive ones do.  BUT once again many will run different types of transfers above 4GB/s.So that's the description of what it means to have PCIe gen3 when dealing with modern NVMe disks.  You're going to slow down some of the data transfers, not all, depending on how fast (which also means more expensive) the disk is.Yes for a general purpose PC build this is good enough and it's a low cost option that's really good at $100 USD or less.  However if the price of this starts to get closer to the Ryzen 5600, I'd rather buy the 5600 because that's PCIe gen4 which is as good as it gets with an AMD AM4 motherboard."", ""This is a great CPU for general use and budget/mid-range gaming! It's able to keep up with all my computing tasks and when gaming with my AMD RX6700XT. Seriously I am very impressed. I will say that when I first installed it, the CPU was running a little warm, but nothing too bad and after a few days it seemed to settle down and now typically sits around 55-65 degrees even while gaming/computing in this hot SoCal summer. I generally see about 20% to 30% usage while playing pretty recent games on 1440p and ultra quality. Would I prefer a 5600x, 5700x or 5800x? Of course, but for the price, nothing beats the value of this CPU and I'm just not willing to spend double the price on relatively limited performance increases. As long as you're not planning to do some extremely CPU-heavy tasks or overclocking, this CPU should fit your needs perfectly. The Wraith Stealth cooler is a nice free add-on as well, although I would suggest if you're looking for ultimate performance, you might want to contemplate a tower air cooler or AIO. However, the Wraith is more than adequate by itself. Anyway, I can't recommend this CPU enough. Keep in mind though, if you're used to Intel CPUs which typically come with integrated graphics, this CPU does not (only G series AMD CPUs like the 5600G for example include integrated graphics although they don't perform as CPUs as well as non G series), so you'll have to buy a graphics card. Also keep in mind X series CPUs like the 5600x are for extreme overclocking (I would go easy on overclocking non-X CPUs and for a lower ranged CPU like this one I would not recommend any overclocking at all). Hope that helps with your decision!

Normally I do not upgrade so soon, I usually upgrade platforms in 4 year increments but the performance gains with 3dvCache in my games were too much to pass up.This CPU excels in strategy games such as games by Paradox Interactive (Europa Universalis IV, Stellaris, etc) and is no slouch with other genres either, FPS, RPG, you-name-it. I was getting terrible lag late game in Stellaris in particular on my 12900k and this 7800x3d made a hugely noticeable difference, with 10,000 pops and a 1,000 star galaxy and hundreds of millions of fleetpower with many mods.Rimworld is another example where this CPU shines. I was trying to conquer the world in one of my Rimworld playthroughs and the late game lag on the 12900k was too much to bear, it killed the run - was unplayable.

No matter how low I put the graphics settings, I could only ever average about 120-130 FPS with very frequent drops to 100-110FPS and some occasional drops to the high 80's and low 90's. This held true even if I used DLSS Performance mode. Zero difference in average FPS.  It felt absolutely terrible to try to push an enemy team at close range with mortar strikes and smoke grenades going off and have a huge FPS drop. Felt equally as bad to stare off at a big cityscape horizon while trying to take long range precision shots and suddenly have to fight system performance.Long story short, I paired the 7800X3D with a Gigabyte x670 Aorus Elite AX motherboard and 32GB of DDR5 6000mhz Corsair Vengeance RAM, and my average FPS has exploded up to 190-210. Jumping out the plane I'm almost always above 200FPS, which is just absurd to me, and I'm frequently in the 210-220 range just running around Al Mazrah. My 1% lows are in the 165-180 range, which I can barely feel.I've tested this CPU as well in BF2042 and The Last of Us Part 1. Basically, I'm never CPU-bound anymore. When I lower my graphics settings, I get a lot of FPS back. That never used to happen. On my 3080ti + i9 10900k setup, it DIDN'T matter how low I dropped the graphics. There was minimal FPS difference between high and medium and even less difference between medium and low, because I was CPU bound.Now that I'm no longer CPU bound, I can drop graphics settings and get a LOT of FPS back or settle on a nice mix of medium & high for a story-driven game like TLOU and still get fantastic FPS with almost zero noticeable drops.Back when I was getting frustrated with WZ2 FPS drops, I had seriously considered that I might need to upgrade my GPU to a 4090 and I've very glad I held off on that decision. 4090 MSRP right now is $1600 without tax and I can't find any on Amazon below $1700. With tax you're looking at a pretty penny, and my FPS issues still would have continued unabated because I'd have been addressing the wrong problem.This CPU + mobo + RAM altogether came out to $972.98 with tax. So I basically saved at least $700 and probably more while massively increasing the performance scaling of the games I play and unlocking the full potential of my watercooled 3080ti.I did have to order an AM5 mounting bracket for my Noctua cooler, but that was only like 7 bucks and it was easy to install.When it comes to CPU's, I can officially be counted as a member of team red. I've been building PC's since 2006 and every single one of them up until now has had an Intel chip in it, but there is no denying the raw performance of 3D v cache in certain games, particularly in the battle royale genre."", ""J'ai toujours été Intel , mais la sur un coup de tete j'ai acheter ce processeur pour mon ordi , il faut bien ce faire une idée propre et pas ce méfier de ce que les autres dissent , ça va faire 1 semaine , et ce processeur ne chauffe pas il est refroidi par un AIO watercooling de chez Be Quiet , presque sur tous les jeux il depasse pas les 65°."", ""Pros:- Gaming performance is unmatched.- AMD finally grows up with the AM5 socket and ditches CPU pins.  This was probably the easiest computer build I've ever done, in part due to this.- Way more power efficient under load than the competition.Cons:- It's cheaper than the top tier, but $449 still isn't cheap, especially for only 8 cores.- Performance for everything besides gaming is, at best, middle of the road.  This is a gaming CPU through and through; if you care about performance for anything else, don't get it.This CPU choice was a bit of a departure for me.  I usually just get the most expensive consumer processor available.  But, with GPU prices and motherboard prices the way they are (this was the first time I've paid more for the motherboard than the CPU), plus the off-the-charts power and thermals for some of the more expensive options, I had to settle for some compromises.  But, one thing I didn't want to compromise on was gaming performance, and with the 7800X3D, I don't have to!"", ""First off, this is an amazing CPU.

I initially paired this with an NZXT N7 650E, and no matter how many different BIOS I tried, or clearing CMOS, or trying RAM setsup... I couldn't get it to post. Thought it was a bad board, and even the 2nd board wouldn't work. Decided to switch to MSI b650 and it posted first try.

You should do it!The value for performance is well worth it!Defintely reccommend.Just make sure you get an appropriate Cooler designed for this CPU; as it does run hot!', ""Star Citizen is only in alpha, but it's a game of massive scope and is heavily CPU-bound. All but the best systems can struggle in some areas of dense geometry and textures, but this CPU is the best considering cost/benefit. The 7800X3D is even better for this game than the 7900 and 7950, but Google it to see why.All told, I did my research and found the best bang for the buck. Plus, AMD was and may still be running a promotion to receive Starfield free with purchase, though AMD has not sent me the code I need to complete the registration process, so there's that. Hopefully they fix this before Starfield releases.If you're a Star Citizen player, this is the CPU you want and should build a system around."", 'I just upgraded from a AM4 build with a Ryzen 9 5900x, 64 gigs of ram running at 3600mt, gigabyte x570 AORUS pro Wi-Fi and asus Strix RTX4090. I knew upgrading to the Ryzen 7800x3d would be a down grade in non game applications and not all games would see a boost. I didn’t want to spend the extra money on the 7950x3d only to have to turn off half the cores to take advantage of the extra cache without having issues in some games if you rely on Microsoft game bar to switch automatically. The 7900x3d has the same issue but your down to 6 cores when gaming to use the extra cache. Mine is running stable and cool running at 4944Mhz at idle and will boost to 5150Mhz for a short time then run 6 or 7 cores at 5150 MHz for as long as needed. Under heavy load the system will run at 79c. When gaming depending the game it will be in upper 50c range to 60c range. I’m using a EK 360 mm AIO to cool the cpu. The primary reason I went AMD AM5 vs intel 13th gen is the heat the system would generate running a Intel 13700 or 13900. My room the computer is in isn’t big and my AM4 system heated the room up pretty good, enough that I need to run ac in the summer to keep the room comfortable. The other plus is the AM5 system has an upgrade path in the future but the current intel socket doesn’t. This CPU does run some newer games that can utilize the extra up to about 20 percent at best which is a big boost but your not going to see huge gains across the board if your on high end AM4 system. Still worth it to me and I’ll be on this platform for a few CPU generations just like with AM4 if you started when it was new.']"

La scritta AMD è molto grande e visibile alle persone con problemi visivi.Il processore è visibile al lato della scatola in tutta la sua MASSA.Aprendolo, avremo una sorpresa: una tecnologia talmente avanzata che risulta essere necessaria assieme al nostro processore: un dissipatore AMD® Wraith™ Stealth, consigliabile per un utilizzo non paragonabile al mio. Tale dissipatore deve sopportare il mio PBO a 105W. (Sono povero) (Amazon Vine pls take me in I need a new CPU cooler thx).Il dissipatore AMD® Wraith™ Stealth risulta essere un discreto prodotto capace di ""dissipare"" il nostro processore in carichi relativamente leggeri come il gaming.

If you are gaming under 144hz and on a budget this is easily one of the best you can get from this generation.This is continually one of, if not the highest, value cpu's as it comes with a very beefy performance for its cost and a cooler all in one package.I had near-flawless performance when used on my 144hz 1440p monitor in most of my games. I generally reduce in-game settings to accommodate higher framerate which does often reduce CPU load as well but reducing max framerates to 120 and more-so 90 at comparable settings would be even more ideal if going for higher settings or a smoother 1% framerate experience for fast games.Productivity - I had two monitors and often I watch videos, streamers, chat with friends and browse(browsers can be quite CPU intensive at times due if not using hardware-encoding which in my case I did not due to compatibility issues with other software)All-in-all if you are building a new system, you may want to look at the newer AMD 7600 lineup as it is very similar, but if squeezing out a smaller budget with a very good sale or a used purchase, the 5600 will last you at minimum 4 years without issue."", ""Le socket AM4 n'a pas encore tiré sa révérence et il reste un très bon choix pour les budgets serrés. Outre le prix du processeur, on économise également sur la carte mère et la mémoire (DDR4).

It was a major bottleneck to my GPU, an RTX 1050ti (soon to be replaced as well). I don’t play any serious games, unless you consider Division 2, WoWs, and Dying Light 2 serious. Regardless, those games suffered some serious chop and at times would freeze requiring me to restart the game.The only hiccup I ran into was of my own making. When trying to update BIOS on my motherboard (ASRock A320m-HDV R4), I didn’t download the correct drivers. After getting this problem fixed, install and booting up with the new CPU wasn’t according to plan. My only complaint is that the box the processor came in wasn’t in the best of shape.']"

It has a video output.', 'Buen producto', 'The i5 11600k is, at the time of this writing, really the best value in CPUs on the market. You have to pay a bunch more to get a couple more cores in an i7, while an i3 is only a bit cheaper for certainly less performance. Meanwhile, Ryzens are just too much extra money for frankly a little less performance. They may have a huge marketing cult, and they are very good processors to be sure, but if you\'re trying to maximize performance for the dollar, the Intel cores still have the edge. The i5 11600K is the strongest performing and most flexible of the gen 11 i5 variants and is plenty good enough for the casual to moderately serious gamer or workstation--especially if you dabble in overclocking, but also even if you don\'t, this is still a little stronger than the 65wtdp locked version.Keep in mind that the unlocked K version i5 is the full performance version and does not include a cooler like the locked i5s usually do. It\'s also rated to dissipate more heat which is surely why intel doesn\'t include one. I think the intel vs. ryzen people do entirely too much hand wringing over architecture and TDP differences between the brands. Guys, stop being silly. The truth is that unlocked intels and ryzens BOTH put out a ton of heat and both need coolers that exceed the rated TDP. For the 11600K I\'d recommend a cooler in the 150w-190w TDP range. I ended up finding a good price on a Be Quiet Shadow Rock 3 which is a very nice air cooler for the i5 and probably overkill unless you\'re playing with overclocking. I\'d also recommend the same for the congruent ryzen, by the way. The inconvenient truth is unlocked intel and ryzen both put out more heat than CPUs ought to be in this day and age and you need to spend some money on cooling any of them. At least with the 5s you can get away with upper mid-grade air cooling and definitely don\'t ""have"" to do water if you don\'t want to, especially if you\'re keeping to a budget.The 11600Ks generally support 3200 ram with no need for ram overclocking which is great, but check the capability of your particular motherboard. This is one of the improvements from 10th gen. I\'m running a couple 16gb sticks of 3200 cl 16-18-18-38 with excellent results and no funny business in the bios.The intel integrated graphics on the 11600K is what you\'d expect. It\'s fine for workstation/business use, can output 4k video content fine, and will get you by for light gaming, but serious gamers will obviously need discrete graphics. You can get the KF version of the 11600 if you don\'t want or need integrated graphics, but depending on the day, it may or may not actually be cheaper than the K.Overall, the i5 11600K really is the current value champion for mid to upper-mid grade PC builds in 2022 to date and will continue to be until the next big price drop on the 12th gen CPUs and motherboards. You get near-i7 performance for less money and you get a bit better than current ryzen 5 also for less money. Match this up with your favorite reasonably robust cooler and a good mid grade motherboard (I like Asus TUF, but you do you) for a really great bang for the buck PC build with some lasting power.', 'Product arrived fast in perfect condition, very happy!', 'para su precio es excelente.. si tu presupuesto  no te alcanza para mucho esta es una buena opción.', 'Muy buen Procesador, hiperRapido.', 'Perfecto.', ""I upgraded from a 10600kf to the 11600k.

The wraith cooler was more than sufficient in most scenarios but due to the summer heat, and more demanding games my CPU temps were going above 80C and causing my room to get hotter and some CPU throttling requiring more tampering with settings and research into curve optimization. Much of my room heat comes from my PC due to it being closed, but it is an older house, a lightly insulated wooden home, with 5 windows, along with a mini-fridge and a bathroom that seems to absorb heat from somewhere. This temp was not ideal for me due to my room often being above 80F and during the heatwaves and AC work done up to 88 or higher in my room.COOLER Pt 2 - To reduce my room heat and reduce CPU thermal throttling I purchased an aftermarket CPU cooler with 6 heat pipes. This dramatically reduced my CPU thermal throttling reducing my average temps by 10-20F which also reduced temps on my GPU. The cooler I bought was around 40-50 bucks so if you are interested that is more than enough to cool this CPU for its lifetime.Curve Optimizer(WARNING!!  this may void your warrant) - When using a curve optimizer with this CPU you will see a sizeable increase in performance and thermal temps. You can use a no-update manual optimizer like PBO2 Tuner or research into making it always optimized with bios settings.  Idle temps get the most benefit from this and second is when performing at medium-high load in my experience. Idle temps were 5-10F reduced and medium-high load temps were in a similar range and sometimes far better due to increased CPU performance as well.This CPU is an incredible value for anyone that is enthusiastic about gaming performance. Be aware that there is a newer generation of x3D cpus but the current dollar-to-dollar value for 7000x3d cpus is not close enough to consider for anyone that does not want a maxed-out expensive system.On sale, the 5800x3d CPU is an absolute NO-BRAINER for gaming, but please be aware you need to buy a cooler, and you may need a bios update PRIOR to installing your CPU if you do not already have an AMD 5000 series CPU.  If the 7000x3d series goes on sale and you are building an entirely new system, you should be aware of RAM costs and Motherboard costs as well as this can be a dramatic price differential for cheaper system builds if you are not careful.', ""AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3DIch hätte es nicht gedacht, aber auch 2023 noch spielt nicht nur die GPU bei der Spiele-Performance eine Rolle.Vorher war bei mir ein Ryzen 5 3600 verbaut.Grafikkarte: RTX 4070 TiRAM: G.Skill 32 GB 3200er DDR4-RAMAuflösung: 1440p, UWQHD (3.440 x 1.440)Nachdem die neue Grafikkarte verbaut war, sollte nun auch eine neue CPU her.Im Desktopbetrieb habe ich gefühlt nur einen geringen Geschwindigkeitsschub (vorher: pfeilschnell, jetzt: pfeilschnell+).Im Gaming-Betrieb kommt es auf das Spiel an... da gibt es Titel, die kaum oder nur etwas schneller laufen, etwa +10%, andere wieder, wo ich über +50% mehr FPS bekomme:Z.B. 120 FPS z.B. bei Horizon Zero Dawn bei 1440p und alles auf max. sind schon ne Hausnummer, wenn man vorher mit dem Ryzen 5 3600 bei 75 FPS war. Hammer!Was mich dabei erstaunte: Die neue CPU führt auch auch dann zu mehr FPS, wenn vorher wie nachher beim Gaming gar keine 100% CPU-Auslastung vorlag, wenn man also eher an eine Grafikkartenlimitierung denken würde.Von der Leistungsaufnahme her ist der Ryzen 7 5800X3D im Desktopbetrieb eher noch sparsamer als die alte CPU vorher, da läuft sie so etwa bei 35 W, das passt.Im Gaming-Betrieb unter Last zieht der 8-Kerner dann natürlich etwas mehr, etwa 100 W, damit etwa 30W mehr als die alte CPU, was aber den Kohl dann auch nicht mehr fett macht, wenn nebendran eine RTX 4070 Ti Strom zieht.Die CPU ist nicht ganz billig, aber ich bin's zufrieden und bereue den Kauf nicht.Auf der AM4-Plattform gibt es für den Gaming-Bereich nichts schnelleres (und wird es höchstwahrscheinlich auch nicht mehr geben).Ich denke allerdings, dass sich sowas (die Grafikkarte auch) nur dann lohnt, wenn man sein System mit höherer Auflösung als Full HD betreiben möchte und wenn man schon ein AM4-Mainboard hat, das man noch eine Weile behalten möchte.Wichtig bei der CPU:Eine performate CPU-Kühlung verbauen, sonst regelt die CPU ab, wenn sie zu heiß wird!Bei mir ist ein Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE verbaut, was prima harmoniert.In dieser Kühler-Leistungsklasse sollte man schon arbeiten.

This makes my platform more stable and extends its life out by at least a couple years, hopefully longer. Overall performance is noticeably better, but in games it's day and night. I play in 1440p widescreen resolution, and the 2600 was struggling a bit. I didn't even realize it was my CPU (thought maybe I had an underperforming GPU) for a while. My frames were acceptable, but only just. Now with the same RX6750XT I was already using, I'm getting smooth framerates across every game I play. I was worried it would run too hot, but using the same cheap aftermarket air cooler I was using on the 2600, temperatures have not been an issue at all.If you can catch this CPU on sale especially, it's basically endgame for the AM4 platform."", ""Star Citizen was stuttering with my 5600x, so I upgraded to the 5800x3D, which helped smooth frames out. You'll want the 5800x3D if your favorite games (especially the simulation ones) are CPU-bound. I've also seen performance improvements with Satisfactory, Factorio, Minecraft, MS Flight Simulator, and Elite Dangerous.Many online tech circles recommend this one due to the 96MB L3 cache, which is the most offered in the entire AM4 lineup. There's also a few more cores and threads than the 5600x, which is beneficial for multitasking. If you wanted to, this could potentially be run with a top-tier GPU like the RTX 4090, although right now I am content with my 6700XT.There's no heatsink/fan assembly included with the 5800x3D. I bought the $50 AIO cooler on Amazon and that works well enough. I wouldn't use the 5600x's stock heatsink on the 5800x3D, due to the higher TDP. It would have resulted in the fan running louder more often, and that's annoying.In terms of price-to-performance, this is probably the best sim-gaming CPU you can get on the AM4 slot.

For video decoding, It does able to hardware decode VP9 and HEVC(H.265) up to 8K, which the old nvidia couldn't. Then again, the 8c/16t 5700G is power enough to decode even the AV1 at 8K by itself. Maybe the VEGA can play popular game at lower resolution, I don't know. But even age old Age of Empire III DE have a hard time doing 30fps@1600p, I didn't bother trying others.

Ecco perché sono entusiasta di condividere la mia esperienza con questo gioiello di tecnologia:Potenza Bruta:Il Ryzen 7 5700G si è dimostrato un vero campione in termini di prestazioni. Con 8 core e 16 thread, offre un'accelerazione incredibile per qualsiasi tipo di compito, che si tratti di gaming, editing multimediale o multitasking intenso. Le applicazioni pesanti vengono gestite senza alcun problema, garantendo una fluidità senza compromessi.Grafica Integrata Impressionante:La GPU Vega integrata è una sorpresa molto gradita. Anche senza una scheda grafica discreta, ho potuto godere di un'esperienza di gioco straordinaria. Giochi meno esigenti possono essere eseguiti a dettagli elevati senza alcun problema. Questo lo rende una scelta perfetta per costruzioni di sistemi compatti o per coloro che desiderano risparmiare sul costo di una GPU dedicata.Efficienza Energetica:Sono rimasto sorpreso dalla gestione dell'energia di questo processore.

Il lato migliore è dato dal fatto che ha una GPU integrata (Radeon Vega) in grado di offrire un adeguato framerate anche ad alte risoluzioni con livelli di dettaglio medio. In più la presenza di una architettura 8 core /16 thread ne consente un suo utilizzo anche per supportare carichi di lavoro pesanti.Stiamo parlando quindi di un processore di fascia medio-alta pensato per configurazioni office con heavy workload, media center o gaming di fascia bassa (se usato con la GPU integrata, medio-alta se usato per supportare una GPU dedicata)Io personalmente ho acquistato questa APU per realizzare una postazione di lavoro tipo ""workstation"" dove sfrutto la potenza del processore per far girare qualche machina virtuale per la generazione/gestione di servizi home (quindi con un po\' di disco e tanta RAM).

While the On-Board graphics is powerful enough to do light gaming and basic office work It's only a Radeon Graphics APU, Meaning anything released in the last 15 years is probably outside of it's capabilities  with exception to some online games (Runescape, League of Legends, ect). That's not really why you would want to buy this for a gaming computer, You could have a processor with more raw power and more L2/L3 Cache that would definitely do better, but... having onboard graphics is sort of like a spare tire. When a GPU inevitably breaks it's nice to be able to hop along and still use your computer until you get a replacement. It's for this reason I bought this processor, my GPU may break & I may or may not be able to buy another graphics card based on current prices (Things have gotten crazy on the GPU market.... most people can't afford mid-range GPU's anymore) I love my computer but I'm not that wealthy, having onboard graphics as a spare tire is infinitely more valuable than 5% increase in performance, Don't let that fool you though this APU is a powerhouse of AM4 Architecture and compared to my 2700x It's really fast, with higher turbo frequencies and a much lower TDP, It can still be overclocked (granted voiding your warranty in the process) for when you want to squeeze even more juice out of it.

It is really fast at rendering and got a Cinebench score of 14254! I did enable the Precision Boost Overdrive in the BIOS.Things you should know is,make sure you properly cool this CPU, I bought the new Aorus Liquid Cooler 360 and it couldn’t cool down my temperatures at full CPU load of 95c, and resulted in lower Cinebench scores of around 13400-13700.However, I switched to a Noctua air cooler “NH-U14S TR4-SP3”, and replaced the fan it came with, with a 120mm fan “NF-A12x25” for better RPM. Overall, idle temps and full load were much better! 36c-39c idle, 84c-85c full load and much quieter than the Aorus Liquid cooler 360.Finally, I am happy with this CPU and it serves me well.Quick Note: just make sure you know what you are doing if you decide to enable Precision Boost Overdrive. Read and look up information and tutorials. and don’t mess with anything if you don’t know much.Update on a 5 star review:Unfortunately, I have to knock down 2 stars because as a 3D artist, Maya user, whenever I try to unfold some pieces of my UV\'s, I get a ""// Error: Unfold3D process error."" , which some users have experienced with Ryzen CPU\'s if you look in the Maya forums the same mesh works with Intel rigs and functions properly. Personally, I never had a problem unfolding UV\'s with my Intel rig until in Maya 2019-2020, only when I bought my new 3960X, which is a nightmare with UV unfolding because you have to cut the UV\'s in places that are very undesirable in order to unfold your UV\'s and then I have to reattach them manually in the right places.I know Intel\'s prices for the Intel - Core i9-10980XE 18-core may be high, but if you want to avoid software issues, I would definitely go Intel because recently as 02/24/2020 AMD has had many driver issues with their GPU\'s and the Ryzen Master App is super buggy, sometimes it loads and sometimes it doesn\'t and I get an ""error hence aborting"". Literally, I have to click on the Ryzen Master App sometimes up to 5 times in order to bypass the error to load up the app. AMD\'s hardware is impressive, but without proper functioning software it will still be behind Intel.Final thoughts:I would not recommend buying this CPU if you are a Maya user, AMD\'s software is too buggy and unreliable and this is the first and last time I will buy AMD. Sorry AMD, I gave you a chance and you failed me big time, I trusted you and these type of issues are not acceptable. Maya is an industry standard, and AMD should\'ve invested more time into these types of issues because you cannot render your mesh without UV unwrapping and texturing it first, so fast renders don\'t mean a thing if my Ryzen CPU has issues UV unfolding my UV\'s. UV unfolding was such a headache because it made a simple thing into a nightmare.', ""I was debating between this and the 36 core model, and I'm glad I went with this one.

I can render something, and continue using my computer as if nothing is going on in the background, and that is incredible.My plan is to use this smaller core build, and then as Adobe steps up their game, and windows steps up their processor utilization game, then I'll upgrade to the larger core and not need to replace any other components.-"", 'If you want a CPU that supports 256GB of RAM as QUAD channel (not dual) and has PCIE lanes in abundance, then this is a CPU for you.This is one of the very last CPUs that is affordable with these specifications.I do finite element analysis FEA.

Hoping this CPU will last me just as long."", ""I won't go into much technical detail here since there's people a lot smarter than myself who can get into the nitty gritty. Generally speaking though - this CPU absolutely smokes, especially for the price. Don't let the 'i5' name fool you. The i5-13600K (and KF) is a top-class processor that for most users, will offer more than enough performance for intensive tasks while having probably the most reasonable power consumption and cooling requirements of the top-three 13th generation Intel processors.I came from an i7-5960X - still a solid processor in this day and age but unfortunately my motherboard wasn't exactly kind to me attempting to take it above 3.8 GHz. Despite it bottlenecking against my 2080 Ti, it still ran cool under a 360mm CLC, topping out at no more than 51 degrees C gaming (GPU load) and 60 degrees under full CPU loads. But since the current market for new components is pretty good, I opted to go all in on a 13th gen build rather than find a better X99 motherboard.Odds are, you're probably going to be cross shopping the i5-13600K with the i7-13700K and the i9-13900K. Unless your workflow necessitates the additional core count or you're chasing records, the performance difference between those CPUs and the 13600K did not seem worth the hundreds of dollars of additional cost and the massive increase in peak power consumption. Power also equals heat, and that was another motivating factor for going with the 13600K, having been accustomed to a relatively cool and quiet build for some time. That said; with the additional cores and much higher boost frequency, I was expecting higher peak power draw and temps despite a lower TDP on paper.And they were definitely higher, under the same 360mm CLC. After running benchmarks with Cinebench and 3DMark, I was hitting peak temps in the mid-to-high 70s under full CPU loads. Gaming loads however were definitely more manageable though, sitting in the 40s and seldom breaking 50 degrees, which was actually a small but appreciable improvement over the 5960X. I'd advise at minimum a high quality air cooler or a 240mm CLC for this processor.The out of the box performance is something else though. I managed to hit 23345 on a multi-core Cinebench test and a 16459 combined score on 3DMark Time Spy. Again, this is stock clocks paired with an overclocked 2080 Ti and 32GB of DDR5 at 5600 MHz. At 3440 x 1440 and 144Hz, games run like butter. I could dabble in overclocking it since I have the headroom but honestly, I don't see the point.

Mio fratello aveva necessità di utilizzare un computer, e immaginando la tristezza di vederlo con un portatile, un preassemblato o ancora peggio con un Mac, ho pensato di costruirgli un computerino su misura. E comunque, quale modo migliore di convertire qualcuno al PC Gaming se non con un computer assemblato con tanto amore fraterno?Ho deciso quindi di scegliere questo processore perché trattandosi di una build sostanzialmente da utilizzo scolastico + gaming, e con un budget relativamente limitato (ok l\'amore fraterno e tutto ma non esageriamo), mi sembrava il miglior compromesso tra prestazioni e qualità. Alla fine il venditore mi ha spedito il 12400F, ma io volevo il 12400, quindi ho fatto il reso, e ho comprato il 12500 che comunque è identico a parte la GPU integrata e frequenze un pelino più alte, quindi lo posso recensire lo stesso visto che sostanzialmente sono lo stesso processore.Si tratta di un processore da 6 core e 12 thread, che non ha i fantomatici E-cores delle serie più costose (per sempio, il 12600 ha 6P-Core come questo più 4E-Core che aiutano nelle operazioni in background, specialmente se usate Windows 11), a una frequenza di 2.5 Ghz con un boost fino a 4.4Ghz se le temperature, il workload, e la vostra scheda madre lo permettono.Un processore di questo tipo eccelle nel gaming, ma non fa schifo neanche nelle operazioni più complicate, infatti questo processore si comporta benissimo anche nel video editing con Adobe Premiere.L\'ho abbinato a una RTX3060 12G della Gigabyte e a 32Gb di DDR4 a 3200Mhz, il tutto su una Asus B660M-A Prime.PERFORMANCE E TEMPERATURECome dicevo prima, si tratta di un processore di fascia media particolarmente portato per il gaming, ma che gestisce senza intoppi anche le operazioni più ""professionali"". L\'architettura di questi processori Intel di dodicesima generazione, dopo un\'undicesima generazione abbastanza deludente, è eccellente.Senza dare i numeri con benchmark e altre cose poco comprensibili, vi posso dire che nel gaming si comporta allo stesso livello del buon vecchio Ryzen 5 5600X, senza dubbio il miglior processore di fascia media assieme a questo. Non credo avrete problemi in gaming o produttività utilizzando questo processore, ammesso che il resto dell\'hardware sia all\'altezza.Io lo utilizzo con delle banali DDR4 a 3200Mhz, quindi come performance siamo simili al 5600X che avevo su una mia build dell\'anno scorso, se invece lo abbinate a delle DDR5 un po\' serie può sicuramente superarlo anche se di poco.In ogni caso, nel gaming si comporta benissimo, specialmente se abbinato ad una GPU un po\' seria (come la mia RTX3060). Non ho notato colli di bottiglia, specialmente nel caso di questa build, che sarà usata con un monitor ""solo"" 1080p.Per quanto riguarda le temperature, si tratta di una CPU abbastanza tranquilla con un TDP di solo 65W. Al momento non ho un dissipatore, perché non mi è arrivato, quindi sto usando il dissipatore stock incluso nella confezione. Mi aspettavo facesse pena, invece è decisamente accettabile. Le temperature non superano i 70C in gaming, anche con giochi pesanti, mentre invece sfruttandola al massimo con un Cinebench, non supera gli 80C, che è accettabile e ampiamente sotto la soglia di throttling di 100C. Anche il rumore della ventolina originale è abbastanza contenuto, quindi boh, magari lo tengo con il dissipatore stock. Sicuramente comunque il mio case, un NZXT con 4 ventole aggiuntive, aiuta non poco, oltre a questo non mi fidavo del velo di pasta termica preapplicata, e ci ho messo la mia fidata Gelid GC Extreme, perché per un processore da 65W con il dissi stock sicuramente è necessaria una pasta termica di livello Extreme.VERSIONE F O NON F? TRAY O BOX? GPU INTEGRATA?La differenza tra le due versioni sta nella disponibilità della GPU integrata. La versione F non la include, e generalmente costa un po\' meno. A seconda della differenza di prezzo, valutate se prendere una o l\'altra. Io non sono un fan delle GPU integrate Intel e cerco sempre quando possibile di abbinare una GPU dedicata, anche se scarsissima. In questo caso ho la RTX3060 che è una buona scheda da gaming, quindi perché ho voluto prendere il processore con la GPU integrata? Perché con certi programmi che supportano la tecnologia Intel Quicksync, la GPU integrata non sta lì a dormire ma viene utilizzata attivamente per l\'encoding video o per altre operazioni, come per esempio la timeline in Premiere. Il fratellino utilizza Adobe Premiere che può sfruttare questa tecnologia, ma anche altri programmi di video editing o streaming la usano, come per esempio OBS Studio, che può sfruttare l\'encoder video della GPU integrata per strimmare, lasciando libera la GPU dedicata per il gioco.In ogni caso, la GPU Integrata è la solita Intel UHD, sul 12400 è la UHD 730, sul 12500 la 770. Non l\'ho testata molto nel gaming, ma comunque non aspettatevi chissà cosa. La potenza di questa è simile alle entry level dedicate sui portatili di qualche anno fa come la 930M o giù di lì, quindi va bene per giochi leggeri. In ogni caso, non ha problemi di sorta quando si tratta di visualizzare video o immagini 3D non particolarmente complesse, regge senza problemi i video in 4k su youtube o giochini retro ed emulatori vari.Per quanto riguarda altre nomenclature criptiche, a volte vediamo Tray o Box, la differenza tra le due è la presenza del dissipatore nella versione Box. Come dicevo sopra, il dissipatore è scarso ma per una CPU come questa è sufficiente. Se invece il dissi non vi serve, prendete la versione Tray.PRENDO IL 12400, 12500 O 12600?Secondo me, tra questi tre il migliore è il 12400 e vi spiego anche il perché.Il 12400 e il 12500 sono fratelli, mentre il 12600 è a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore.Partiamo dal 12500, questo processore ha la stessa base del 12400 ma con frequenze di base e di boost poco più alte, oltre che una gpu integrata leggermente più potente (ovvero la Intel UHD 770 contro la 730 del 12400). Le frequenze più alte in buona sostanza si traducono in un miglioramento statico in media del 5%, di più o di meno a seconda del workload, ma praticamente mai sopra il 10%. La GPU integrata è di poco più potente, ma si tratta sempre di un\'integrata scarsissima poco adatta per il gaming a prescindere. Se la differenza di prezzo fosse di una decina di euro ci potrebbe anche stare, ma onestamente non mi viene in mente nessuna ragione per la quale il 12500 merita di esistere a quasi 100€ in più. Evitatelo. Io l\'ho comprato solo perché mi serviva di fretta e il venditore ha sbagliato a inviarmi il 12400F anziché il 12400. Altrimenti non l\'avrei mai comprato.Il 12600 invece è su un altro campo da gioco, ed è a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore. Come dicevo all\'inizio, oltre ai 6 P-Core il 12600 ha 4 E-Core, oltre che frequenze più alte, e la versione K se volete overcloccare. Per il prezzo di quasi 150€ sopra al 12400, potrebbe anche starci se rientra nel vostro budget e fate multitasking intenso o molte operazioni di rendering. Nel gaming sono praticamente uguali, la differenza tra i due si percepisce a framerate elevati e risoluzioni basse, in giochi AAA magari in 4k sarete limitati dalla GPU nella maggior parte dei casi. In ogni caso, se si vuole assemblare un PC con un budget più alto del mio e magari abbinato ad una GPU più potente della mia 3060, potrebbe valerne la pena, anche solo per la presenza degli E-Cores.Comunque, ritengo che il 12400 sia lo sweet spot, da considerare per qualunque PC di fascia media, valutando eventualmente un upgrade tra qualche anno alla generazione 13xxx quando caleranno i prezzi.CONCLUSIONEChe dire, il 12400 è una CPU di tutto rispetto, ad un prezzo molto conveniente tra l\'altro. È eccellente in una build da gaming di fascia media, abbinato ad una GPU un po\' seria, e non fatica nemmeno nei programmi di grafica professionali (utilizzati a livello amatoriale o scolastico).Sicuramente non vi sto dicendo niente di nuovo, ma lo consiglio appieno per build di fascia media e budget contenuto.', 'Acquistato durante il Prime Day a 150€, questo processore porta sulle spalle 6 core e 12 thread che, anche se può sembrare scontato, è ormai diventato lo standard per giocare, non prendiamoci in giro. Anche se il clock di partenza è 2.5 GHz, sappiate che la scheda madre attiva il turbo boost e vi fa arrivare fino a 4.4GHz. Per quanto riguarda i consumi, in uso normale sta sotto i 60w (20-50w), nei giochi massimo mi ha registrato (poi dipende) un carico massimo di 90w. Sotto stress, 117w precisi, netti, come dichiarato da intel. Ora però passiamo al maledetto tasto dolente che perseguita da anni questi processori: il dissipatore. Io ho provato diversi dissipatori, e devo dire che si sono impegnati, anche se il sistema push-pin rimane macchinoso (non entra alla perfezione). Lo so, vi sembra strano, ma anche se non è perfettamente agganciato, copre ugualmente tutta la superficie dissipante, potete stare tranquilli. In-game, la massima temperatura che ho registrato (con temperatura ambiente di 35°C) è stata di 85°C. Poi quando avevo provato con temperatura ambiente di 25°C, la temperatura è scesa a 78°C! Sembrano valori alti, ma fidatevi che per un dissipatore stock fa il suo sporco lavoro. Per questo motivo do 4 stelle.AGGIORNAMENTO 3 agosto 2023Ho disattivo l’intel Turbo Boost e adesso, anche quando gioco, non sale mai sopra i 68°C, abbassando quindi di 10°C la temperatura.

It does not come with a stock cooler, as the stock cpu cooler is inadequate for the I7I do NOT reccomend this purely for gaming, because the processor has 8 cores and 8 threads, which is overkill for most games, you would be better off buying an i5-9600kf which has 6 cores while still being overclock-able, it has no integrated graphics but, at a lower price.  You can invest thay money into something else, like a better graphics card or more SSD storage. make sure your system's performance is well balanced, won't be ideal to pair this with a GT 610 now...The cpu has a boost clock of 4.90 Ghz, and with some tweaking in the bios power settings you can improve its performance, go watch some YouTube videos on bios setting for this CPU.I brought it for a wide variety of applications where I required the extra cores, such as: gaming and streaming simultaneously, media creation, and rendering videos. I was able to render a 49 minute video at 1080p, 60fps, 12 Mbits bitrate, vbr 2 pass, under an hour while doing other things!Yes, it was constantly at 100% usage, but I was very surprised that it never peaked over 68°C, I only used a hyper 212 evo black, no water cooling, just 1 cpu fan.My cpu never hit its maximum tdp of 95 Watts though, so I am still leaving some performance on the table.At idle, my cpu draws about 8-20 Watts running discord, chrome, and a bunch of background applications.It is disappointing Intel disabled hyperthreadding for this cpu, therefore the cores and threads are the same number.The Cpu won't be a bottleneck during gameplay, it will be up to the rest of your system to do their part.While recording and streaming, you can easily do x264 encoding at medium preset in OBS, and still have enough performance for the game.I upgraded from an I3-8100, it was cheaper than getting ryzen as I would have needed another motherboard.Beware that your motherboard may not be able to supply enough power for this processor, if its relatively cheap, and is not reccomended for overclocking, it may damage the capacitors on the motherboard from too much current, be sure to look for reviews on your motherboard first to make an informed decision, its better not to risk destroying your motherboard and or other parts of your computer.Q: Do I need an unlocked Cpu?A: Most likely not! However overclocking is for squeezing out even more performance form the Cpu, so even if you aren't planning to get the best performance in the world, it's good to know that when your Cpu eventually becomes underpowered in the next few years, you can always overclock it a bit more to be able to match newer generations of hardware. But in the short term they do cost more money to buy.I do not believe making a new system with this cpu is a good Idea, as you won't be future proofing yourself.

Com certeza vai durar uns 10 anos no mínimo agora para eu atualizar o hardware do meu PC.', ""TL;DR at the endBought this CPU as an upgrade from my Ryzen 1700. I have a decent x370 motherboard (GIGABYTE Gaming 5), so I was wary about whether or not I should upgrade my motherboard as well; however, after making sure I was on the right bios version to support 3rd gen ryzen, I plopped this bad boy in and was immediately blown away. Gone are the days of CPU bottleneck for my 1080ti. Gone are the days of non-GPU accelerated video rendering and audio exporting. It for sure doubled my speed even with my 1700 overclocked to 3.8 GHz, and there's still more I can get out of it if I were to upgrade my mobo to an x570 board. Nonetheless, this chip is amazing. It's a bit pricey, but I feel like I'll be using this baby for much longer than I used my 1700. The ability to use my old hardware is a HUGE plus.The only con (minor) I noticed was it runs a bit hotter than my 1700, as expected, but it required some cooler tweaking to not have my PC sound like a jet engine 24/7. For context, I am using a corsair h100i v2 AIO cooler. At idle, the chip is between 45-50 ⁰C. It sits around 50⁰C when browsing YouTube and such. During 1080p gaming, games like AC Odyssey (max settings) were pushing it to 64⁰C max in a roughly 22⁰C atmosphere. Because the curves on the corsair link software settings were not set to handle water temps that the chip was producing, the fans were pushing 75% usage at just idle (default fans have 2400ish RPM limit). I had to spend a good hour or so and then some more time during gaming to customize and tweak the fan curve settings. It paid off because now my PC as quiet as possible while having stable temps for both the water and the CPU. I'd also recommend using Ryzen Master to check temps ad 3rd party software, at the moment, aren't reporting correct cpu temps (they show the temps as roughly 5-7⁰ hotter with more usage spikes)TL;DR:- If you invested in a good x370 board (~$180+) for the ryzen 1000 series, this CPU is a very good overall upgrade if you have the money to fork over for it. If not, the 3900x is also a great option (or any of the 3000 CPUs, honestly).- Make sure your cooler can handle the temps and the mobo vrm can deliver enough voltage (most x370s can).- Be prepared to modify settings for your cooling solution as the chip runs hotter than ryzen 1000 CPUs."", ""First off, yes, this CPU was very hard to get.  No time announced for when it would go on sale, broken search linking preventing the product page from being found without knowing exactly what to search for, and finally when the listing did go live it said you couldn't order it unless you went to the list of sellers and specifically selected Amazon.  Very strange.  To make matters worse, the product page only showed the minimal info on launch day so there was no way of knowing if Amazon was going to offer the game bundle or not.  Then when they got around to updating the page with the missing info, they added the info direct from AMD implying the game bundle was included.  Well, guess what, it's not.  I opened a ticket with Amazon support about it and was told they received no game bundle codes from AMD and I should go ask them about it.  Um, yeah, sure.  And the FAQ on the AMD rewards site specifically says it's on the retailers to distribute the codes.  So I and the others who managed to score one of these on launch day are out of luck there.  I'm tempted to deduct a star for that but I don't want to take anything away from the CPU itself.Alright, enough complaints about the low stock, strange order process, and misleading game bundle info.  The good news is this CPU is every bit as good as the reviews say it is.  So far after a solid day of testing I can say it's a crazy fast compute monster that runs cool, stable, and relatively quiet on my MSI MEG X570 Unify motherboard with a Noctua NH-D15 air cooler and 64GB (2x32GB) of Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 3200 C16 memory (CMK64GX4M2E3200C16) overclocked to 3600-18-22-22-42.  The other important bits in my system build are a Phanteks Enthoo Luxe case, Seasonic FOCUS GX-850 (SSR-850FX) 80+ Gold power supply, EVGA GeForce RTX 2080 (08G-P4-2081-KR) video card, and 1TB Samsung SM961 NVMe SSD running Win10 Pro 1909.  You can safely ignore AMD's water cooling recommendation as long as you get a good air cooler and ensure good air flow in your case.  Power consumption is amazingly low for such a powerful CPU.  Sure, it's going to pull more total power than low and most mid-range CPUs but this is still an extremely efficient processor.  Gaming performance is excellent.  Maybe not quite as good as Intel's best gaming CPUs but close enough provided you don't game for a living.  On the other hand, this thing rules the roost in video encoding.  It's amazing.  I do a mix of both so this CPU is the perfect balance for me."", 'Pues llego en tiempo y forma, como siempre amazon México con un servicio excelente, el procesador venía en una bolsa sin ninguna indicación de que es frágil afortunadamente el empaque del cpu es resistente, es un delite el solo hecho de tener la caja y verlo.Después de 3 días de empezar a usarlo es increíble tener tanto poder en un espacio tan pequeño, en si el cpu es pesado a comparación con el 1800x (el cual estoy actualizando), la mobo al que se lo instale es una crosshair vi hero x370, y va de maravilla, tenia mis dudas por el tema de la potencia pero al activar el precision boost overdrive, puedes darte cuenta que la placa esta sobrada en potencia, El oc máximo que se ha intentado es de 4.4 a 1.35v con una compensación a 1.41v a una temperatura máxima de 84°c la puntacion en CBR20 fue de 10,100 impresionante subir de 9,049 en stock mas de 1000 puntos, todo esto refrigerado por un kraken x72 en una configuración de 6 ventiladores noctua a 3000rpm (push and pull), en cuanto a ram se refiere son unas trident z a 3000mhz que perfectamente son estables con un oc a 3600mhz con 1.35v, afortunadamente aun son chip samsung B-die, eso ayuda bastante.Cabe hacer mención que después de varias pruebas el voltaje puede bajarse aun mas, ya que lo permite,con lo que se podría pulir un poco el tema del calentamiento, o al contrario intentar subir la frecuencia pero sinceramente no veo necesario hacerlo ya que con el hecho de poner las ram a 3600mhz, y activar precision boost overdrive, se logra un buen incremento en el rendimiento claro no comparado con un oc manual pero se podría decir que es una media,  logrando 9,590 en CBR20 a una temperatura de 73°c,  en procesos cotidianos con este cpu considero es lo mas adecuado, ya que si se tiene un sistema de water cooling costum valdría la pena el oc manual a mi consideración todo depende de los parámetros.En conclusión es un cpu monstruoso por el precio que tiene y comparado con mi antiguo 1800x y un olvidado 1920x es un cambio bastante radical, ya que se acaba de juntar en un solo equipo lo mejor de dos mundos gaming y workstation.', ""Salve a tutti dal buon Snake questo è XREVIEWS recensioni genuine per Amazon!Ho deciso di cambiare PC e vi do un'idea di una configurazione TOP-END che ho buildato sopra questa CPU:CPU RYZEN 9 3950X - 801,00 €AIO Kraken X73 - 174,00 €MOBO Gigabyte X570 AORUS XTREME - Warehouse Deal 545,00 €ALI Corsair Psu Hx1200I Platinum - Warehouse Deal 238,00 €SSD 2 x Sabrent SSD 1TB Rocket Nvme PCIe 4.0 M.2  488,00 €RAM 2 x G.Skill - Kit DIMM 32 GB DDR4-3600 F4-3600C16D-32GTZNC, Trident Z 427,00 €Avevo nel mio vecchio i7 7700k (che poi tanto vecchio non e') una GeForce 1080Ti e ho deciso di continuare con quella fino ad almeno la prossiama generazione.Che dire di questa CPU?

It can be a little nerve wracking as your removing the cpu mount and installing this one but its worth it. As the AM5 CPU has no pins (the mobo now has the pins), its imperative you are gentle on the placement. Best way I found to install this shield was to place the CPU into the socket, then remove the cpu holder so this way you can\'t damage the cpu or pins as they are socketed. Installing the shield from that point is easy, just don\'t overtighten it. Theres a bunch of youtube videos on this process. Definitely recommend reviewing them before attempting this step.I upgraded from my old Ryzen 5 2600X system with a GTX 960 SSC 4GB card and a 512gb M.2 Gen 2 drive.Needless to say this was quite the upgrade from my old system.Cinebench scores on my 2600X even with a mild overclock was only around 7200.After getting everything configured/setup and Windows 11 Pro installed with all updates and enabling EXPO1 (RAM OC) and enabling SAM in the BIOS I started my benchmarking.Cinebench score with just EXPO1 enabled baseline was 28745. What a jump!CPU temp on the multi-core threading with the 360 AIO only went as high as 82c (AMD rates these to run at 95c as normal operating temp so it was well below even that).Haven\'t done any OC\'ing other than enabling EXPO1 yet since I really don\'t need to as the CPU and GPU run everything maxed out.Tested on a few games on max/ultra settings and below are what I got FPS wise:The Division 2 (All settings maxed and on DX12) - Avg 125fps on 3440 x 1440 165hz resolutionAliens: Fireteam Elite - Avg 160fps on 3440 x 1440 165hz resolutionBorderlands 2 (older game I know but love to play it with max settings) - Avg 476fps on 3440 x 1440 165hz resolutionForza Horizon 5 - Ultra Settings (max) including Ray Tracing - Avg 155fps on 3440 x 1440 165hz resolutionAliens: Colonial Marines (older game) - Avg 190FPS on 3440 x 1440 165hz resolutionWarframe - Avg 155fps on 3440 x 1440 165hz resolutionPairing this CPU and GPU together worked great and the CPU itself is a beast. It does get hot when it turbo\'s up into the 5ghz range which is why you need a really good cooler (either AIO or custom loop) to keep the temps in check.If you do that, this CPU will be everything you need and then some.One thing I always tell people is to take your time, plan out your PC parts you want for what you want the system to do (video editing, gaming, streaming, etc). Don\'t be afraid to look around for good deals. I scored the AIO Cooler off Newegg for a much cheaper price than Amazon had it and it works beautifully and the LCD screen is just a nice ""geek"" factor to put JPG\'s or GIF\'s there.Once you have everything, take your time when building it. You may run into an issue here or there which is normal. First boot on AM5 systems is sometimes slow (Memory has to train) and you may see it cycle on/off for up to 1 minute. Mine did this and on the 4th power cycle it posted and I could get into the BIOS and everything showed up correctly.Good luck enthusiasts and hope this review helped with anyone looking at this CPU for their system!Its worth it!', ""I realize that a pc picture for a processor is pointless and just showing off, but isn't everyone who gets this showing off a little lol.

I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn\'t support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn\'t worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn\'t seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I\'ll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD\'s infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon\'s shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren\'t for me looking at my camera\'s, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn\'t have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!', 'É muito rápido, mas esquenta bastante, chega a usar 220W em teste de estresse.

I got the msi board z690 -a for 159, and this the 13900kf. I ‘ve been wanting a cpu with an IGPU for years, but couldn’t justify the price increase on the gpu version. I actually use a dgpu but it really is convenient, and they can be used to accelerate some work. Again, before you judge i'm using this for work, productivity. NOT gaming. I would spend 200 for a gaming cpu.my use case is productivity. i’m a developer, and this is the sole reason i upgraded. I was fighting windows freezing and slowing down during a lot of my workflows. I use wsl intellj, docker, react apps java etc, often at the same time. It’s pretty noticeable the improvement. It really helped.  Like that i could use ddr4 for now since the boards are about 150 it was acceptable.Heat: The cpu gets a bad reputation due to heat and wattage. I put this in the bucket frankly that amd got as well. I mean it’s fine they are using as much power as needed to maximize perf. I limited the cpu to 250w, and it runs on a d15 cooler than my 5900, Full load can get up to high 80c, but working is 30’s. you lose very little perf by running it more in the zone. I don't know about other boards but that msi one sure makes it easy and the price if right.About the cpu: it has a ton of cores, I didn't need to buy ddr5--  i need quite a lot of ram and it still costs too much for the benefit it provides in my workload. The memory controller on 13gen is far better than ryzen 5000 series. I couldn't before get my ddr4 stable at 4000 on the 5900x and it did it on the intel one immediately. Indeed i was even able to tighten up the timings just a touch. So modern processors (and i'd assume the amd ones as well) have made welcome improvements to memory support. Id' say if you don't need as much ram say 32gb, and you don't have ddr4 already to tide you over i'd consider getting ddr5 though.  I mean nothing is cheaper than what you have and 4k speed is fine. If i had nothing or maybe some old ram i'd go w/ ddr5.Price: For 570 it’s decent deal here. It is more than i love spending, but for what you get it is a lot better than what amd is offering at the time i write this which was 700.I do wish intel supported board reuse down the line, but that even can. be overblown (to an extent, and only an extent) though it's a selling feature to me frankly reuse!! I had to really think about that. I don't understand why intel is so stubborn on this subject.  with my amd cpu i went from 2700x to 5900x and the board went from a 470 to 570 because i waned more io and better pcie but i also gave that board to my kid and upgraded it one time. With intel especially I mean i just buy cheap boards anyway and upgrade more because there are a ton of features that get added half the time. I usually try to spend about 150 on a board, though it. is getting harder but it would be more my preference. I 'm not really onboard with the 600 motherboards. Is there a  300 one in-between i guess so but that's equally unappealing to me esp w/ out the upgrade.Tips/A rant if you will: trust me on this that msi board for 159 is so amazing. It really works great. don’t worry about the vrm. that’s also very overblown too. you can go calculate the amperage this will not come close. ALso msi is a great brand and the bios is easy to navigate. If you want fancy audio buy a dac that you can reuse and plug into usb and keep reusing it. Just think about what you really need in there. The msi board has a nice selection of pcie slots and well placed nvme. I use multiple gpu one nvidia gpu quatro for encoding (its a small one) and and amd one 6900 i bought for 570 for gaming. I just really love the layout connectivity and features of the board. They cut all the stuff i don't need and pared with the cpu it's all together about 700 for a cpu and board, pretty much as good as you can get."", ""Concerning Intel Core i9-13900KF,I have this CPU with board ASUS ROG Strix Z790-E Gaming WiFi 6E LGA 1700 for gaming usage.  Once I discovered that I had to slow the memory down from the 6600MHz XMP rating to 6200MHz, the board/cpu combo has worked very reliably  (multiple passes of OCCT Gold stress test).  Just checking the XMP II box,  the 6200MHz box and the (so called) AI overclocking box in the bios gives a score of 40K on Cinebench R23 so it's plenty fast -- the loss of 400MHz memory bandwidth isn't a big deal.  I tried various other adjustments but the latter turned out to be sufficiently fast and very reliable.  My current chip has a Silicon Predictor(SP) of 99 (roll of the dice).  I suspect that higher SP levels while possible are rare.I am using a ARCTIC Liquid Freezer II 360  AIO which works OK but the CPU can run hot.  The mother board cooling prediction for said AIO is 155 but that is not really enough for this chip to run all out.  It is easy to get this CPU up to 100C using OCT Power Stress test.  While the CPU might run at 100C for a long time, it will not do it any good and it will not run reliably -- I needed to check the 90C max box in the bios to get it to pass the OCCT power stress test.  I have a RTX 4090 and in the OCCT power test the net system power gets up to 1100W.  Normal gaming so far never gets to such power levels but still worth considering.FWIW, I have had a CPU apparently fail from running the OCCT Power Stress test.  If you want to run this CPU all out with reasonable temps, you really need significant cooling.  I doubt any AIO will work for this.  I suggest an open loop system with something like a Watercool MO-RA3 420 PRO radiator.All said, If you are building a gaming system, you would be just as well served with a ASUS ROG Strix Z690-E and a i9-12900KF CPU.  It will be easier to cool and will save you some money for a better graphics card which will make *much* more difference in most games than the CPU."", 'Es un procesador muy poderoso y se calienta por lo tanto vas a necesitar una buena refrigeración liquida así que no ahorres en la refrigeración de este procesador.', ""The Intel Core i9-13900KF is an absolute beast!

I’m a pretty hardcore gamer and this cpu is the most amazing thing I’ve ever had when it comes to a high end build. I paired it with a rtx 4080 and needless to say this cpu doesn’t disappoint. Now, this review isn’t about pricing because we all know this cpu is expensive and honestly if you’re only gaming then maybe a 13600k would suffice. However, if you are streaming, photo editing, video editing etc…. Then this is the right cpu for you. I’m able to snap together YouTube videos in seconds NOT minutes or anywhere near it. I’m able to stream and game at the same time with less than a 10 fps loss while gaming and streaming on the highest quality settings. My wife loves it for photo editing bc everything is just perfect. Only downside is that it does run hot but you can get a good 240-360mm aio that will tame this cpu with ease. All the issues I use to have on the 10th gen platform are completely irradiated now that I own this cpu. I did go with the ddr5 and honestly for me it runs better than ddr4. Tech reviewers say otherwise but from personal experience ddr5 is the future NOW. Performance issues I use to have with ddr4 and weaker cpus are just gone now. I can do so much and this cpu doesn’t break a sweat. For instance, ddr4 for whatever reason sometimes wouldn’t work with xmp although it was advertised. I like to tinker so it wasn’t an issue BUT sometimes it’s just nice to do a single click and let it dial itself in and that’s what ddr5 has done for me. I’ve used several different sticks with this cpu and from all of them I went with Corsair vengeance. Honestly, this is the most bada$$ cpu I’ve ever owned or seen in a personal system of mine. If you have the money I couldn’t recommend it enough. Everybody has different needs and in my case I needed this cpu. It hasn’t disappointed. As for amd, if you want the bugs and issues go ahead and grab one of those cpus and tell me how that goes. This cpu can do everything and more.

Además, pasa lo mismo con el 3900XT son 100MHz más. El 3900X me parece la mejor opción de compra además las BIOS ya está pulidas.**** Se supone que este procesador su frecuencia base es de 3,8GHz y llega hasta 4,6GHz, yo usando el modo automático de MSI trabaja todos los núcleos a 4,2GHz, todo esto a una temperatura de 36°C (Sin carga de trabajo), ahora en renderización de video llega a 4,3GHz pero nunca ha superado esos 4,3GHz (A ver si con las nuevas BIOS mejora esto)', ""It is fast, runs cool, and has 12 cores and 24 threads.

‎B0BBHHT8LY,"AMD Ryzen™ 7 7700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor",Processors,S$571.20,https://www.amazon.sg/AMD-7700X-16-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BBHHT8LY/ref=sr_1_53?qid=1695818994&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051&rnid=7993546051&s=electronics&sr=1-53,https://www.amazon.sg/AMD-7700X-16-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/product-reviews/B0BBHHT8LY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,4.7,"[""I decided to upgrade from AM4 and my 5800X to this beast of a cpu, the 7700X. On the one hand, I now have a brand, spanking new AM5 platform and cpu. On the other hand, it was a very expensive upgrade due to the stupidly high early adopter tax. I also had to buy two new modules of M.2 (pcie) SSD's because AM5 does not support sata based M.2. A very expensive investment indeed.Back to the 7700X. I am very happy. It is definitely faster than my 5800X and notably more snappy in various programs such as video editing and gaming. I can believe AMD's claims that it is 13% faster than the 5800X.I do not understand why some people (I will come back to this) are complaining about it being too hot, etc. Yes, it does run hot (but so does 12 and 13 gen intel), but the 7700X is nowhere as hot as intel.When I had PBO and auto-OC activated for my 5800X, the Noctua industrial fans on my air cooler were running at full pelt and sounded like a jet engine. The 5800X also ran hot, at up to 70c. In the end, I deactivated PBO and auto-OC to get far better thermals and acoustics (but at a cost of somewhat decreased performance).The 7700X did run hot under load with PBO and auto-OC turned on, as I saw temperatures go up to 57c on tasks. With gaming, it would go up to 65c (depending on the game). At idle, my 7700X would sit at circa 45c.After a bit of tinkering in BIOS and disabling PBO and auto-OC, my 7700X is currently sitting at a very comfortable and constant 35c. This is with a single tower air cooler and two fans (same cooling solution as with my 5800X).Also, during activated PBO and auto-OC, my fans were only intermittently running like jet engines and then would calm down (7700X). With these two features deactivated, my Arctic Freezer Esport34 duo air cooler is now running almost silently.To summarise, my 7700X is definitely running cooler and faster than my previous 5800X under different BIOS scenarios and work loads.Note - For the very first time, AMD has included a built in (integrated) graphics chip for 7 series Ryzen (including my 7700X). I have not yet tested the iGPU, but I will in due course, when the time is right. I will then update my review.Moving on, particularly to one individual who posted a review on 07/10/22 and was whining about the cost of the 7700X and heat output. Yes the release MSRP for the 7700X is over-priced at between £430 and £440 in UK, whilst it is selling for $400 in USA (when the 5800X was released, the UK msrp was £400).IMHO, the 7700X should not be more than £380. Sadly, the current high price is mostly due to the atrocious state of the british economy, with some good old fashioned price gouging thrown in for good measure.I also remember when Zen1 was released in March 2017, the 1800X (which I purchased) was retailing for £500, the 1700X at £400 and 1700 non-X at £340.This individual was also whining about the supposedly bad physical design for Ryzen 7K series cpu as the metal lid is sitting c.4mm higher on the actual chip. He claimed the thermal paste kept dripping down the sides of the metal plate and it was so bad that Noctua were forced to release an AM5 cpu guard (NATPG1).From my own experience, I have had no such issues whatsoever. So this dribbling TP problem comes down to user error and especially competency (more specifically, lack thereof). Mind you, I have been building pc's since March 2007, so I have a lot of experience.Hurdygurdy then concluded that Ryzen-7 and X670 is very difficult to justify at such absurdly hiked up msrp. He even stated that entry level X670 was grossly over priced at £500 and concluded he would be migrating back to intel, bearing in mind the imminent release of Raptor Lake.Please ignore his review as he is clearly an intel fanboy. First of all, who shells out >£1K for an AM5 platform and then decides he does not like it, due to high msrp and heat issues?. If you did not like the price of AM5 and 7700X, then why did you supposedly buy it in the first place?.Secondly, entry level AM5 mobos do not cost £500. In fact, my top dog Gigabyte Aorus Master X670E cost £500. The entry level X670-P mobo msrp starts at £268. The entry level X670E mobo msrp start at £300.Let me put things in perspective by now comparing the 7700X (8c/16t) to intel Raptor Lake. The 13700K Raptor Lake (8 Performance cores/16t with 8 economy cores/8t) costs £500 and the last generation 12700K Alder Lake (8c/16t) costs £416. This is in stark contrast to the new architecture 7700X which cost £430. So if you want the 13700K, that is an extra £70 you have to shell out. But is it worth the extra expenditure?. I will come to that later on.As mentioned, my AM5 mobo cost £500 and if I look at exactly the same brand/model mobo but for intel platform (Gigabyte Aorus Master, Z790, LGA 1700), then it is costing £620. For around the £500 price point, I am seeing the mid range Z790-F for £480. So the same tier intel mobo is £120 more expensive. Again, is it worth the extra expenditure?.IMHO, it most definitely is not as the Gigabyte AM5 and Z790 variants have very similar features.The only price advantage that the Z790 has over AM5 is that it is compatible with DDR4 and DDR5, whereas AM5 is compatible only with DDR5. TBH, I purchased from Amazon, a Crucial 16GB DDR5 module for £64. So not bad at all.In terms of benchmark comparisons, according to WCCFTECH, RGT, etc the 7700X is virtually on par with the last gen 5900X (12c/24t). That is a very good performance upgrade.According to Hardware Times, the 7700X narrowly beats the i7-13700K in gaming, but the 7700X is slightly slower in (synthetic) content creation.According to benchmarks by Hardware unboxed, the 13700K is only 3% to 7% faster than the 7700X in gaming (dependent on different games) and about 4% to 10% faster in productivity (depending on different productivity tasks).Ultimately, it comes down to buyer preference. I see no benefit is shelling out c. £200 more for an intel platform.On hindsight, I should have upgraded my 5800X to a 5900X (£330 new in June 2022). This would have been the cheapest and most convenient upgrade option. I could then sit tight and wait for the MSRP of AM5 and Ryzen-7 to drop down to a more palatable level (Q1-23), bearing in mind Zen4 global sales have been very poor due to the high prices of Zen4, AM5 mobos and having to migrate to expensive DDR5 RAM. As a result, AMD has made the decision to cut back Zen4 production in order to keep msrp artificially high (instead of maintaining Zen4 production and reducing msrp to sensible levels, which would encourage consumer purchasing). AMD is now adopting the same policies as intel and nvidia."", 'Sin duda es un procesador muy potente, pero que con un Noctua NH-D15 ( que es lo mejorcito del mercado en refrigeración por aire ) se ponga a mas de 90 grados a la mínima que le metes un poco de caña, me parece una burrada, por mucho que AMD diga que estos procesadores de la serie 7000 están preparados para eso...Por muy preparados que estén, esas temperaturas van a afectar, si o si, a su vida útil y a la de los demás componentes que están dentro de tu equipo...Y los que sepáis un poco del tema me diréis que puedo poner el procesador en modo ""Eco"" utilizando el software AMD Ryzen Master ( o modificarlo a través de la BIOS ) y así será mas difícil que llegue a esas temperaturas.... Pues sí, así es, aunque a cambio su rendimiento se verá ligeramente afectado... Y, al menos a mi, no me parece muy normal comprar un procesador y limitar su rendimiento, por poco que sea, para que funcione a unas temperaturas mínimamente aceptables... ( tampoco mucho mas aceptables ).Otra cosa que no me termina de convencer es la forma de funcionar de estos Ryzen y que ya era similar en los anteriores. Concretamente los continuos ""spikes"" o ""picos"" de frecuencia a la que funcionan los núcleos del procesador y por consiguiente también picos de temperatura y acelerones de los ventiladores del refrigerador, que por muy silenciosos que sean, llega a apreciarse y es bastante molesto en un entorno silencioso.Por último, el consumo del que tanto se habla últimamente... Pues bien, si hipotéticamente tuvieses tu procesador trabajando al 100%, tu Ryzen consumiría menos que un Intel de características similares...PERO, cuánto tiempo tienes el procesador trabajando al 100% y cuánto tiempo en lo que se llama ""idle"" o mínimamente activo? Pues para el uso típico de un usuario medio, el procesador va a estar en ""idle"" muchísimo mas tiempo que trabajando a tope, y en ese estado, el Intel va a consumir mucho menos... No lo digo yo ( que también, porque lo he comprobado ) sino todos los test que se han hecho al respecto y que decidí investigar al ver el alto consumo de este 7700X en reposo o ""idle"".No me enrollo mas. Aun estoy en duda si quedarme con él o devolverlo y cambiarlo por un Intel como por ejemplo el i5-13500, que siendo mas barato, gracias a su mayor cantidad de núcleos, en productividad está mas o menos a la altura de este Ryzen 7700X.', ""Meant to buy a 7600x for a friend but didn't realize i had gotten this one, but it works perfect and can handle what you throw at it. Only issue i've ran into (when i say i, i mean the friend i gave it to who has then told me the issues he ran into) was that when you're on linux and don't currently have a gpu installed, the APU sort of just doesn't desire to operate as it should and you wind up with a solid white desktop environment with nothing else. But if you only use a TTY then you're good to go! But for most i would recommend getting a gpu alongside it if you're on linux until amd decides to offer better support for the APU inside of it.

Una volta viste le prestazioni che sono in grado di tirare fuori ho capito il perché delle temperature, davvero impressionante! Questa serie è micidiale!

Ich habe mir die beiden Prozessoren, den 7700X und den 7700, genauer angesehen, und ich möchte dir mitteilen, dass ich mich letztendlich für den 7700 entschieden habe. Warum? Nun, es gibt einen deutlichen Unterschied beim Kühlen dieser beiden CPUs.Der 7700X hat eine TDP von 105, was bedeutet, dass er mehr Wärme erzeugt und schwieriger zu kühlen ist, insbesondere in kleineren Gehäusen wie ITX oder M-ATX. Bei solchen Gehäusen ist die Wärmeableitung oft eine Herausforderung, und ein Prozessor mit höherer TDP kann zu höheren Temperaturen führen, die die Leistung beeinträchtigen oder sogar zu thermischen Problemen führen können.Aus diesem Grund habe ich mich für den 7700 entschieden, der eine niedrigere TDP von nur 65 hat. Mit dieser geringeren TDP produziert er weniger Wärme und ist einfacher zu kühlen. Dies ist besonders wichtig, wenn du ein kompaktes Gehäuse verwendest, da die begrenzte Größe den Luftstrom und die Kühlung beeinträchtigen kann.Dank der niedrigeren TDP des 7700 kannst du eine bessere Kontrolle über die Temperaturen in deinem System haben und somit eine stabilere Leistung gewährleisten. Du kannst einen Kühler wählen, der besser zu deinen Bedürfnissen passt und die optimale Kühlung für deine CPU bietet.Insgesamt bin ich mit meiner Wahl des AMD 7700 zufrieden, da ich dadurch in meinem ITX- oder M-ATX-System eine bessere Kühlung erreichen kann. Die niedrigere TDP macht einen deutlichen Unterschied und sorgt dafür, dass mein Prozessor auch unter Last kühl bleibt.Ich hoffe, diese Bewertung hilft dir bei deiner Entscheidung, und wenn du weitere Fragen hast, stehe ich gerne zur Verfügung!', 'Utilizando em uma Asus Tuf Gaming B650M Wifi.

Il vero test, però, è arrivato quando ho iniziato a lavorare da casa, dovendo gestire diverse applicazioni contemporaneamente. Nonostante il carico di lavoro, l'i5-9600K ha dimostrato di essere all'altezza della situazione, permettendomi di svolgere le mie attività senza alcun rallentamento.Punti di Forza:Il principale punto di forza di questo processore è senza dubbio la sua performance. L'i5-9600K è infatti un vero e proprio campione di velocità e multitasking, capace di gestire anche i carichi di lavoro più pesanti senza alcun problema. Inoltre, nonostante le elevate prestazioni, il calore generato rimane sempre nei limiti della norma, un dettaglio non da poco se consideriamo che un'eccessiva temperatura può ridurre la vita del processore e danneggiare altri componenti del PC.Punti di Debolezza:Nonostante l'i5-9600K sia un ottimo processore, non è esente da difetti. Il primo è legato al costo: se da un lato la qualità e le prestazioni sono indubbie, dall'altro il prezzo potrebbe risultare proibitivo per chi sta assemblando un PC con un budget limitato. Un altro aspetto da considerare è l'assenza di un dissipatore nella confezione, elemento che dovrà quindi essere acquistato separatamente. Infine, per sfruttare al meglio le capacità di overclocking dell'i5-9600K, sarà necessario disporre di una scheda madre e di un sistema di raffreddamento adeguati.Conclusioni:Nonostante alcune piccole pecche, l'i5-9600K è un processore che consiglierei senza esitazioni.

After overclocking it actually beats or matches the 5800x overall even when compared against a PBOed 5800x. By ""overall"" I mean when comparing these cpus in a large range of games (30+ games) and not just 4-5, (something that some biased reviews do)(b) Productivity is very good too although in heavy multithreaded applications (e.g. tile-based rendering) it does lose by 10-20% to both the 11700k and the 5800x. That said it reduces the deficit to only 3-15% in an overclocked vs overclocked battle, thanks to its higher overclocking potential.(c) It runs pretty cool - I am using a Noctua NH-D15 and is also very silent. Even on stock auto motherboard settings (and with power limits removed) I don\'t get temps above 68-69C even when running Cinebench R23 in a loop and sustaining indefinitely the stock all-core 4.7GHz. Temps reduce further when you manually tune the voltage to a lower value (a practice known as undervolting) or when you apply a better thermal paste or a case with better airflow. You can also undervolt and still overclock. Or overclock more without increasing the voltage above its stock value.(d) I paired it with a fairly high-end Asus Z490 (Strix-E) board instead of a Z590 one.  There is no reason buying a Z590 board for 10th gen cpus as for the same price you typically don\'t get ""enthusiast"" features (such as postcode, third PCIe x16 slot, PCIe bifurcation, etc). Moreover most of the ""goodies"" of the Z590 boards (e.g. PCIe4, additional M.2 slot, DMI3x8) are only enabled when using an 11th gen cpu. So buying a Z590 for 10th gen is a bit of a waste.(e) Currently the price of the 11700K +Z590 is around 200 euros higher than that of the 10700K+Z490 combo. If the difference drops to 60-80 euros then I would advise to go for the former instead. But as of now the 10700K+Z490 combo is the wiser choice.', 'Don’t let the 125w TDP fool ya because this chip runs WAY cooler than previous gens. Tested temps using OCCT stress test for about 3 hours, alongside my Noctua NH-D15 cooler. The highest I’ve seen the temp spike up to was 71c. Note that OCCT is a heavy synthetic test that pushes the CPU to the limit. Regular gaming temps will never reach that high. I’ve had the chip for almost two months now and accumulated quite a bit of gaming hours during that time. The games I played included a mix of intensive AAA titles like CoD Warzone and AC: Odyssey to light eSport ones such as Rocket League and Rainbow Six Siege. Highest temps are always in the 50s to mid 60s range. That is a huge difference compared to my old i5 6600k that spiked to over 80c at times! My brother who bought a 9900k last year was also amazed by how much cooler 10th gen runs and even said that he wished he waited a bit longer before upgrading. Note that both the 9900k and 6600k have lower TDPs than the 10700k yet still run warmer. The reason as to why 10th gen runs cooler is because intel made modifications to the IHS of the cpu and upgraded their Thermal Interface Material. Other then the improvement in the temperature department, I’ve also noticed a big difference in gaming performance. Despite having a 2080 super, my PC used to struggle to reach and stay at a consistent 100+fps at 1080p. CPU intensive games like AC Odyssey often dropped to like 50fps. This is a clear indication that there was bottleneck on the CPU side. With this new 10700k, My PC now has no problems reaching and maintaining that sweet consistent 144+ FPS on light competitive eSport titles and 100+FPS on demanding CPU intensive AAA titles. Also, note that I am running the CPU at stock settings right out the box and have not messed with overclocking yet. Nonetheless, I am very satisfied with this CPU and I highly recommend it.', ""While a good idea anyway, with many processors now utilizing stock overclocks, you can benefit a performance boost by choosing a better CPU cooler. I went the cheap route, actually, I thought it was middle of the road since the Thermaltake Contac Silent 12 is rated for 150w. I thought I could get away with a $30 cooler since I am not planning on overclocking. That cooler could not even keep up with stock CPU settings. In benchmarks the CPU hit 80-Celsius in seconds and gradually up to 90 where I had it set to throttle. In more practical testing, under basic workloads the temps are more reasonable but the Contac Silent 12 has to ramp up to %100 fan speed frequently to keep that way and it is not quiet at that speed. I know somebody is going to say that's because the default settings on the motherboard are overclocking the CPU beyond Intel's recommended settings. Well, that was one of the first things I checked and that's not the case here. Despite what somebody on YouTube said or didn't say, not all motherboards do that. It is a great processor and complements my workload nicely (no games here). The new cooler is a Reeven Justice, $45 right now. I has the same size 120mm fan however it has six heat pipes instead of four and the tower is about %50 thicker and fins stacked closer together. Temps, while still pretty hot, have come down 8-10 degrees on Cinebench R-20. It still gets up to 80-82 Celsius but instead of hitting 80 right away as it did before, it takes until the render is almost complete and seems to level off there. I feel better about the temps now that It's not riding on the ceiling, especially since all core full load is not a typical workload for me. The fan is much quieter during typical use. I would recommend that cooler for those who are looking for a good compatible cooler."", '中古品が出品されるのは、運だが安く買えるのが嬉しい。今の所安定して使えてます。', ""Yeah I know, Ryzens are cheaper, and out perform the Intel chips in everything... except clocks. As a gamer, I want the highest single core speed possible, 16 threads instead of 32? Whatever, I don't need that many for my uses, lol.I don't upgrade often, and until now I was still running my trusty 4790k, which still can hold it's own pretty well, but now with the 10700k, the 1080 isn't bottlenecked by my CPU any more, and it's VERY noticeable in certain games I normally saw slight issues.Should you upgrade 9th gen, or even 8th gen to 10th gen? Honestly, probably not. But if you're say, a few of more generations behind now, it's a worthy upgrade. Yes it's an upgraded 9900k, but that's still really good for ~$400!(pic included just because I find it hilarious how absurdly big the Noctua D15 cooler is)1 MONTH UPDATE:So yeah it's just shy of a month using it and it's been a beast.

This rarely happens but from time to time this can happen.I contacted Intel and asked for a replacement and they agreed as it was under warranty obviously. While I had to pay like $10 to ship it to them which I originally thought was sorta cheap since other companies like MSI cover the shipping costs I can see why Intel doesn't.While I only paid $10 for shipping I assumed it would be ground shipping from Canada to the middle of the USA and figured I'd be without a CPU for up to 2-weeks.Turns out Intel ships via Air and my package was on a Plane and arrived at the facility within 8 hours and I had a new CPU in my computer within 72 hours.I would highly recommend this product even after my issues because Intel was as fast as possible with replacing mine.After using this product for a few months it's worked great and performs perfectly and I've had no issues since getting the original replaced."", 'I waited too long to switch back to the FPS king. This chip is amazing. I missed you Intel.The PC world is weird. Always chasing $50 savings. Too many games have CPU bottlenecks. I debated hard between just buying a 3700x to replace my 2700x versus the hard MB/CPU upgrade to Intel. But AMD had left me frustrated. My 2700x was never maxed out and I couldn’t tell what was bottleknecking me. The 3700x didn’t promise much higher clock speeds so I wasn’t sure if an upgrade would help. I play Rust on 1440p and my GPU and CPU would sit at 60% utilization or less with frames only around 70fps. First test with the 10700k stock and I’m at 135fps, max graphic settings. My GPU is now pumping out 99% utilization and the game feels amazing.This chip runs cool on stock. Idk where all the bad thermal predictions came from, but it didn’t happen. Haven’t even OC’d it yet and honestly I may not need to until I upgrade off of my 2080super. But that’s not happening any time soon. I’m hitting 144fps on 1440p max settings now in every FPS game and that was the goal.Thank you Intel, you nailed this one. The 9th gen had some cost/heat issues and that made me give AMD a try and I’m glad to be back!For anyone choosing a card. The 10700k is the sweet spot for gaming and streaming. If you only game, I think the 10600k is a cheaper but same performance. I don’t see any need for the 10900k.']"

Links to the other parts are included (all available at Amazon for good prices). You\'ll read this review on each of the other parts as well.WHY DID I BUY IT? I recently built and absolute beast of a computer and kept my older one as a backup. Unfortunately, it decided to take a dive this past week with the motherboard failing catastropically. Given that it was 10 years old, I decided to replace the ""brains"" with something a little more modern, but not overkill. Because I had spent a LOT of money on a computer recently, I was trying to keep the repair under about $400 and here\'s what I did...The BRAINS...Intel i3-10100 Processor ($100): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086MMRW87MSI Mag B460 Motherboard ($110): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GXVP1DMTeamGroup 16GB DDR4 ($60): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WNQVBZ6*** These are the main parts that MUST be compatible.. and they are ***I was worried about my hard drive, so I went ahead and splurged on a TeamGroup 1TB SSD ($75 -- www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PX2KKHM) bringing my total to just under $400. I could have kept my old Seagate 500gb 5400 RPM drive but I had a little extra to spend and that greatly sped up boot and wait times.For what it\'s worth, I also kept my existing Antec Power Supply (550W) that was replaced about a year ago, my case, and my now very old graphics card (R9 380 - 4gb). I already had a good monitor, mouse, and keyboard so those carried over as well.So how did it go together? Pretty seamlessly with just 2 little hiccups.HICCUP #1RAM: I did not realize the motherboard I purchased has a standard RAM speed of 2666. It can get up to a max of 2933. So the RAM I purchased (3200 speed, CL 16) is overkill and I could have saved another $20 or so. But, I didn\'t... and it\'s my first build with TeamGroup RAM and I\'m happy with it.HICCUP #2LAN/AUDIO: Once I got everything installed, the LAN would not connect to my network (wired, ethernet connection). A little troubleshooting found out YOU MUST TO UPGRADE THE LAN DRIVER for it to work. This means having another computer with internet and a flash drive. Likewise, I went ahead and updated the Audio driver and the sound was much crisper. So... take a moment and download all of the drivers in advance from the MSI website.FIRST POWER ON: The computer started up, then turned off immediately. It then restarted on it\'s own and said the motherboard had detected changes so I needed to configure the BIOS. Entering BIOS found that everything was recognized. So I changed the first boot device to USB flash drive and plugged in my Windows 10 install flash drive and restarted.Bottom Line: The Intel i3-10100 is a great little chip (not overclockable). The MSI 460 Torpedo is a decent motherboard (just update the LAN and Audio drivers) that boots quickly. In fact, it boots so quickly, I don\'t even see the POST screen. From cold to Windows is easily under 30 seconds.The RAM is stable at 2666 and fast enough that I probably won\'t even push the 2933 setting. The SSD is very fast (functionally almost as fast as the M2 drive I have in my beast at a savings of $20-25). Even with the aging R9 graphics card, I\'m easily hitting 60 FPS on modern titles at 1080 in medium to high settings. Sometime next year when graphics card prices drop to a reasonable level, I\'ll update that and have a second gaming rig ready.Overall, I\'m very happy with this setup.', 'Paired this with a Crucial BX500 1TB SSD, CORSAIR VENGEANCELPX 64GB RAM and the ASUS Prime H510M-E mother board.The Movavi video editor now loads a file ready for editing in less than 4 seconds (my previous setup with 32Gb RAM used to take 90 seconds).', 'Built a computer for the relative as a very early Christmas gift or a reverse birthday gift (my birthday, but I give you gifts), who honestly would probably be doing very little with it to justify a 4 core/8 thread current generation processor if it\'s web browsing, video conferencing, YouTube for music and the general emailing stuff. I put an RX 580 in it as well as 2x8GB 2666 DDR4 RAM and 2 500GB HDDs.I would definitely say the thing itself is quite the ""sleeper""! It\'s gonna run your games at console and above performance with a simpler GPU at lower settings, and it\'ll destroy on a much more advanced GPU. It\'s a good email/web/very light gaming/YouTube browser alone thanks to this particular CPU\'s integrated GPU, turning it into an APU (Accelerated Processing Unit). It\'s not a workstation processor due to its four core and eight thread composition. It can take in eight tasks and work on them, but it can only digest four at a time.If you\'re looking for a desktop PC and know how to or someone who does know how to build it, This is all you need and more.If you\'re into gaming on a console but want to try it on a computer and have a sub $1000 budget, get this and do some research before building, spend a few weeks on PC building knowledge. I recommend if buying this a B460 Motherboard, 2x8GB RAM sticks, a new HDD/SSD/M.2 PCIe SSD of at least 1TB/500GB/500GB, HDD is slow but cheap, lasts a good few years without fail and large in storage, SSD is fast and usually lasts long with less storage space (do not buy DRAM-less SSDs, lack of SSD RAM will damage the drive much faster), M.2 PCIe SSD is very fast but most expensive, no SATA cables needed but does disable one SATA port on most motherboards due to it sharing the same data lane.If you want a workstation, try either Intel\'s Core i7 or i9 Series, or AMD\'s Ryzen 7 or Ryzen 9 Series processors.', ""Pagato 125 euro.

I suppose I was very lucky because all the stock in these sold out in about 30 minutes after I got an email notification. Then the site went back to absurd scalper pricing from 3rd parties (avoid those, boycott them).-I am using the 3400G for a ""home theater"" computer. At the MSRP price, paired with an Asus B450-F Gaming II mainboard that amazon also had at a great sale price, this CPU is working out well. Keep in mind however, that some BIOS CPU tuning is required. As a side note, I am using the Vetroo V5 air cooler. The Vetroo V5 has been holding idle tempts at 30C or so (CPU tuned to constant 4,000mhz clock speed), and rarely hitting 50C when pumping 2160p60 video from the web for smooth streaming playback. I\'m not using this computer for gaming or video editing (such as with the Davinci Resolve editor). I am also using 32GBs of 3200mhz ADATA brand DRAM, with DOCP enabled. The AMD Ryzen 3400G\'s Vega 11 Graphics component reserves 2GB of RAM for dedicated graphics processing. With the CPU tuned to run at a constant 4,000mhz, the KODI home theater software application pumps steady, smooth, frame rate video.-My CPU/BIOS optimization experience: I discovered that, out the box, the Asus bios setup the AMD 3400G to constantly throttle its clock speed down to the 1700mhz range. As the 3400G kept throttling down, smooth HD video playback was impossible. However, once I used the Asus BIOS auto ""tweaker"" feature, and set the CPU to hold at a constant 4,000mhz CPU clock speed, I have been experiencing snappy ""home theater"" software performance. I also discovered that it is very necessary to update the Windows OS to the latest network/ethernet device driver and to add some obscure advanced network device driver settings configuration (see various youtube videos about these obscure ethernet driver tuning settings) in order to obtain smooth 1080p60, 1440p60, etc., internet video streaming performance.-Note also that, when connecting to a HDTV via HDMI, that 2160p60 is NOT possible unless the both the HDTV supports HDMI 2.1 for 2160p at 60hz refresh, as well as the MOBO in use. Based on my experience so far, 2160p (so called 4K), isn\'t that noticeably better beyond well smoothed, crisp, 1080p60 HDTV output anyway.-After the Asus MOBO BIOS tuning, and Windows OS network device driver updating noted above, I have been extremely happy that a $149.00 MSRP AMD CPU has more than enough processing power to provide an excellent home theater computer experience with the KODI home theater software application running my movie and music library (KODI takes a LOT of time to setup though).-The AMD Ryzen Vega 11 APU graphics included with the AMD Ryzen 3400G have been quite adequate for my ""home theater"" needs. I also recently purchased an AMD Ryzen 3200G, also available from amazon at MSRP from time to time. The graphics in the AMD Ryzen 3200G, which has more limited resolutions and refresh rates, are NOT at all as good as the 3400G graphics. The additional price for the AMD Ryzen 3400G over the 3200G is well worth it. However, for building office/business computers to run MSFT office and such, the $99 AMD Ryzen 3200G appears to provide more than enough processing power.-SYSTEM SETUP WITH THE AMD Ryzen 3400G- AMD Ryzen AMD 3400G- Asus ROG Strix B450-F Gaming II- Vetroo V5 CPU Air Cooler (Arctic brand NO rgb fans installed on it)- Montech Century 850W PSU- Fractal Design Meshify 2 Compact case (using the stock fans tuned with DC mode in BIOS)- (2) PNY XLR8 CS3030 500GB M.2 PCIe NVMe Gen3 x4 SSD) - system drive- - second matching drive for daily auto cloning backup with Macrium Reflect software- (2) Toshiba N300 8TB NAS HD for home theater media storage (RAID 1 / mirroring)- - 8TB total usable mirrored storage-----------------If you can get an AMD Ryzen AMD 3400G directly from amazon at MSRP, it is can excellent value CPU.

I used to use Asus all my life (beginning from core 2 duo processors or even Pentium 4).So, the system was ready to go and it was fast, quiet desktop with Fractal Design R4 case and Noctua D15 cooler( with two fans).No more fans than stock ones in my FD case (one for intake and other for outtake at the back).I OCed the system to 48Ghz at 1.26 Adaptive voltage or so (I don't remember exact number of voltage but 100% it was lower than 1.3v).And I created my computer and I looked at it and it was nice :)But then I started to view benchmarks, assessments in syntetic tests and noticed that 9700k is faster than 8700k in most cases. It faster than 7820x in most scenarios but....But 9900k is much more faster in rendering, photo editing and streaming tasks. In two words, in those cases where multithreading takes place and all real cores + virtual cores are used at their 100%.And ... I made a decision to purchase 9900k.It's a costly investment but I thought I would sell my current X99 5820k computer + sell 9700k processor.It's as good as done.My 9900k was in my hands and....And only then I discovered from various reviews about bad VRMs out there for medium line ASUS Z390 boards.I was frustrated.How come?Why ASUS did so?Should I buy new motherboard now?My Z390 Prime-A is a medium line MB (in one line with Strix and maybe a little worse than Z390 Maximus Hero).I started to research and came to conclusion (having tons of sources in the net, including video reviews + comments to them, articles, reviews from community etc etc) that my ASUS Z390 Prime-A will be suffice for 9900k with moderate OC. To which extent - this is the question.Will I surrender or try?Am I a risky person?No I am not.But... how hard I wanted to try... I could not control myself and I did it.So... ASUS z390 Prime-A + 9900k + 32Gb 4x8 Corsair Vengence + Noctua D15 + PSU Corsair 650X + two more 140mm fans for my case (one for upper outtake and one additional for front intake)Thermal paste I applied to the processor is Arctic MX2Also, I must specifically note for people who will use the config. I used discreet graphics card (XFX RX 580), I did not use internal graphics. Maybe usage of internal graphics may cost you more in temperatures and wattage.When I first started my computer I entered BIOS andI STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU TO IT: TURN MCE OFF IN BIOS.This is the most important thing you can do.Why?Main reason to do so is the MCE puts very high default voltage to the processor.Then increase power limits:Long Duration Package Limit is 190WPackage power time window is 2secShort duration power limit is 220W.Current CPU capability is 170%CPU SVID support EnabledVRM Spread Spectrum DisabledSVID Behaviour Typical ScenarioIA AC and IA DC  load lines to 0.01CPU Load Line Level 5 (not sure this parameter works at all due to set previous ones to 0.01)VT-D enabled (ignore if you don't use virtual machines like VmWare or Virtualbox)VMX enabled (ignore if you don't use virtual machines like VmWare or Virtualbox)Now, I played a lot with core multipliers and voltages and came to these results:Core mutlipliers for 2 first cores: 50Core mutlipliers for another 6 cores: 49Cache multiplier 43AVX offset: 3 (I strongly recommend to put this offset)Voltage: Adaptive (I know, many reviewers and commenters do not like adaptive voltage. I like it.)Adaptive Additional Turbo voltage 1.25Adaptive Offset : +0.015For memory I set XMP I profile (3200Ghz 16-18-18-36 2T)For your system these voltages may not be appropriate, all depends on your die's quality.Also I played a lot with offset for the Adaptive voltage (see below why).Now the system is ready to go.My ambient temperature in room is 22 CTests I used:1/ Prime95 Small FFT non-AVX version.30 minutes with 4900 on all cores.CPU package temp (hottest core as usual): 75 CTotal power to processor according to hwInfo utility: 177W (max)2/ Prime 95 Small FFT AVX version30 minutes with 4600 on all coresCPU package temp (hottest core as usual): 76 CTotal power to processor according to hwInfo utility: 179W (max, though I notices some peaks to 181W rarely)Where I played the most was the Prime95 with AVX enabled.The issue was that some cores stopped intermittenly (one or two cores) during full load (in 5 minutes or even in 15 minutes).The community recommend to increase VCore a bit in that case.In the continuous process of playing with all this I came the above voltages.I suppose I could put 50 to all cores and 3 AVX offset and get 80 C temperatures but I did not do it as I don't like so high temps.Of course, with regular apps and even other stress testing apps like Cinebench, Realbench, Aida or Asus Exteme Tuning Utility you do not get those temps at all.I double you can actually load the processor that hard (16 threads with 100% load) with any regular app. Let alone for so continuous time...Also I tuned my fan curves so they spin at 90% when CPU temp goes upper than 65 C.So at high load even so super silent case like Fractal Design R4 is loud like a rocket.This all makes me conclude that all those talks about loose VRMs on these boards are no more than just talks.Of course I don't know for how long the processor + MB will last in my scenarios but it works nice so far (3 weeks) with regular loads: compilation, photo editing, virtual machines etc.From this point I can compare my old computer (Asus X99-E + 5820k overclocked to 4200Ghz) to this new one.Forgot to mention, by the way, I use NVME Samsung 960 EVO 500Gb drive in my system.On older one I used Samsung 860 EVO 500Gb.Everything runs faster, and works blaze faster on newer PC.The system with 5820k even OCed at 4200 was somewhat meditative at moments (maybe old Win7 OS with bunch of trash slowed it down or what).I will make additions to the review when I will have something to add."", 'Pues el pedido tuvo problemas en la aduana en España, donde me querían cobrar 125€ de sobrecostes. hablé con amazón y el vendedor la verdad que se hizo responsable de todo.

That may very well be since I can\'t actually hold their product and verify for myself, but I\'ll offer an alternative view on this-- The sticker on my box looked exactly like these others\' pictures, and I\'m 100% sure it was not physically tampered with upon close inspection.  In fact, this sticker does NOT even appear to be the multi-layer type of tamper-evident stickers. When I tried to peel the sticker in various ways, all it ever did was tear the underlying paper/cardboard along with it. It seems like this was merely a case of the ""factory sealed"" lettering not being uniformly printed onto the sticker, or possibly even rubbed off of the exterior, and nothing more. (A gentle fingernail scrape wiped away the letters easily for me)', ""Many reviews mention they received a tampered with box. The Made in Vietnam version of this cpu arrives in a box that has it's tamper seal printed backwards -- meaning the paint that is supposed to come off when you rip open the seal is printed on the outside of the seal, so the paint wears out from rubbing against other boxes in shipment and against shipping material, which makes it appear that the box was opened. It however was not and the cpu is brand new. I purchase multiple Intel chips and I noticed this right away after reading the reviews and receiving my cpu with a rubbed out seal too -- if you use your nail you can see that the paint will come right off -- however if you open the seal it will not stay on the box since it is printed on the outside of the seal. Hence, the CPUs are not tampered with, just an issue with how they created those seals. As to the misalignment of the cpu in the box -- this is something that almost always happens in Intel cpus and is not something to be wary of. The CPU i received performs top notch on a z490 motherboard, with 4889 R20 score."", ""I decided to base my new DAW on this processor and I'm glad I did.  Using Cubase 10.5 I am only seeing about 25% of the processor being used at any given time.

That's crazy hot.  That was WITH thermal throttling.I replaced the wimpy cooler with a 150W TDP one.  Telling BIOS that you installed a tower cooler (automatically) raises the TDP to 125W.  No more throttling and never gets above 60C.  (Pretty amazing for a $25 cooler I think.). The fan is inaudible from a foot away.Rendering my projects now takes mere seconds rather than minutes.

My goal was not to build a high-end gaming rig. This computer is not for overclocking either. If you want a gaming rig go build one. If you need something that runs everyday work continue reading. Also, I\'m AMD fan.BUILD SETUP:1. AMD Ryzen 3 3200G with Radeon Graphics APU (4 core CPU with Radeon Graphics). 65 W TDP and max temp 95 C. ($91.95).2. Gigabyte B450 I AORUS PRO WIFI (AMD Ryzen AM4/M.2 Thermal Guard with Onboard Wifi/HDMI/DP/USB 3.1 Gen 2/Mini ITX/Motherboard) ($141.12).3.

InWin Chopin SECC Mini-ITX Tower Case 150W Power Supply with 4 colors stickers inside, Black Aluminum  ($90.34)7. 24"" DisplayPROS:1. The case has an amazing build quality. It feels premium with the black aluminum material. High quality finish and sturdy.2. Small form factor. Quite portable.3. AMD Ryzen 3 3200G is quite powerful for everything you throw at it. The nice part is that it has a built-in Radeon GPU so you can use the motherboard display out to power your displays. It supports 4K. It has 2 HDMI and 1 Display Port!4. Sabrent NVME is incredible. Windows 10 boots in 10-12 sec! Price is unbelievable.5. Built-in WiFi AC with antenna and Bluetooth 5.0. I love motherboards that have those!6. The case comes with 150 PSU. AMD with Radeon is max at 65 W so you wont be running the PSU at max. No noise from PSU and the CPU cooler fan is silent under normal operation.CONS:The case wont fit the AMD Wraith Silent cooler, without a slight modification.SOLUTION:It won\'t fit unless you remove the top bracket. Yes, it can fit!! It took me some time to figure it out and I wanted to share this with everyone. The stock AMD Wraith Silent cooler fits this case after you remove the top bracket from the fan. See pictures and video attached. The benefit is that you don\'t have to buy a separate cooler. I found that Noctua $39.90 is way too much to spend so that pushed me to figure out a solution.Plus the AMD cooler is bigger and since the fan is so close to the side panel. It will force air out of the case through the mesh.EXPERIENCE:Motherboard:The Gigabyte motherboard is incredible. The UEFI BIOS is graphics with mouse support. It came with latest BIOS revision 50 out of the box. Good job Gigabyte! (Hint: if you want to upgrade your BIOS do not do it from Windows. Always do it from the BIOS menu so no bricks). Windows 10 had no issues installing or running. All drivers installed without a problem. Radeon drivers worked out of the box. Also Miracast works on this APU with drivers 20.xx. I was able to wireless cast HDMI to a Anycast dongle and mirror my desktop.Boot time is 10-12 seconds! If your display is on standby and you push the power button by the time the monitor wakes up you\'re at Windows login screen. Unbelievable speed! WiFi and BT are great and coupled with 16 GB of RAM the GPU takes 2 GB and the rest is dedicated to Windows. Performance is great. It also supports Windows secure boot and other gems. Everything is so smooth.CPU Heat:Under idle conditions, the CPU temperature is around 28 C. With load you probably hit 40-50 C. I did not do extensive testing. Remember this is APU based on Zen+ architecture so it\'s not a 7nm APU. Hopefully, we get newer Zen 2 APUs from AMD. I love AMD !Overclocking:I do not do overclocking. My goal is usually to reduce power consumption if possible and have a quite system. The default AMD boost is way more than enough for my needs. I hate when people trash companies and motherboard because of VRM and such. If you want to overclock get a higher end and more expensive motherboard but let us enjoy those gems like the Gigabyte B450 I AORUS PRO WIFI.NOISE:Not so much. See the video. PSU does not make sound either. I tested it by unplugging the CPU fan to see. In fact that this case comes with PSU at this price is so cool. I wish more companies offer that.PERFORMANCE:If you need a computer that does everyday work you wont be disappointed. This setup is quite light and has AMD technologies.

Ich sollte ein Formular mit 6 Fragen ausfüllen und per Mail an Amazon schicken.Die Gutschrift für die CPU wurde abgelehnt weil die Teile angeblich zu spät zurück kamen.Ich kann das absolut nicht verstehen!Werde nicht wieder bei Amazon etwas kaufen.So ein schlechter Service!Jetzt stehe ich ohne Computer da und habe nur teilweise mein Geld wieder zurück.', ""The seller communication is second to none, it was a fast delivery the only problem I had was the product didn't work but the seller was happy for me to send it back for a full refund."", 'Ho aspettato un po\' prima di recensire il prodotto, circa 2 mesi per l\'esattezza, in modo da avere il tempo di valutare effettivamente tutti gli aspetti operativi di questo processore.La mia valutazione è positiva, ovviamente, in quanto si tratta di un buon prodotto potente ed affidabile. Cercherò di mettere per punti gli aspetti che ho valutato.In generale: è una normalissima CPU 6c/6t, con frequenze stock sufficienti per un utilizzo da normale desktop (fin troppo a dire il vero), in turbo boost arriva arriva ad un rispettabile 3.9ghz su tutti i core, che permette di giocare con frame rate superiori ai 60fps in qualunque gioco moderno anche al massimo dei settaggi (ovviamente per avere post, texture e AA al massimo dovete abbinarla almeno ad una 2060/5700); unica percca? stutter frequente in alcuni titoli per via della fluttuazione dei tempi di resa dei fotogrammi, determinati dalla mancanza di hyperthreading. Nulla di insopportabile, ma sicuramente fastidioso.Nella produttività va benissimo, ma tra le offerte ""new gen"" sia di Intel che AMD è sicuramente uno dei processori più scarsi, anche a causa della mancanza di una igpu attiva. Scordatevi di giocare ai titoli AAA al massimo dei settaggi o senza limitare il framerate se volete fare streaming: abbinarla ad una RTX ed usare OBS aiuta ma non è abbastanza.In conclusione direi che per il prezzo che ha (almeno al momento qui in Italia) rispetto alla nettamente superiore R5 3600 è comunque un acquisto da valutare SE e solo SE si è interessati esclusivamente al gaming.Un altro appunto che vorrei fare è quello della compatibilità con futuri upgrade: non ci sono upgrade possibili se si compra Intel, mi spiego meglio: con le Intel 9th gen si ancora il socket LGA1151 che ormai è a fine ciclo, infatti i processori Intel di 10 generazione useranno nuovi socket e nuovi chipset, motivo per il quale o si acquista una scheda madre z390 per fare l\'upgrade ad un i7 o i9 9th gen a distanza di 2 anni o si butta via tutto e si ricomincia da capo.AMD d\'altra parte non solo ha continuato ad usare il suo AM4 anche su Zen 2 ma lo userà ancora sul prossimo refresh ovvero i Ryzen 4000, che presumibilmente spazzeranno via Intel dalla competizione.']"

So I had been looking to upgrade my CPU for a while. Of course the debate came up if Ryzen was better or if Intel should even be considered. I'll admit, I still like Intel in my heart, but I wasn't getting 11th Gen, its expensive for basically no more performance. But the 10850k had come out just in the last year, for less than the 10900k but with the same performance. Mix that with it being cheaper with the 11th Gen announcements, and there being great looking and performing mobos for it (and 11th Gen) I bought this.Honestly, I gotta say, it does what it promises. It has 10 cores that can run like a beast. It has my 2080 Super performing at its best without the sweat and strain my 7700k had to. I had to push that 7700k to 5.2 Ghz, where I could feel it straining, to really see RTX gaming performance at its smoothest above 1080p. This 10850k boosted just from the base BIOS on my mobo to 4.8Ghz on all 10 cores and things are buttery smooth. I play Control at 1440p with maxed settings and get a fairly consistent 90 FPS and my temps and component usage are all nice and ideal levels. I was able to play Half-Life Alyx, and stream it while capturing my webcam footage without any temp issues and honestly hitting my VRAM cap on the GPU before any actual performance issues from bottlenecking.Honestly, I can't be happier with this purchase. I hate reviews without negatives, it feels fake. And I wish I had some, but seriously it is playing games I enjoyed before with far better performance at higher settings. It is handling my crazed multitasking and occasional streaming without a sweat. Ryzen 5000 series may be able to squeeze some better gaming performance overall than this. But at the price I got it, and the issues with availability of a 5800x (which is more expensive too) I couldn't say I'd be happier with that. Especially when the AMD motherboards don't look quite as nice either. My friend has a 5800x, I've played on his machine and heard from him in his own use that its good, but nothing there seemed to blow this 10850k out of the water."", 'Performed above expectations', 'I went from a 5820k to this beast... all I can say is WOW.The research I did indicated that this is basically Intel\'s flagship CPU, but a half of a small step down.One thing I didn\'t know about my 5820k was how much it was holding my entire system back.Passmark Benchmarks increased for EVERY component. My 5 year old RAM is now running in the 99th percentile. My 2070 Super isn\'t bottlenecked. Heck, even my crappy old SSD improved... but then was mercilessly replaced by an younger, sexier, far more modern NVME drive (hey, if you\'re going big, go BIG).Super happy with this. It\'s worth every penny. I\'m still scratching my head as to how I paid less for this than my 5820k, and I bought that when they weren\'t even second gen anymore... and this is first gen hardware... but I supposed I can thank AMD for that... it helps when a ""little brother"" competitor suddenly outclasses you for less than you are charging... but hey, that works for us Intel fanboys, so we can get our fix for cheaper!!Only con is that under load, it kicks all my fans/cooling into high gear... but still runs butter smooth in most applications. Most of what I do primarily uses the GPU, but having a proper CPU matched to it makes a huge difference in all 3D applications I use. For reference, I\'ve got it hooked up with a Corsair h100i radiator system, which seems to do the job well of cooling it.

I figured all was good until I tried to actually put it in the socket. It was too big and the notches on the board were not in the correct location to lock into the socket. I ended damaging one pin in the socket. Went to BestBuy and purchased the exact same processor that drops perfectly into the socket. I have sent it back and requested a refund. I fail to see how something like this could happen accidentally. I'm not sure what they sent but it certainly isn't an i9 10850 for a LGA 1200 socket.Update: My brother did some research and found a picture online from a BestBuy customer who had the same problem. The notches were not in the correct place so it appears that this a a supplier problem and not an Amazon mistake."", ""Excellent performance from this CPU - to say that it can cope with anything that's thrown at it is an understatement.

There is already plenty of information, benchmarks, etc. on the web detailing the performance of this chip and/or chips that are similar. Ultimately, I\'m hoping to present a little clarification regarding what one may expect to receive when purchasing this item.So, if the headline of this review has caught your attention it may have been because you noticed the product description states that it ""doesn\'t"" come with a thermal solution (AKA:  heat-sink/fan). However, like some other reviewers/commenters have stated, ""it does""! (or at least mine did). The item I received was in retail form and included the stock heat-sink and fan (case badge and all). I\'ve come across similar dependencies on other retail sites claiming the same thing. Sad to state, purchasing this item felt like more of a gamble if anything.Does that guarantee the one you purchase will include one...Don\'t know! But it may minimize the reluctance to purchase it seeing that myself, including others, have had the same experience and can confirm that the item received was indeed a retail variant.All in all, if it comes down to it, it is a relativity inexpensive chip. Even though potentially receiving one without a thermal solution may not be all that desirable, many aftermarket solutions can be found on the web and are rather cost effective when dealing with a chip of this type. So, the $10 or less region may not be out of line for an adequate thermal solution. Just think of your possible usage scenarios and buy accordingly (if it would even come to that).I bought this knowing it may not have come with a cooler, so I can\'t state I would\'ve felt burned getting one without one.  ""5 Stars"" for exceeding my expectations!Best of luck!', ""This processor isn't much to write home about. It is a 2 core/4 thread processor near the bottom of the 10th-Gen Intel product stack. I say that not to criticize it, but rather, to ensure I'm setting the proper expectation for someone reading a 5 star review for the cheapest latest-generation processor.As long as this processor is appropriate for what you're buying it for, it's a great choice and a pretty reasonable price. What is it appropriate for? In my case, I used it to build a pfSense router/firewall machine. It works great for this, with 3% to 5% CPU load under heavy usage. It would also be appropriate for a Windows machine that you intend to use for things like web browsing, Netflix or light productivity work (checking email, word processing, or similar). in fact, it's a great choice for those tasks.Where you'll be less happy would be something like gaming. If this is your entry point in to Windows gaming, I highly recommend spending a little more for something like a Core i3 10100. You could comfortably use the same motherboard as this processor, but it has double the cores and higher clock speeds.Additionally, if you're doing something that requires a little extra graphics power, the integrated GPU in this processor won't get you very fine. It's fine for the things I mentioned above.... For example, it will play 4K Netflix or YouTube with no problem... But even the most casual game would bring this to its knees. If you're dead set on a processor with integrated graphics, I'd recommend looking to team red (e.g. Athlon 3000G, Ryzen 3 3200G).One side note: I distinctly remember the product listing indicating this did not come with a heatsink/fan. That is incorrect. The product I received did include a standard Intel in-box cooler."", ""To feel good about this purchase, you need to be an informed consumer. I would only buy this for very specific use cases. In my case, I put this in a low power home server more focused on storage and serving media (Plex) than virtualization. I think it would also be perfect for a basic home/office PC that's focused on browsing the internet and using Microsoft Office.This should not be purchased for gaming or other use cases that benefit from lots of CPU horsepower (i.e. Adobe Creative Cloud, etc).For me? The price was low. The power consumption was low. The feature set was right (it's great for transcoding video in hardware via Plex).If you're not sure, I would probably save yourself the potential disappointment and set my low bar at the Intel i3-10100.Recommended."", ""I wanted to take this review to directly address those thinking of purchasing for gaming, as I haven't seen too many reviews about this.For the value, this CPU is insanely good, but you must know what kind of games you want to play before you pull the trigger. It is a 2-core, 4-thread CPU which is the equivalent of what older gen i3 CPU's were. It is very snappy for browsing & basic needs, but how does it handle in-game? Here's my experience.

You can probably push higher frame-rates with even just a 10th gen i3. However, if you are on a budget, or you don't care much about having the most consistent frames in the world, this CPU is a killer value. I, for one, learned an important lesson with this CPU. Stop caring about the frames, and just enjoy the games. Even still, the performance this CPU can push on a healthy PC build is beyond acceptable. It is not a AAA game crushing chip, but it will play a lot of games from 2015 onwards perfectly fine.""]"

Under load, the CPU can top out at 80C+ at stock with power limits removed and MCE disabled, but that is only when running AVX-heavy benchmarks like Cinebench R15, with a 30C ambient and an NZXT Kraken X63 280MM AIO inside my NZXT H510 case, which has notoriously poor airflow. When gaming, however, the temperature hardly, if ever, go above 70C, mostly hovering in the high-50s to low-60s range.

I used this cpu to run console emulation and it does very well, I think it could do ok to run ps4 emulation but I hadn\'t tried it. Most games seem to run a bit faster than usual though, this can be a concern if you play games where you need quick timing/reaction speed like in first person shooters.

Nutshell is if Microsoft thinks you are running a game it switches to the X3D cache otherwise it uses the frequency optimized chiplet.

I wanted to narrow it down so I didn't have to wait weeks for the turn around of each part.Finally I saw a new BIOs from ASUS.1410 is the newest I am using but both this version and 1303 claim to limit SOC voltage to 1.3 which should mitigate the shutdowns and possible damage.I really do love this chip and the X3D really is amazing in gaming. Really removes the lower .01 and 1% frame rates.I'm totally happy with the performance and am playing with per core curve optimizer.

Only use the iGPU at the moment, no graphics card"", 'der Lüfter ist extrem leise zumindest in der normalem Belastungsphase, noch habe ich nicht alles eingerichtet, um eine realistische Gaming-Aussage machen zu können', ""First off, I enjoy building SFF (small form factor) type builds.The current generation of CPU's were more power hungry, which resulted in more heat to dissipate. Trying to cool a Ryzen 9 7900X on a CPU cooler rated for max 100W is quite difficult, so therefore you have to go towards cases like the NZXT H1 V2.This particular chip allows you to not only have near identical performance to the Ryzen 9 7900X with PBO, but also gives you SFF allowable performance at a lower wattage that still provides you power.So far today using this has been great, and I recommend this chip to anyone that wants a newer generation chip without the abismal power draws that have been required as of late.Edit 1/17:From normal use I have seen no difference between this model and the X model. I had both chips in my NZXT H1 V2, liquid metal as the thermal application, and by far the non X model does much better in this type of SFF build. It still will boost, however if you are like me, work from home, and use this all day long in most cases, you aren't going to want the CPU blasting at full power over the entire work day.Quick note: temps are much better, my fan curve was not changed and the temperature is a lot more tolerable compared to the X version, so my CPU radiator fan does not spool up as much as it did with the X. I let it hover between 50C-65C for daily use and the fans are quiet, with the X the fan was at half or more RPM constantly to keep it at around this temperature and would sometimes hover in the 70's. So, if you are temperature concious then the non-x version is great.With that said I am pleased with the product. I do feel though this model needed to be priced at $399, as we have seen the 7900X is selling at this time around $425 on sale.Again, I will reiterate, the allowances in this chip should have been more prevalent in the X version, as I feel like we were kind of ripped off slightly this generation on CPU's and GPU's.Edit 1/20:This will be my final edit. I am boosting to around 5.5 MHz with the wattage anywhere from 60-90W. My temperatures are sustaining on load no more than 68C on a single 140mm AIO in the NZXT H1 V2. This is great, I am maintaining the frequency, but with a much lower power draw.One item I would recommend is getting an aftermarket chip mounting plate for this chip, weirdly it did make a difference for this chip, around 1-2C lower than the stock MOBO chip mount. I'm using the following mount: Thermalright ASF-Black AM5 CPU Holder, Corrective Anti-Bending Fixing Frame, AM5 Full-fit Fixed Non-Marking Mounter, AM5 Anti-Bending Contact Frame, CPU Cooler Standard, I am also using the following paste: Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut Thermal Grease - 1 Gram Set + 3 Applicators + Pads - Liquid Metal Thermal Paste for Cooling The CPU, GPU Value Pack.So far so good, would recommend, and again this is what the first chip should have been - AMD is trying too much to be intel, sure make your server chips, but we buy AMD for efficiency, not brute power in most cases. Sure, there is threadripper, but most of us are casual users. Regardless, this is the chip we all wanted, it's powerful, efficient, and over-clockable."", 'I like the low TDP of these, only 65W and whopping 49k Passmark benchmark score with 12 cores and 24 threads!

Anche stressandolo per mezz'ora con tutti i core in funzione al 100% con Cinelerra (elaborazione video) la temperatura massima è di 70° C stabile.La temperatura durante il normale lavoro di ufficio si attesta sui 34-40 °C anche perché i core vengono sfruttati  con basse percentuali (la maggior parte inferiore al 10%).Non ha un chip grafico integrato per cui richiede una scheda grafica a parte o integrata sulla scheda madre.L'ho montata su una Gigabyte B450M S2H con i soliti dovuti accorgimenti:- non toccare con le dita la pasta termica che è già piazzata sulla base del dissipatore;- non toccare con le dita la superficie della CPU (altrimenti il grasso presente sulle dita riduce la dissipazione. Se succede pulirla con un detergente a base di ammoniaca, ideale solo acqua distillata e ammoniaca, lasciando asciugare il tutto);- stare attenti a come posizionare la ventola: in alcune piastre madri la parte più sporgente della ventola va a interagire nello spazio dove installare la ram, per cui è da piazzare girandola di 180° ovvero tale sporgenza deve essere dalla parte opposta della Ram. inoltre nelle piastre madri, come riportato sulle istruzioni, prima del posizionamento della ventola sono da rimuovere i due supporti laterali per la vecchia serie di CPU AMD. Infine avvitare sempre incrociando, cioè avvitando due viti opposte per alcuni giri e poi facendo lo stesso per le altre due fino a completo serraggio: in tal modo non si ha lo spostamento della pasta durante il serraggio dovuto alla leggera inclinazione del dissipatore causata dal serraggio delle viti prima da un lato e poi dall'altro andando ad inficiare poi le capacità di raffreddamento."", 'Ottimo processore per una build low budget.Associato ad una 1650 super, si gioca tranquillamente a warzone senza temperature elevate o qualsivoglia problema.Consigliato dopo parecchio tempo di utilizzo.', 'Ich betreibe den Ryzen 3 3100 in einem Asus TUF-Gaming B550M mit einem älteren Thermalright-Kühler und 24 GB RAM (DDR4-3000). Die CPU lässt sich problemlos auf 4400 MHz übertakten, wofür ich die Core-Spannung (VID) im Bios auf ca. 1,3 Volt anheben musste. Dabei wurde der Prozessor bei Stress-Tests allerdings mit 76 Grad etwas warm und verbrauchte auch ca. 75 Watt.Ich betreibe ihn daher mit nur 4300 MHz. Bei dieser Taktrate begnügt er sich mit 1,2 Volt Core-Spannung (ich habe dazu die Offset-Spannung im Asus-Bios auf +0,75 V gestellt) und verbraucht unter Last nur ca. 55 Watt.Zum Tempo: Bereits bei 4300 MHz erreicht der Ryzen 3 3100 mit dem Testprogramm Cinebench 15 knapp über 11.000 Punkte. Das ist kaum weniger als der auf 4,9 GHz übertaktete Intel i5-9600KF in meinem Hauptrechner. Grund ist, dass der Ryzen 3 3100 acht Threads hat (4 reale Kerne und 4 simulierte SMT), während die Intel-CPU nur 6 Threads hat (6 reale Kerne, kein Hyperthreading).Im Single-Thread-Modus hat der Ryzen 3 3100 bei 4300 MHz eine Rechenleistung, die rund 12 % unter der Single-Thread-Rechenleistung des Intel 9600KF liegt. Dies gleicht der Ryzen jedoch mit seinen 8 Threads wieder aus, wenn er mit Multithread-Programmen gefordert wird. Es ist daher keine Übertreibung, dass sich der kleine Ryzen mit den rund doppelt so teuren Intel-Boliden aus 2019 messen kann.Ein Nachteil ist, dass der Ryzen 3 3100 bei Übertaktung auf 4300 MHz (dazu hab ich im Bios des obigen Mainboards den Multiplikator auf 43 gestellt) IMMER bei diesem Tempo läuft, und auch die Corespannung wird nicht runtergeregelt. Sprich: ""Cool and Quiet"" funktioniert in dieser Konstellation nicht. Das führt allerdings zu keinem nennenswerten Mehrverbrauch. Idle ziehen die Kerne zusammen ca. 5 Watt (übertaktet). Unübertaktet sind es ca. 3 Watt. Den meisten Strom verbraucht idle - in beiden Fällen - die SOC-Einheit (ca. 16 Watt, gemessen mit HWInfo64).Fazit: Zum Preis von 95 Euro (Amazon-Preis): Volle Kaufempfehlung. Der ""bessere"" Ryzen 5 3600 war mir mit 170 Euro aufwärts zu teuer. Da warte ich lieber, bis Zen3 rauskommt und rüste das Mainboard dann nächstes Jahr ggfs. weiter auf.

Getting a 4 core 8 threaded cpu for this money is superb (I paid £95), and it is an excellent performer. Even RDR2 chugs along nicely at 60fps with medium to high settings. My I7 7700k cost over £300 3 years ago and the performance isn't far behind it.There are a couple of things to note when building a PC with this chip. It has no onboard gpu so you will need a discreet graphics card otherwise you will not get a display. Secondly I initially had issues getting the new build to post. I turned the power on and the fans powered up but that was it. Luckily have built a few pc's and thought this was a RAM issue. So I pulled out the sticks from slots 1and 3 and tried 2 and 4. Still no luck. I then put a single stick of ram in slot 2 and it posted. I then installed windows, shut the pc down and installed both sticks in their dual config and hey presto all worked fine. I did have a further problem as the I could not get the ram to work at it's designated 3200mhz, I had to settle for 3000mhz, though I'm sure a bios update would solve this.An included cpu cooler is also nice to see, and it works just fine, though if you like to overclock a beefier solution is recommended.

It claimed to run overclocked at 5.7 ghz. I wanted the fastest best chip. All other CPUs I ever bought from AMD had the overclocking unlocked. This one was not and the software from AMD said it could NOT be unlocked due to the 3D feature. So, it's sold as running at 5.7 ghz, but the software they released says it can't, I couldn't get it to, and my computer shop wasn't able to. I put all that in just for anyone that will say I simply don't know what I'm doing. I called AMD. I wrote them. I read their website and articles. It runs at 4.2, which is barely a little faster than my previous AMD cpu from 2012. 4.2 is much slower than 5.7. They also promised a free Star Wars game with it, but AMD didn't honor the promotion. Within a couple of weeks of selling it to me at the insanely high price, they were discounting it as much as $130. So, I felt stupid for trusting them. I will say, it does run fine. I was able to upgrade to Windows 11 and I do run Starfield with it. Ironically, the only software I had any trouble running came from AMD itself. I'm using it fine with an expensive motherboard, 64GB RAM and an AMD 12GB graphics card. Other than overclocking or getting it to run any faster than 4.2 ghz, I have had no problems with this processor. But since 4.0 processors have been out well over a decade, this is way too much to pay for a 4.2 one. If anyone at AMD or anywhere else actually gets this processor running at 5.7 ghz, I still overpaid, but I'd at least be happier with the purchase. I've got lots of computers and you'd think they'd want happy customers. I've always chosen AMD because of their price, warranty and customer service, but this time it's not broken, so it's not a warranty replacement issue. According to their own software, it can't be unlocked which means it's not designed to EVER really run at 5.7. Too bad nearly every place that sells it still claims that it does, including AMD's website. Like I said, even my overpaid computer techs could not get it to run anywhere near the OC speed. On the other hand that meant it has never overheated, but this could also be because I overpaid for the best water cooling system. There's no game or app my previous cpu liked that isn't better on this one. I hope AMD reads this, gives me the free game, and makes their software and processor work as their website claims. If they do those things, well, it's still too expensive to get all the stars. I was too generous with my money as well as with the stars in this review. But it does run my computer and it does that well. It just doesn't run nearly as fast, isn't running the Star Wars game because they didn't keep their promise and cost way too much. Oh, I also thought the customer service person was rude at AMD, unlike Amazon who are usually super nice. I could give you all the technical details, but others have done that. I told you what matters to me, a nearly lifelong AMD fanboy."", ""People bought the overpriced $450 7800X3D and thought it was a good deal, no. That thing has only 8 cores and can't run background task like video exporting, ... while you are video gaming. Also, that one is not great for working. How about spending $100 more for this beast and get both a gaming and working machine with a 16 core monster that are capable of multitasking? I bought this thing for $557 and it came with the Premium edition of Starfield that cost $100. What can I ask for more? The 7950X3D is the best. You can game and open multiple browser tabs, run video editing task in the background without worrying. Just run process lasso when playing video game to move the game to ccd cores. Be sure to equip 64GB memory for it. Why? It has 16 cores, 32 threads. Each thread should have 2GB on paper. Why equip 32GB for a 32 thread chip?

I don't think high temperatures will be a problem for this particular chip, at least not outside what the rest of the 7000 series family can hit.I personally haven't had any stability concerns with this processor in the 3 weeks that I have ran it in place of my 7700x, even with EXPO enabled. In terms of average framerate, this chip feels like a 7700x subjectively, as I have no issues getting frames to a 4090 that I can tell. The 3d cache helps with 1%/.1% lows, to the point that the majority of the micro stutters I had gotten from my 7700x are largely gone in gameplay. There may be a small stutter when swapping from a game to a non game on another screen if using AMD's recommended config, but not enough to be a bother.Overall, if you want to mess around with extra cores later on (streaming, encode, etc.) but want the 3dcache for games now AND your budget allows for it, the 7950X3D is a pretty solid pick in my book for the enthusiast who wants the best without heading into server CPU territory.PC specs relevant to review:Asus ROG Crosshair x670E Extreme (with ElecGear contact frame, BIOS 1415)Gskill Trident Z5 Neo 32gb ddr5 6000 CL30 (EXPO)DeepCool Lt720 360mm radiatior (stock fans with unit, KPX compound)Gigabyte RTX 4090 gaming OC""]"

All of my computers run shared scientific jobs under the BOINC model so all machines are pushed pretty hard. I\'m glad to say that these CPU\'s cores run relatively coolly with 16 efficiency cores running at 100% saturation full time and the temperatures are in the 70-80C range which is fantastic given that the efficient Shuttle cooling system does it all via a little 3"" fan, some fancy heat pipes and heat exchanger and does so quite quietly.

However, this 13900ks is a lot snappier even browsing around in windows 11. Programs launch faster and games are buttery smooth @ 4k ultra details, when paired with an Nvidia 4090. I also love the fact that the ks is a “binned” CPU, which overclocks more easily and typically handles faster DDR5 memory in the range of 7800-8400Mhz depending on how good the memory controller is in your 13900ks sample. Regardless, you will probably be able to hit 7800-8000 at the least. This purchase is actually my 2nd 13900ks and I ended up getting a better binned version this time. With an overal(Asus) SP of 113, P Cores 123, e cores 93, and memory controller was 83. Im currently running a G.Skill 32GB(2x16GB) 7800mhz DDR5 kit with XMP turned on in the BIOS. I have been able to bump it up to a stable 8000mhz by bumping up the Memory Controller voltage to 1.4v and the VDD/VDDQ voltage to 1.5v using the same timings that were on my 7800 XMP kit CL36. With the CPU and a Corsair h170i 420mm AIO with 6 fans in a push pull configuration, I was able to get a stable CPU overclock of 60/60/58/58/58/58/58/58 on the (8) P cores, but I’m pretty sure I can bump the 1-3 core workloads higher. It’s when using a workload that requires all 8 P cores that I run into some stability issues with my current cooling trying to push it past 5.8Ghz using all 8 p cores. I leave my E cores all synced at 4.3Ghz stock to help give me more P core Overclock headroom. Another overclock method that works really well, is easy and stable, is to turn on the Asus AiOverclock. Given that I have used both an MSI and Asus Z790 motherboard, I highly recommend the Asus ROG brand line for a Z790 compatible motherboard for this 13900ks. They update their BIOS version frequently and there quality is typically very good on there products that are produced in higher numbers. The absolute ideal motherboard for Overclocking and using the fastest DDR5 ram would be the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 APEX(2-DIMM) motherboard. If you just can’t get your hands on one maybe go with the (4-DIMM) Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Hero motherboard. You should be able to reach up to 7600mhz DDR5 on it. Whatever you do don’t settle on a motherboard, because it’s the center of the system and can be upgraded later. I started with an MSI Meg Z790 Ace and wish I had started with an Asus. The MSI ran a lot hotter with the same clock speeds and only supported up to 7200mhz DDR5 using 2x16GB sticks. The motherboard attached in the review photo is the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 APEX, a thermal Grizzly 12/13th gen contact frame to make the cpu more level for the heatsink cooler that goes on top and of course the 13900ks that’s a little dirty from previously applied thermal paste I just wiped off.

With all the cores running, they will run up to 100 C and throttle back on clock speed with pretty much any standard CPU cooler.  The consensus seems to be that this is limited by the thermal connection inside the CPU case between the actual chip and the upper surface which contacts your cooling block.  In other words, the cores can overheat even if your cooling system can maintain the upper surface of the CPU at room temperature.  You don't want the cores running hot at 99 C for any length of time, and so you really need to tune the CPU clock speed and the voltages with a motherboard that permits overclock tuning.

L\'installazione non è stata delle più semplici a causa delle dimensioni delle varie dentature leggermente sballata. Ho preferito effettuare il procedimento di installazione del cuscinetto prima di ""poggiare"" la cpu all\'interno del soket, onde evitare che eventuali tentativi/errori durante la fase di incollaggio (tra l\'altro l\'adesivo è veramente forte) potessero ripercuotersi, in qualsiasi modo, su parti delicate (pins).A parte tutto questo, questi i cuscinetti sembrano svolgere abbstanza bene la loro funzione (ossia prevenire l\'accumulo di pasta termica nelle caratteristiche dentatature presenti sugli heatspreader delle cpu ryzen 7000).', ""I put one on my AM5 CPU.  I wanted to do it out of the CPU socket, but it instructs to do it while in there so I took my time with it.  Removed a little of the backing off a corner, then slowly worked my way around while holding the CPU in place so it didn't shift if I had to pull or push on areas that weren't where they needed to be.  It takes a bit of patience, and you can't expect perfection from things as flimsy as this.  But what it does offer seems a heck of a lot better than nothing, and risking thermal paste getting where it shouldn't be.My one gripe is one of the three you get, had the backing peel off in transport and it got stuck to the instructions.  So I lost one right off the bat.  Didn't realize it until I'd installed this one with a new liquid cooler.  It would be smart to ship these with something more rigid to keep them from getting ruined before the customer even receives it.  I've included a picture of what I mean.Overall this gets a general thumbs up.  Just take your time with applying it, and if you have something small, and plastic, that may help manipulate particularly stubborn areas into place."", ""So, to be clear, once installed, its snug and does its job. Doesn't interfere with closing the clamp, fills the spaces nicely, and sits below the IHS.THAT SAIDThe instructions are completely stupid. Once the sticky tape is pulled on the bottom, it is very difficult to place on the CPU WITHOUT making a mistake and pulling the CPU out of the socket - which I did, and ALMOST dropped it. If it had landed on the PINS, game over. Basically, it sticks to the CPU and your fingers at the same time.Best advice - apply the guard to the CPU OUT of the socket, get it to fit properly and snug, make sure you carefully clean the CPU bottom thoroughly with 90% alcohol or above (as you likely will have man handled the CPU by then) and let dry. When it is dry, and the CPU now has the guard applied, you can safely place it in the socket."", ""The real gem here is the peace of mind. If you're using liquid metal, this guard is a no-brainer. It lets you reap the benefits of liquid metal without worry. Thermal Grizzly has delivered a top-tier product and backed it up with stellar customer service. Can't recommend it enough. A solid five-star product!"", 'Gute Idee Umsetzung aber etwas blöd man muss die Kleber entfernen und dann etwas dran ziehen damit man es über die CPU bekommt dadurch klebt die Teile an der CPU und lassen sich nicht ausrichten nach den 2 Versuch habe ich sie weg gelassen', 'Ich verstehe den Sinn hinter dem ""CPU Guard"", aber die Passform hat bei mir nicht so richtig hingehauen. Hätte da für den Preis ein bisschen mehr erwartet.', 'Erfüllen ihren Zweck. Ist halt ein einweg Produkt. Gibt meiner Ansicht nach inzwischen bessere Lösungen.', 'The only thing to note is that the guard is really flexible. I used tweezers to apply and ensure a snug fit. The stretchy features helped a good seal surrounding the chip. Works great.']"

Erledigt alles zuverlässig 😊', 'I decided to go ahead and build a new PC for Christmas. I wanted the 5800X, but I have not been able to procure one, so I settled on the 3800XT. Coming from an i7-7700K, a whole heck of a lot has changed. AMD actually did a pretty good job extracting the most performance possible out of the silicon from TMSC\'s 7nm fab process. Pair this CPU with a quality motherboard and DDR4-3600 CL16 RAM (Crucial Ballistix is excellent for the money and over-clockable), set the infinity fabric and memory data rate to 1800-1900MHz in a 1:1 ratio, tighten the timings using the Ryzen memory timing calculator and pretty much leave everything else on auto. You will get excellent performance, see significant latency improvements, and you can also experiment with the PBO settings and under-volting to see what works best. This is actually much closer to Intel\'s offerings for gaming than pundits claim, especially with the newer AGESA BIOS firmware. And for productivity and power efficiency, AMDs Ryzen chips are the reigning champs.For single thread performance, I am scoring 569 in the CPU-Z bench and nearly 6,000 for the multi-threaded benchmark. For reference, my massively overclocked i7-7700K was only slightly lower for single thread, but considerably less than half of the 3800XT\'s multi-threaded score. I am very impressed. I am also not having any temperature issues, using the Be Quiet Dark Rock 4 heatsink and a -100 mV under-volt offset., which gives me about 32 degrees C idle temp and around 60-65 degrees C under 100% load. Be aware that under-volting may impact your CPU\'s performance. I noticed that my multi-threaded bench scores went down with an under-volt, but my single-thread scores went up with an under-volt, which is fine for me since I am mostly gaming, I will sacrifice a bit of multi-threaded performance for better single-thread performance. Also, I tried various PBO settings, none of which improved my particular chip\'s performance. I suspect the 3800XT on the latest silicon from TSMC is already optimized, hence PBO did not help me. Make sure to install the latest AMD chipset drivers and select an AMD Ryzen power plan for Windows. I am currently using the ""AMD Ryzen Balanced Power Plan"", but the performance plan is good for another 1-2% performance at the expense of power consumption.I have 2 cores that can hit 4.725 GHz (#0 and #3), with 4 cores routinely hitting a bit over 4.6 GHz and the other 2 typically around 4.55 GHz. During a long-running, multi-threaded load, I am seeing about 4.5 GHz on average across all cores, which I think is very good. Some have questioned the value proposition of the 3800XT since it is more expensive and does not come with a stock Wraith cooler, but it was worth it to me for the better boost clocks and massively improved single thread performance (~4-9% faster than the 3700X/3800X for light workloads thanks to the 4.7+ GHz boost, maybe 2-3% for heavy workloads.)I am very happy with this chip so far and definitely recommend it if you are switching over from Intel or a first gen Ryzen and you cannot get yours hands on the newer 5000 series Ryzen chips. This CPU works great for both gaming and productivity, and uses far less power than an i7-10700K or i9-10850K, which I had considered but I like AMD\'s PCIE4 support and upgrade path better than Intel\'s.CPU: AMD 3800XTMB: Asus Prime X570-ProRAM: 64 GB Crucial Ballistix DDR4-3600 @ 1900 MHz (DDR-3800) 16-18-18-38, 1:1 with infinity fabricVC: Gigabyte 5700XT OC (2nd gen)PS: Corsair RMX750Case: Corsair 750DDrives: Multiple Samsung 860/970 SSDs (2.5"" and NVME M.2)OS: Windows 10 ProCPU-Z Score: https://valid.x86.fr/bench/mxru2m/1', 'Claramente es un procesador muy muy bueno para todo, y va a poder tirar de todas las gráficas del momento y de las nuevas, pero también tiene sus desventajas.Solo ponerla a funcionar ya te das cuenta al poner hwmonitor, hwinfo o el mismo ryzen master de que 1,45 y 1,48v en los test de estres (y en muchas situaciones de baja carga también navegando por windows o internet) no es algo cercano a normal, claramente es un límite demasiado alto el que coge por defecto amd para este micro, por lo que queda descartado para alguien que no entienda de bios, oc, undervolt, etc.En mi caso al trastear, he conseguido buenas cifras dejándolo a 4,4ghz a 1.2250V y bajándole 10 grados (puedo llegar a 4,5ghz a 1.35V, pero no merece la pena por que sube mucho el calor y ganas poco), lo que lo deja actualmente en 72º en test de estres a tope, cosa que será un horno en verano si lo dejo así (mi criorig h5 universal no da para mas, ya está viejo xD), así que tocará tirar de una refrigeración de aire de las mas top ya que no me gustan las líquidas, pero igualmente sabía que tarde o temprano tendría que cambiar mi disipación ya que tiene bastantes años, por lo que para mi no es un problema.El problema de agesa y sus versiones me las podré evitar, ya que mi msi krait gaming x370 está muerta en actualizaciones hace ya bastante y tiene pinta que se va a quedar así, por lo que un quebradero de cabeza menos mientras dure la placa, pero para el que tenga alguna mas top de las 450 en adelante y estén todavía actualizando, como dicen los compañeros, se convertirá en una ruleta de voltages y de cambios en la bios cada vez que se actualice, así que tenedlo en cuenta.Por lo demás es un bicho y tira de todo, pero hay que dejarla fina y olvidarse de esos tan bien sonantes 4,7ghz en 1 núcleo, ya que se sacrifica bastante y un voltage tan alto de stock no puede ser bueno para la vida del procesador.Dejo el tocho informativo y me despido, saludos a todos y espero que ayude a quien se lo plantee comprar.P.D. amazon si pensabas bajar 15€ después de 1 semana de haberlo comprado, avisa co** xD.', ""Riscrivo la mia recensione dopo quasi 6 mesi di utilizzo:Che dire, ancora soddisfattissimo, soprattutto perchè in questo tempo ho avuto modo di conoscere meglio le qualità di questo processore, e posso dire che il suo massimo potenziale lo raggiunge in Overclock, in particolare consiglio il programma CTR di 1usmus, dove viene applicato un OC ibrido su single e multi core, con voltaggi che si adattano al carico, il mio processore è particolarmente buono e riesce a tenere stabilmente 4550 Mhz su tutti gli 8 core con 1.36V (ottimo per i giochi, chi impegano massimo un 50% della CPU), mentre con settaggi più conservativi (che si attivano ad esempio durante un render pesante) tiene 4425 Mhz con 1.25V. Ovviamente rinnovo il consiglio di avere un impianto di raffredamento potente, perchè comunque scalda.Il mio consiglio finale quindi è di non comprare questo processore se intendete lasciarlo stock, perchè i miglioramenti rispetto ad un 3700x sono trascurabili, e il boost stock AMD (ma anche dei vari tools delle schede madri tipo ASUS performanche enhancer, che ho provveduto a disattivare una volta capito che non serviva a nulla se non consumare di più) utilizzano veramente voltaggi killer (con conseguenti consumi e temperature elevate) per ottenere delle frequenze ''basse'' (su cinebench raggiunge 4375 Mhz all core applicando un'insensato 1.389V, come ho detto prima con un OC manuale si raggiungono frequenza più alte con voltaggi molto più bassi).Discorso molto simile sul single core, i 4.7 Ghz vengono raggiunti (e anche leggermente superati) da stock, però con voltaggi mooolto vicini agli 1.5V, mentre con CTR per raggiungere 4.725 Ghz su carichi molto leggeri si usano 1.45V, volore decisamente più sensato.Tirando le somme quindi:Se fate OC manuale o volete provare CTR di 1usmus cosigliatissimo, se non avete intenzione di metterci le mani andate di 3700x e rispiarmiate dei soldi. Perchè un 3700x e non uno della serie 5000? Semplice, con i soldi risparimiati e una piccola aggiunta ci comprate un monitor 1440p, ed ecco che come per magia vi troverete un processore che va uguale (in game) ma avete 2 core in più rispetto ad un 5600x con relativo margine di utilizzo per il futuro (e in produttività)! Ragionate, non fermativi ai puri benchamrk fatti con una 3090 in 1080p e dettagli medi, nella realtà le differenze fra i processori per chi non fa un utilizzo lavorativo sono moooolto minori"", 'Mit dem 3800 XT habe ich mittlerweile die 3. CPU aus der 3000 er Serie nach 3800X, 3900X und nun 3800XT.Ich darf jetzt kurz erklären: mein 3800X liegt an der obersten Grenze der Leistungsstreuung, lockere 4500 Mhz Takt bei 1.35 V, 3800Mhz RAM mit 16 er Latenzen, mein 3900X ist eher eine durchschnittliche CPU mit max 4350 MHZ und max. 3600 Mhz RAM mit 14er Latenzen.Zum Vergleich mit dem 3800XT: Ich habe lange gewartet bis ich, eigentlich aus Neugier, eine XT Cpu gekauft habe, schlussendlich habe ich 15 € mehr bezahlt als für den X damals - was für mich OK ist.Out of the Box zum normalen X war in meinem System kein Unterschied festzustellen, kein einziger Test oder Benchmark hatte eine Abweichung die nicht unter Messtoleranz fällt.Die ersten Unterschiede werden mit AMD`s PBO erkennbar - der XT taktet dann nämlich auf einzelnen Kernen bis auf 4,9 GHZ ! Allerdings bringt das nur dem bewundernden Betrachter von HW Info etwas den die Leistungsspitzen liegen immer genau am Ende eines Benchmarks an - genau genommen in der ersten Sekunde wenn der Benchmark vorbei ist - bringt Leistungstechnisch also nichts ! Beim Manuellen Einstellen des Taktes funktioniert das gleiche was beim X auch funktioniert UND es lassen sich sogar noch 50 Mhz drauf legen - ich konnte also 4550 MhZ all Core stabil ( Prime 95) einstellen - beim Ram 3600 mit 14er Latenzen - es scheint somit eine eher durchschnittliche CPU zu sein denn man liest ja von teilweise 4,7 GhZ all Core Prozessoren.Wie auch immer: egal ob 4,5 beim X oder 4,55 GhZ beim XT die Testergebnisse sind nahezu ident, egal ob CB 15, CB 20, Prime 95, die 50 MHZ bringen KEINEN nennenswerten Zuwachs an Leistung.Mein Fazit: Wie schon beim Erscheinen der XT CPU`s habe ich vermutet, dass es sich um besonders gut selektierte CPU`s der letzten Fertigungs Generation der 3000er Serie handelt und genau so kann man es auch stehen lassen. Die XT`s sind sehr gut Taktende X Cpu`s wer Pech hat bekommt eben nicht zufällig eine Spitzen CPU wie ich, bei den XT Modellen kann man sich aber die maximal mögliche Leistung zu recht erhoffen und erwarten aber mehr als 15 - 30 € würde ich für 3% Mehrleitung nicht ausgeben, der 3800 mit X oder mit XT ist trotzdem mein Favorit bei der 3000er Serie.Update: mit etwas Zeit und Testen mit verschiedenen Spannung - Settings habe ich nun stabile 4,6 Ghz all Core, 3600 Mhz Ram mit 14 er Latenzen, CB 15, CB 20 stabil, Prime 95 instabil .Das entspricht fast genau einem + von 40 % gegenüber einem 2700x bei 20% weniger Stromverbrauch - wenn mich jemand nach der derzeit besten Allround CPU fragt: 3800 XT wenn der Preis bei dem des X liegt.', ""Upgraded from a 2700X and machine is performing better.This CPU does perform extremely well for many applications I've tried such as gaming and CAD although is not a worthwhile significant upgrade from my old 2700X. Having been in a situation where I needed a new CPU the 3800XT was chosen as it offered, at least on paper, a marked clock speed improvement on the 2700X and the CPU was on sale. I must say the CPU is hitting 4.7GHz single core boost straight out of the box and 4.5GHz multi-core boost. Paired with an AIO cooler this performance is not marred with high temperatures either - on multi-core boost it merely touches 72C. This CPU is designed for higher end machines and therefor requires an excellent cooling solution.Overclocking? In my opinion you will yeald a performance boost in only particular specific applications. For gaming just set XMP on in BIOS and allow the single-core to boost to 4.7GHz. Manual overclocking disables the single core boost and therefor you will likely not get extra performance in gaming. Of course with next gen consoles utilising the same basic architecture as the CPU (8C/16T), in the future an overclocked multi-core setup may be beneficial."", ""My build benchmarked in the 92nd percentile of current PC's in the world, with the stock AMD CPU cooler, (no liquid)!My Current PC build:• AMD Ryzen 7 3800XT 8-core/16-Threads.• AMD Wraith Prism CPU Cooler with Copper Base & 4 Heat Pipes.• EVGA GeForce RTX-3060.• ASUS ROG Strix B450 ATX Motherboard.• 32GB (4x8GB) DDR4 3200MHz Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO Desktop Memory.• 1TB Western Digital Blue M.2/NVMe Internal SSD, Gen3 PCIe up to 2,400 MB/s.• Seasonic FOCUS GX-650, 650W 80+Gold Full-Modular PSU.• 3x SilverStone AB120R 120mm PWM Addressable RGB Case Fans.• EVGA PowerLink; PCI-e 12volt power adapter, part # 600-PL-2816-LR (EVERYONE should be using this on their GPU).• Windows 10 Pro• Adobe Creative Suite Master Collection 5• Asphalt Legends 9Only the very wealthy (or foolish), feel a need to buy a 3080/3090 GPU, AMD 5950x, an intel i9-11900k.

Will update if anything changes, but like I said, the chip seems to be as advertised"", 'Coming from a 2700x the performance difference is pretty noticeable, especially in single threaded tasks.  However, unlike the 2700x, this is of a chiplet design.  There is only 1 8 core chiplet on this CPU that is designed to run very fast and since it is manufactured at 7nm is EXTREMELY heat dense and runs hot.  I have this in a well ventilated case and have tried custom water cooling with the corsair cpu water block, a Noctua NH-U14S, and now a dual fan NHD15S.  Temps have honestly all been about the same.  After a few weeks I gave up trying to fight the CPU, now I just run it with PBO disabled in BIOS and set a fairly long fan curve for the CPU fans and just let it run as is with only XMP enabled.  Either the 3900X or 3700x run cooler for different reasons.  Overall, very satisfied with the purchase though.  Very fast CPU for gaming and streaming.  Very happy with the purchase and yes I was holding out for a 5900X but with garbage stock levels and pricing on most computer components right now I wanted to upgrade so here it is. :)', ""Upgraded from a Ryzen 2600. CPU roughly 30-40% better for about $150 more.  If you can get it on sale, it's worth the money. Otherwise, go with 5000 series Ryzen or a 3700X if available (usually $100 cheaper and near identical performance).Happy with the chip overall - it was available at a lower price point compared to anything else that was worth investing in at the time. Works well in both gaming and hobbyist graphic design/music/video production. Pair with fast RAM for best results. Use an aftermarket cooler because it gets toasty if you overclock it.  You don't need anything special to run it at stock. I use a Scythe Mugen 5 Rev.B and it averages about 50-60 degrees under load. There are plenty of similar coolers (4-6 heat pipes) around $40-50 CAD that will work just as well.""]"

Solo occasionalmente, con l'attivazione del Turbo Boost si va ben oltre, arrivando anche a 4 GHZ, con conseguente aumento temporaneo della potenza. Dopo breve tempo, però, il processore riprende ad operare entro i limiti di potenza di 65 W nominali. Questo non per problemi termici, ma unicamente per ragioni commerciali, ossia per diversificare il 10400 dai modelli superiori e renderlo a basso consumo.Molte motherboard di varie marche e, che io sappia, tutte le Asrock con chipset Intel 4XX e 5XX dispongono della possibilità di baypassare nel BIOS il limite di potenza, portandolo oltre.Ogni produttore ha la propria soluzione, con differente denominazione commerciale (Asus la chiama APE), ma personalmente preferisco la BFB di Asrock per due motivi:- la potenza attribuibile alla CPU è sino a 125 Watt e quindi non supera mai le specifiche massime Intel, così preservando il processore da eccessi;- l'impostazione è attivata di default su Auto, che comunque sembra sfruttare tutta la potenza disponibile.Con motherboard di altre aziende va tenuto conto che non tutte prevedono questa opzione e che di dafult è disattivata.Ad ogni modo, l'attivazione dell'opzione BFB (o con altro nome nel caso di altri produttori) l'i5 10400 non è più limitato dal TDP di 65 W, ma può sprigionare tutta la sua potenza con TDP a 125 W.HWInfo mostra come tutti i 6 core lavorino contemporaneamente a ben 4,3 GHz di frequenza base costante, con conseguente notevole incremento della potenza di calcolo. In sostanza tutti i core possono funzionare in frequenza massima contemporaneamente e senza limiti.Le prestazioni divengono, quindi, non molto distanti da quelle di un i5 10600K che lavori a frequenza standard (ossia senza overclock); manca solo un ulteriore Turbo Boost per arrivare esattamente pari, ma l'incremento prestazionale dell'i5 10400 è impressionante.Il rovescio della medaglia di tale incremento di frequenza e potenza è l'aumento del consumo, ovviamente. Per quanto riguarda il calore prodotto, il dissipatore stock è in grado di smaltirlo senza problemi.E' da tenere conto che questa opzione non danneggia la CPU perché la stessa continua ad operare entro le specifiche della serie i5, comportandosi in maniera simile, come detto, ad un i5 10600K senza overclock che operi sempre intorno alla frequenza base.E' peraltro sempre possibile variare il BFB, settandolo a piacere su altri valori, che spaziano da 70 a 125 Watt a passi di 5 W, così da raggiungere un compromesso tra prestazioni e consumi, ove necessario.Considerando il prezzo del processore, poter disporre di fatto di un modello che è qusi pari al modello di punta della serie i5 non è poco.Posso dire che nei fatti il 10400 con BFB attivo surclassa l'i7 6700 K che ho nel computer principale, con un divario che diviene consistente soprattutto nelle applicazioni che fanno largo uso del multicore e del multitread.Riguardo alla grafica, l'Intel UHD630 non è certo paragonabile ad una scheda grafica dedicata.Ma per l'uso ufficio ed in generale per impieghi non molto impegnativi va anche meglio del previsto, con una gestione fluida della applicazioni e buone prestazioni di decodifica video.Per 161 Euro ritengo sia stato un'ottimo acquisto. Sto valutando, infatti, di sostituire l'7 6700K con un i9 10900, che grazie alla tecnologia BFB riesce a confrontarsi con un i9 10900K o 10850K, pur costando sensibilmente meno."", 'Como não é modelo F vem com gráficos integrados, da pra jogar praticamente todos os jogos com gráficos no Low, mas se quiser gráficos bonitos é recomendado uma placa de video dedicada, produto muito bom e ótimo custo beneficio.', 'We bought it to build a PC and it seems to be working great', 'Utilisé en bureautique avec la partie graphique intégrée le proc rempli parfaitement son travail.', 'Entrega a tiempo y en buen estado', 'Fácil instalação, já vem com cooler e pasta térmica.

There seems to be a bit of a price premium on the Intel processors though.Update April 2023 - I have been using this processor for 7-8 months now and I would whole-heartedly recommend it.  For programming it has been excellent.  I consistently use a virtual machine via Docker and this CPU handles it with aplomb.  Also, it has been great for gaming.

Original purchase was June of 2020.While this device is still technically holding my computer, it's definitely not holding it like it should.  The stick-on rubber pads that are designed to grip the case fell off sometime around December 2020.  Once those fell off, the computer slid all around with minor desk movement, and wasn't stable.  It fell backwards in the bracket the way its pictured in my photos, but the top of the computer got stuck on the top part of the bracket and my desk.  So basically its leaning backwards on about a 10 degree incline, and only doesn't fall out because its hitting the bracket and the desk.More permanent (screw or bolt in)  non slip pads should be given with this unit.  Or perhaps just put real adhesive on the pads that are used.  Something thick like those 3 M Gel pads or something.Original review below-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So, don't be like me, and make assumptions about this bracket.I assumed my computer weighed less than 22lbs.  In fact, it weighed 23lbs, so I ended up taking a hard drive out to be sure it was under the weight limit.I also assumed that there was PLENTY of room under my desk to mount my computer in a pleasing way.  This was incorrect for 2 reasons.1.) My computer tower was much too large to mount from the top mount with the intention of spinning it without being incredibly in the way (to give it enough room to spin)2.) I didn't take into account that I'd want one particular side facing outwards.  I could have mounted it on a different spot on my desk that would have been more out of the way, but in order to keep the accessible side facing towards me (since i couldn't spin it) the wires would have been facing towards the center of the room.  That would have made it look worse because part of the reason I wanted this mount in the first place was to increase the organized appearance in my computer room.The lesson here being, make sure you give careful though to where you'll want the computer under the desk, which side you'll want facing towards you, and whether or not there will be room to make it spin if that is your intention (get out a measuring tape and check!!)That being said- now that I have it mounted, its mostly out of the way, and looks much better than it used too.Next thing is the bracket itself.  The slider that adjusts the height of the bracket I have an issue with.  In order to adjust it, it has two ways to secure it down on ONE SIDE of the railing.  THe middle of the rail has a screw that holds it on and allows it to slide up and down, but it doesn't actually support the bottom.  So once you have it to the height you need, you secure it down on the one side with a hand screw and a hex screw.  That means all of the weight of your computer is resting on one side of the railing.  I fail to see why they couldn't have just put another hex screw or hand screw on the opposite site to share the weight on both sides of the bracket.The next issue I have with the bracket is that depending on your computer tower height, you may not get it to fit snugly against the top and bottom.  I included a picture of the top of mine, and you can see there is a gap between the computer and the bracket.  I could have opted not to use the supplied rubber pads and it would have JUST fit on the next notch/hole up, but then it would have slid around all over the place. (I tried it and realized it was less secure that way).  I thought there would be a way to more fine-tune the height adjustment the same way there is to fine-tune the width adjustment.  Another incorrect assumption on my part.All of that being said, however, the computer is still pretty solid in the bracket and doesn't move around despite not being gripped tightly on all sides.  I don't think its going to fall out of the bracket.  I'm worried since I'm right at the max capacity for the bracket that it may not have longevity but I guess I will find out (final weight after removing my drive was 21.8lbs)  For the price paid, I guess its a pretty decent bracket, thus why 4 stars and not 3.  If it fails anytime soon, I will update my review."", 'Me ayudo a tener más espacio en mi escritorio de trabajo. Exclente producto. Lo recomiendo', 'could be a bit more sturdy. followed mounting instructions but after several months the mount failed and my pc fell to the floor', 'Solid build made out of metal that can expand in size for taller towels and can also expand for wider towers, 8"" max.It can also swivel 360 if mount correctly.Dislikes: My tower is 8"" wide and it barelly clear it and the top part that kind of hold it in place when fully extent will end up in a weird angle. What I did, I took that part apart and used a solid edge like a door or a table and i bended it to hug my tower better, now it sits a lot better.Wish the base part where it sits was a bit bigger or should at least be able to expand as well that way it sits better, this will prevent the tower from falling backwards if it gets push. Last, insted of the round tiny cushing dots that will fall off when you try to push/slide to tower in place. Instead why not just cover the entire area that comes in contact with the tower have some type of soft rubber/foam feel to it.Other than those flows its perfect!!!⁰', 'I was looking for something to mount my eGPU under my desk, to get it out of the way. THE eGPU is a lot shorter in height than most mounts will work with as they have a solid metal vertical support that can only go so small. The strapping on this type of mount is more flexible.The metal bracket at the top is surprisingly heavy and sturdy. Good enough sliding motion with nylon sliders in a lubed channel. The width was easily adjustable as well and the handle works well for grabbing it to pull out for powering my eGPU on and off. The front back travel and swivel is enough with a deep desk to both hide it and get access when needed.I only gave it 4 stars as I found the buckles to be awkward in comparison to the rest of the setup. A bit difficult to get a tight pull on them. They did lock down fine it was just the initial tension that was hard to set. Not a deal breaker and I would use this again but also not up to the quality of the rest of the mount.', 'Make sure you put velcro tabs at the bottom of your unit or it will slide right TF out.', 'Good product.

I swapped it into my main PC, moving my older 2950 (16 core, 32 threads) CPU to my media server/NAS.In my experience with the 2970, from a practical standpoint, I haven't found it to be any improvement at all over the 2950, EXCEPT in very specific use cases. The 2970 has the same clock speed at the 2950 and MOST applications, to this day, just don't know what to do with 48 threads/24 cores, and the CPU remains underutilized in most applications. Transcoding, gaming, and standard office word won't noticeably increase on the 2970 over the 2950. (The 2970 WILL allow you to run 2-3 instances of CPU-intensive encoding/transcoding at the same time though, pinging the CPU all the way to 100% (which is the only way to actually get it to 100% in my experience))HOWEVER, if you, like me, run VMS, then this CPU will start to make more sense. The massive bandwidth available to the 2970 will allow you to run a full VM of a resource-intensive OS (Windows 7+, Linux servers, databases, etc.) side-by-side with your main PC's OS, without even blinking. That was the primary use-case I got the 2970 for, and it works flawlessly.If all you want your threadripper for is faster gaming, encoding, decoding, transcoding, etc, stick with the 2950. You will get essentially the same experience for FAR less cost. Or, save up and go with the Gen3 Threadrippers on the new sTRX4 sockets from AMD (which is the reason I stuck with Gen2 for now, as I DO NOT want to upgrade my MoBo in the current post-COVID parts and supply drought).So, 5 stars from me, with the above caveats ;)"", ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0I bought this when it was on sale for $900 (that still hurts thinking it was 'on sale' at that price). I was skeptic, but man, was it money well spent. This machine is a beast. I run a software company from my home, write programs, use AutoCAD and enjoy video games. This processor handles everything. Many times I need multiple computers to test different operating systems for my products. This processor can handle everything I have thrown at it, without even one single time of slow down in a year! One time, I was running five different operating systems IN THE BACKGROUND for a week, and didnt notice. I also believe, in that year time, I have only turned off my computer about 24 hours total. The only time it is shut down is for required updates, which takes one restart, and then it is back up.The only downside I had with this processor was there was no clear instructions on how to install it. There are two sleeves on this processor, and I thought there was only one. It took me a while of saying, 'Why doesnt this fit?' before I realized I had to REMOVE the outer sleeve and KEEP the inner sleeve. Made no since. But, it worked out in the end.I cannot express how happy this processor has made me. This processor is well worth the money."", ""I've ordered it again and again. Every time my son builds a computer, it gets an AMD Ryzen processor. They're stable, they won't let you down during a game. These things don't even need a review. They're good and every gamer already knows it. And now the folk who buy for gamers know it, too. Good luck!"", ""As another viewer stated that this is a great upgrade from the the first generation Threadripper.  I had the 1950.  The first one I got did not boot beyond the PCI initialization.  Don't know why.  Thanks to Amazon's great return/exchange policy, I was able to get another one.  This one booted right up!  It is definitely faster than what I had before, and now I can upgrade to Windows 11 as well."", 'Pro: Great for every single thingCon: Slow ram and not so fast cores too..I say this with so very much love for it. But I noticed that my ryzen 7 has performed better at a lower clock speed and less ram.. this being said... I still love my threadripper as just a casual Unraid server', 'Purchased this 2970X to upgrade my home server from a 1920X. This was a drop in upgrade on a Aorus Extreme X399 with 64GB of Gskill Flare X.  This system serves as my home theater library as well as hosting multiple game servers. I’ve had absolutely zero issues with stability or thermals.  I will also note I am cooling this in a 4U server chassis using a Noctua NH-U9 threadripper cooler!', 'I should have known that the sale price is too good to be true. I ordered the threadripper 2970WX and ended up receiving a set of cheap keytags with a sticker that has all of the 2970WX infomation printed on it. How could amazon let this happened? I am returning the ""very expensive keytags"" now. Buyer beware of this scam.', ""Just got my build finished, but have only been able to perform some basic tests and benchmarks, including some computational intensive applications (DAZ and BOINC).This CPU is so fast and powerful that even when DAZ is presented with > 4000 CUDA cores (RTX 2080 Ti), and given the choice, it will use the CPU exclusively.  (Manual bench-marking in DAZ shows CPU-only and GPU-Only to be virtually identical, and using combined CPU+GPU is only marginally faster (~3%)).As for BOINC, it will take several days for the numbers to average out, but initial results are showing that this 24-core Threadripper at 25% (using 50% of the CPUs, 50% of the time) is WAY out-performing my i7 3770K at ~56% (75%, 75%), which isn't that much of a surprise since it has more than 5x the total processing power."", ""I've been putting together computer systems for 30 years.  The Tr4 socket has to be the absolute simplest install I have ever experienced.  Hands down  the most professional socket out there in the consumer realm - adding water or an air cooler is a breeze, no compressing, no stress, just slip on and fold down - a dream to install.  Insofar as the CPU goes , well, I am studying for my VCP *(VMware certified professional) and with 24 cores I can easily fit an entire virtualized datacenter on the system, running under VMware workstation - all at once.  24 cores, 48 threads is simply insane in the consumer space - this processor is well worth the money.""]"

(A condition d’être sûr que le cpu soit bien placé)Tous c’est bien déroulé dans mon cas, attention à bien positionner le cpu avant serrage et ça devrait bien ce passer.Après délid et changement pour du métal liquide Thermal Grizzly conductonaut les températures sont bien plus base et mon cpu est maintenant grand maximum à 70 degrés en stress test et environ 55/60 degrés en jeux. ( ventirad dark rock pro 3).Si besoin n’hésitez pas à prendre ce kit qui peut vous faire grandement baisser la température du cpu.PS : j’ai aussi ajoutés 3 ventilateurs en vers le haut de mon boîtiers ce qui peut aussi aider à avoir une baisse de température aussi importante …', 'Delid d\'un ancien processeur (I7-3770K). Fonctionne nickel. Par contre, je vois des personnes qui disent que ce dernier n\'ai pas compatible, au contraire il est parfaitement compatible ! Mais passe au millimètre près. Ce qui est logique pour qu\'il tienne parfaitement sans dommages lors du serrage ! Donc il faut bien le mettre correctement, est appuyé légèrement sur les cotés. Voilà tout.Tout est fournis avec. Du delid jusqu\'au recollage de ce dernier.Une fois les visses du boitier principale serrer au maximum (sans forcer comme une brute hein lol), vissé la grosse visse, à l\'aide de la clé fournie. Cette dernière va tourner facilement au début, mais va bloqué à un moment (normal car elle arrive contre l\'IHS... la partie supérieure du processeur). Il faudra alors exercer une pression assez forte sur la clé. Et dès que vous entendez un bruit ""clac"", et que la clé devient facile à tourner, vous pouvez stopper !  C\'est que ce dernier est bien delid (décapsuler).Il faudra alors faire très attention de ne pas abîmer le DIE (la partie central métallique voir photo).Il faudra tout nettoyer, le plus simple à l\'aide de lingette nettoyante de chez Noctua qui sont vraiment nickel. Pour enlever la colle d\'origine, le plus simple est une lame de rasoir ou cutters (sans manche lame nue) la mettre avec un angles pour ne pas rayer, et la passé sous la colle à fin de tout enlever !Une fois le processeur nickel, vous pouvez remettre de la pâte thermique, ou du métal liquide (celle de chez Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut est la meilleure du marché) mais attention pour le métal liquide, renseignez vous sur le web et vidéo YouTube.Une fois la pâte thermique posé correctement (il faut en mettre des deux côté correctement étalé n\'y trop n\'y pas assez coté DIE et IHS juste au niveau du DIE... Le mieux est de poser 4 morceaux de scotch basique, des 4 côtés du DIE en laissant que ce dernier apparent, comme ça même si vous déborder (et vous pouvez déborder avec le scotch..)  vous ne risque rien ! Et une fois le scotch retiré délicatement, il ne restera que la pâte sur le DIE (partie métallique du milieux).Une fois étalé des deux côtés correctement, reposer l\'IHS sur le DIE comme à l\'origine dans le bon sens (repérez vous à la colle d\'origine qui laisse une légère trace sombre malgré le nettoyage.. logiquement y a une toute petite partie sans colle qui laisse deviner le sens de l\'IHS, elle sert également pour laissé sortir l\'air coincé). Où prenez des photos.Une fois reposé, le plus simple, est de mettre de la cyanolite (colle forte résistante jusqu\'à 100°). Simplement sur les 4 coins du processeur suffis amplement sans débordement ! Évitez de faire couler sur le boitier de delid... Ça va de soit, mais peut arriver.Vous pouvez utiliser de la SADER colle spéciale experts - vibrations et haute température (-60° à +200°), la même sorte que l\'original, mais le procédé est plus compliqué, car il faudra la mettre au même endroits que l\'original en laissant l\'ouverture pour les bulles d\'air !Le plus simple, si votre processeur ne dépassera pas 100° (ceux qui me paraît logique après un delid). C\'est la cyanolite comme expliqué au-dessus. Vous pouvez regarder des vidéos sur YouTube ou cette dernière est utilisé. Une minuscule goutte sur chaque coins (contrairement à la colle joint) et c\'est good. La cyanolite résiste à l\'eau, l\'humidité, au vibrations, à la chaleur jusqu\'à 100° et au pressions forte (coup). Aucun risque parfait pour les processeurs. J\'utilise la cyanolite depuis toujours. Et j\'en ai des centaines à mon actif des delid. Jamais eu un seul problème !Y en a même qui ne recolle pas leurs processeur, vu la pression exercée par le socket, aucun risque et le contact ce fera. Mais pour éviter tout problèmes et notamment de le faire tomber, vaut mieux recoller.Une fois séché (cyanolite en 30 minutes c\'est ok) et la colle joint faut 24h00 minimum de séchage.N\'oubliez pas, une fois la colle appliquée, il faut vite mettre la parties collage du boitier, et serrer un minimum (au moment ou la visses commence à décoller sa propre partie (blanche), il faut stoppé de façon à garder le système droit.. que la visse central qui exerce une pression sur le processeur ne parte pas sur les cotés).Séchage fini, vous regardez que rien n\'a débordé, sinon vous pouvez nettoyer ce qui déborde (si vous avez fait attention logiquement pas de problème).Puis une fois impeccablement nettoyé, ce dernier peut rejoindre son socket ! (Dernier coup de nettoyage une fois maintenue dans le socket de la carte mère, pour enlever toute trace de doigts et poussières).Utilisé également du métal liquide cité au-dessus entre le processeur et le ventirad / watercooling.. si vous avez utilisé du métal liquide sur le DIE et pour le ventirad, vous gagnerez facilement 20° !ATTENTION : Le métal liquide est interdit sur des ventirad en aluminium ! Car le composant va bouffé l\'aluminium ! Malgré que sur les derniers ventirad et watercooling, c\'est du cuivre etc et n\'ont plus de l\'aluminium d\'utiliser, mais pour ceux possédant d\'anciens ventirad, faite attention. Et dans ce cas prenez de la NT-H2 de Noctua (l\'une des plus performante du marché actuellement). Le métal liquide utilisé lors du delid sur le DIE ne gène en rien les ventirad en aluminium. Comme aucun contact aura lieu de ce côté là.Le mieux est de porter des gants de protection du début à la fin, ça évite les traces de doigts, la transpiration et donc l\'humidité, et la poussière.J\'espère avoir résumé au maximum, faite le moi savoir si j\'ai pu vous aider ! Et bon courage dans vos futurs delid ! Si vous avez la moindre question, n\'hésitez pas je reçois les notifications.

Muy buena CPU si tienes un presupuesto ajustado.Tras 8 meses de uso intensivo no podría estar más satisfecho, he esperado un tiempo prudencial para hacer la reseña. Todas las semanas montamos equipos de Gaming, hasta hace unos meses sólo montábamos procesadores INTEL®, pero con la nueva generación de Procesadores Ryzen®, Amd está ganando de nuevo  terreno en el mundo de las CPU. Este es un procesador de gama media con unos resultados más que excelentes.MUY IMPORTANTE: Si te haces con este procesador asegúrate que la placa base que compres sea compatible con la 2ª generación de procesadores RYZEN (las que vienen con el chip X470 ya vienen preparadas, y no tendrás que andar actualizando la bios), aunque en cuanto puedas yo actualizaría la bios de la placa para evitar problemas futuros.Como comento en el título es una opción excelente si no quieres que tu equipo se salga de presupuesto. Tiene un consumo de 65W, y una velocidad base de la CPU es de 3,4 Ghz, llegando hasta los 3,9 Ghz, si quieres hacer un overclocking extremo este no es el procesador adecuado, prueba mejor con un Ryzen 2700X.Cuando monté el equipo quería probar unos componentes nuevos para tener conocimiento en persona de su funcionamiento y poder asesorar a mis clientes en futuras compras. Con el Setup que tengo ahora mismo montado me mueve a 60 FPS en resolución FULLHD (1920x1080) “todos los juegos del mercado” (Fortnite, SW Battleground, SEKIRO, GTA…).Compré este procesador porque cuando monté el equipo no quería pasarme mucho de presupuesto (cosa que finalmente se desmadró), pero 150€ por este procesador era y es un chollo. En un futuro montaré un Ryzen superior ya que adquirí un monstruo de placa para hacer un Overclocking a lo bestia, aquí os dejo la review de la placa base. (en mi opinión mucha placa para este procesador, pero desde siempre la P.B. es el componente al que dedico mayor parte del presupuesto a la hora de montar un equipo, y no he petado una placa en 15 años, procesadores he quemado unos cuantos ;) ):Enlace a placas base compatibles con CPU’s Ryzen de segunda generación:✔️Gama media:\xa0\nMSI X470 Gaming Plus\n✔️Gama media/alta:\xa0\nAsus ROG STRIX X470-F\nCONFIGURACIÓN EQUIPO GAMING GAMA MEDIA:• P.B: MSI X470 Gaming M7/AC• CPU:  RYZEN 2600 3,4Ghz hasta los 3,9 Ghz.

It comes without saying that I was no longer being shackled down by the limitation of my old PC with my work flow and also the games I play multitasking with no issues. It's teamed up with an MSI Radeon RX 560 AERO ITX 4G OC128-bit 4GB graphic card.There's tons of tests on how well this CPU performs with games especially mainstream games that I do not need to go into as I'm more into video stuff so watching YouTube videos in 1080p is something else coming from 480p tho without realizing it I still find myself watching in 480p at times. Old habits. Watching 1080p HEVC videos with no lag is again something else to behold, heck, Ryzen 5 2600 isn't on his final form yet with that stuff. [Edit Oct 2020] Viewing 4K YouTube videos is also no issues either. Exceptions of course is based on your internet speed's capacity to buffer fast. Not sure about watching in 4K HEVC video tho since my monitor is only 1080p.[Edit Oct 25, 2020] Video encoding can take 30 min to 10 hours depending on the length, resolution, and which chroma sampling profile is being used, any filters will add to the encoding time. A 24 min clip with veryslow or placebo settings (with filters) are no problem speed-wise with H.264 10 bit encodes. From either 4:2:0 or 4:4:4 chroma sampling profile finishes it up quick with 18 thread encoding speed! This coming from almost an entire day's worth on my old PC's pitiful 3 threads using the same settings. Regular H.264 8 bit will use 15 threads as its max (if --thread=0 is used) and will obviously be much faster then its 10 bit counterpart. I recommend trying out tesa + subme 11 mode with either profiles if time isn't an issue.Not tested it with HEVC as of yet.[Edit - Oct 25, 2020] A few sample tests using HEVC 4:4:4 720p with veryslow and sea mode settings (no tune) of a 24 min clip took about 2-13 hours depending on the amount of filters being applied (such as heavy-duty filters like Anti-Aliasing) with max 12 numa-pools (it's kinda like --thread in H.264 but not really?) if left at its default.  The profile 8 bit, 10 bit, or 12 bit will either shorten or increase the time, However, the trade of will be higher quality such as more smoother gradients decreasing banding, color format (both at the cost of increased computation during playback) and of course the chroma sampling being used. Be mindful if your target is compatibility tho consult with the x265 documentation if interested especially with the release of HEVC 3.0 (GCC 8.3.0) which brings a number of changes such as the addition of the tune animation.To be noted all of this was done on a single Crucial 8GB DDR4 RAM which rarely hit 100% RAM output doing all of the above while encoding but I may add an additional 8/16 GB RAM in the future especially for any 1080p (and 4K) HEVC encodes, so you may want to increase your RAM if that's your target. Further note, if you watch streaming videos such as YouTube while waiting for your video to finish up be certain not to open so many browser tab. The RAM will increase closer to 100% if you've got just 8 GB, speaking from experience.I purchased this through the OutletPC seller and they were able to help me out on my concerns and questions as a first time CPU buyer though it wasn't the best of help it got the point across regarding the handling of the CPU and the chances of being a root cause when troubleshooting hardware issues getting the PC to boot properly."", ""If you're looking for a processor that can handle all your multitasking and gaming needs with ease, then the AMD Ryzen 5 2600 Processor with Wraith Stealth Cooler is the perfect choice for you. This processor packs a punch and is a true workhorse that can handle any task you throw at it.One of the best things about this processor is that it comes with the Wraith Stealth Cooler, which is not only quiet but also keeps the processor running cool, so you don't have to worry about overheating and thermal throttling.The Ryzen 5 2600 is a bit older model and its clock speed might not be as high as some of the newer models, but that doesn't mean it's not a future-proof processor. It's still a great option for anyone looking for a powerful and efficient processor that won't break the bank.Overall, I highly recommend the AMD Ryzen 5 2600 Processor with Wraith Stealth Cooler to anyone looking to build a PC that can handle anything you throw at it.

I am happy I went with this processor instead of the i3-8100 ( which I was thinking of at first ) but my friend suggested an i5 of the 8th gen at least for basic future proofing .( BTW ) my YT channel is : Zealous Pumpkin check me out !

Amazon is a joke. The price go up and down by 300%. I had to use the 3rd party site to monitor the prices and buy it when it was reasonably cheap. A rich company who has put millions of business out of business is play game with people's hard earned income. God knows why one person needs so much money. sickness I guess.The first thing I noticed was the box. Suppose to protect this tiny chip which is the most expensive and important part of the computer. Yet it was placed at the top of the box with a plastic cover but the cheap 50p cooler was well protected under it. It is probably designed by god, like he placed the testicle outside the box in a vulnerable position. Really stupid idea.After a lot of research I chose to get a i5-8400 because it has enough cores (6) and has a 2.8 GHz base clock speed. Do not be fooled by the low Hz as it is deliberately set low to make 8600K good. If the processor does not need the speed it is better to stay low because the CPU consumes the most energy. In fact I do not put the heater on during winter and just use my PC to keep the room warm. I used the laptop only for couple of day and my room was freezing.  The Hz can go up to 3.9 on a single core (if you have a good cooling) which is near 8600K at 4.3Hz.I do not play games but I am a software engineer and write programmes so I need a good CPU. This is to replace my Intel Core Due which is 1.8Hz maxes to 2.8Hz.  Since you cannot OC this you do not need to go for high end motherboard such as 300 series. I got a 370 MB because it has connections and other feathers I liked.It came with a fan you can find a kinder egg so I invested in a good cooling system."", 'Ho assemblato un PC con questo prodotto e fin che lo usato andava egregiamente', 'Processore con buone caratteristiche di velocità per un utilizzo moderato dei videogiochi', ""I went from a first generation Intel Core i7-920 to this eight generation Intel Core i5-8600 and the difference is like night and day. I use my PC for software development, not gaming, but am very pleased with how fast it runs. I used to have constant slowdowns and pauses, though I'm not sure if that was caused by the HDD or the CPU or a combo of the two, but now that I'm using this new CPU along with a 1TB SSD there is no slowdown anywhere, on any program. I have a three monitor setup without a dedicated video card so I'm sure the CPU is having to handle much of the GPU work, and for software I use various versions Visual Studio along with image editing software (and to a lesser extent video editing software), font editing software, and many other miscellaneous other development tools.At idle the CPU seems to hover around 36-40 degrees Celcius and when working it can get into the high 50s, low 60s. Because I bought the 8600 version and not the 8600K version which is meant for overclocking, mine came with a stock CPU heatsink and fan with pre-applied thermal paste. The heatsink is fairly small and the fan points straight up which blows the air away from the CPU and toward the case's side panel. I used this briefly but quickly got annoyed by the sound of the fan spinning up faster whenever the temperature got into the 40s so I purchased a larger 3rd party heatsink that has heatpipes and a fan that's aimed toward the back of the PC case where the ventilation holes are. I also bought a graphite thermal pad so I wouldn't have to deal with thermal paste. This combo didn't seem to reduce the CPU temperature at all but it did make the fan much quieter, and that was the whole point.Whatever you are using your PC for I don't think you'll be disappointed with the CPU but if the noise of a fan constantly increasing and decreasing speed would bother you then you'll certainly want to purchase a better CPU cooler.If you found my review helpful please let me know by hitting that button below otherwise please leave me a comment letting me know what I can do to improve.

Tenía anteriormente:-CPU: Intel Core i5 4440 3.1GHz-GPU: Asus Strix RX 470 OC 4GB-Placa: Gigabyte B85M-D3H-RAM: 16GB DDR3 1866MHz-Fuente: Aerocool KCAS Bronze 600WLo único que quería cambiar fue la CPU, la placa y la RAM. Ya que como mi anterior PC tenía Intel de 4ª generación, CPU de DDR3, y placa con socket de 1150. Para saltar a la nueva generación, tenía que cambiar la CPU, que además, había que cambiar la placa, y había que cambiar la RAM. Opté por el Intel Core i5 8400 de 2.8GHz, la RAM era Ballistix Sport LT de 16GB DDR4 de 2400MHz (8x2) y la placa era Gigabyte B360M-DS3H.Con todo esto, manteniendo la gráfica y la fuente de alimentación, obtuve unos mejores resultados tanto en embalaje de productos, como de calidad de estos mismos. Del i5 4440 al i5 8400 ha sido como un 30% o más de mejora, así como la mejora de la RAM al pasar de 1866MHz y DDR3 a los 2400MHz y DDR4.La CPU si bien a mí se me calentaba unas pocas veces debido a las múltiples tareas que hice los primeros días (instalar programas, juegos, etc), el rendimiento es indiscutible que es de calidad-precio. Por menos de 200 € tienes una buena CPU. Con respecto a los juegos, probando The Witcher III: Wild Hunt en Alto-Ultra mantuve alrededor de los 60 y los 75fps (activé la V-Sync porque el tearing del juego me molestaba, y mi monitor era de máximo 75Hz), y los resultados eran sobresalientes, sino que más destacables. Si queréis montaros un buen PC para jugar, el i5 8400 es una buena inversión para lo que vale, podéis jugar a prácticamente todo con este procesador. Se aprovechan muy bien los 6 núcleos y 6 hilos que tiene, con frecuencia de base de 2.8GHz y turbo de hasta 4.0GHz.', 'si', ""For a long time I had reservations about upgrading from my i5-4690k since most games wouldn't take advantage of the i7-4790k's hyperthreading, and upgrading to 6th or 7th gen i5's would include the cost of a new motherboard and DDR4 ram for barely any performance difference. This was a sentiment of many Haswell-quad core owners. However, things change when it comes to the 8th-gen i5's. These things have 6 threads and 6 cores. So the i5-8600k I purchased is technically more practical than any previous i7 since the hyperthreading doesn't compare to having a real core.Even then my only expectation was that it would prevent any CPU bottleneck for when I upgrade my graphics card beyond the GTX 1070 I owned now. I ran some benchmarks of the Batman Arkham games and the average fps for each at 1440p at max detail ( minus the interactive fog and debris for Arkham Knight) and this CPU raised the minimum framerates across the board. It turned out I was already bottlenecked and the 8600k alleviated it.I should clarify that I was already able to achieve 70+ fps in these games before, but the streaming issues with the UE3 engine would cause many drops below 60 and occasionally in the 40's when gliding in the games at max detail especially Arkham Knight), which was disparaging for a GTX 1070. Even overclocking didn't work, and now I know it was due to the 4690k. Before, Arkham Knight used to dip into 50's and 40's when gliding over certain parts of the city and while driving. I just went over those areas again and those dips are gone ( I guess since the game was mostly optimized for the PS4, it preferred having more cores). I was actually struggling to find ways to lower the FPS outside of enabling more of the gameworks features. Certain stress points in the older games have also had less dips.Lesson learned, even though a lot of sources may say the previous Intel quad-cores may be enough to give you a good amount of frames, the extra cores from the eighth gen can certainly raise the minimums.""]"

Dieser 10 Kerne Prozessor mit 20 Threads passt gut zu unseren neuen Anforderungen. Die Adressierung von bis zu 128GB RAM, Hyper-Threading, Quad-Channel für DDR4 RAMs und 44 Lanes sind unabdingbare Anforderungen. Der Turbo-Boost wird nur temporär genutzt, passt jedoch sehr gut in unser Konzept. Damit auch die Leistung genutzt werden kann, wurden auch die Umgebungskomponenten neu dimensioniert. Besonders der zusätzliche M.2 Speicher war neben dem RAM wichtig. Gerne hätten wir den M.2 Optane-Memory-Speicher genutzt, aber mit den zurzeit verfügbaren nur 32 GB Modulen ist dieser definitiv zu klein. Die Wahl fiel hier auf die M.2 SSD, Samsung 960 PRO MZ-V6P1T0BW, Interner Solid State Drive mit 1TB. Diese erweist sich als sehr schnell und wird direkt auf dem Mainboard im M.2 Slot platziert. Damit der Quad-Channel für DDR4 RAMs genutzt werden kann, werden vier(!) Corsair CMK64GX4M4B3200C16 Vengeance LPX 4 x 16 GB Desktop Arbeitsspeicher Kit (DDR4, 3200 MHz) eingesetzt.

Temps were good pushing,  75c plus in these applications,  and a bit higher under prime95 Toucher Testing, but No throttling  Then pulled it, delidded it.  Using  liquid metal grizzly conductent,  then began the tediously slow over clocking process.(Corsair V2, 240 closed loop water cooler installed). After much tweeking in small increments and time, I acheved , 5.0 GHz, Windows Boot and stable,  not exeding 85c under intel extreem testing but, failed a 24 hour prime95 stability testing. (Could not boot into windows at 5.1 GHz) Backing off with offset of 3 and 4, I achieved 4.8GHz, all core sinked finally, and  passed a 48 hour prime95 cpu torcher test (delidded, water cooled closed loop)  temp not exeding 86c. In everyday 4k rendering, photo shop, Handbreak, etc temps do not exeed 72c to 74c at most. Riding high 60c mostly.  Then back down to 32c under no load. 4.8GHz, Stable all cores. This Exceeded my expectations for this CPU (or i won the silicon lotery). It runs cooler than my i7 7700k Kaybe Lake, Delidded, water cooled, with a stable over clock of 4.9GHz all cores, 3 and 4 ofset. For a Refrance... the Delided, water cooled i7 7700k 4 core Kaby Lake, Handbreaked a 30 gig move at variable bitrate,  HQ H.265 Encoading in 1 hour 56 minutes hitting high 80c\'s,  bumping into mid 90c\'s. The Delided, Water Cooled 4.8GHz over clocked 12 core i9 7920x bumped low 70c, highest 75c and did the same movie, with same encoding settings in 32 minutes. All i can say is,  ""Holy Cow""!! But for you gamers only, know this cpu is overkill and a Waust of your money. If you are a gamer only, Go with the 8700k 6 core Coffee Lake, delidded it, water cool it and clock it to a stable 5.0GHz on a good Asus, Gigabyte motherboard z370 chip set and have fun!!  But for refrance, CPU never goes above 58c on any game, but most of my games are more GPU intensive, hence the Asus 1080ti. Still, frame rate hitting the cpu is smooth and above 120 frame rate im most everthing, higher in some, (BUTTERY SMOOTH) game dependant. But go with Coffee Lake for gaming, 6 core 8700k. I am in love with this CPU in every way and it eats everything i though at its 12 cores, even doing back grown internet, youtube, etc while rendering 4k, handbreaking,  etc... all cotes are not even at 100 percent utilization... AMAZING!! .This CPU, in my opention is the best price point to dollar to core ratio,  but i leave you to your own opintion. Remember, intels base clock stock speed rating, no turbo or overclock is 2.9 on this CPU. I have it all cores, 4.8GHz, delidded, 240 corsair closed loop water cooled .. running stable and cool. If you can pass a 48 hour prime95 test , Your overclock (in my opention) is STABLE!! Enjoy what ever you choose. This was my choise. Iam a Verified  Amazon buyer at $1088.00', ""I'm coming from a 2009 2.66GHz 4-core Mac Pro. I'm no longer a fan of what Apple offers, especially in terms of price to performance and lack of user upgradable components. So after 20+ years with the Mac, I took a leap of faith and built my own PC.So far, a few weeks into using this new build, I absolutely LOVE this CPU. I primarily use this machine for photo editing with PhotoMechanic, Adobe Photoshop Cloud 2017, and Capture One Pro 11. This CPU can handle everything I throw at it without breaking a sweat. Even when I've run a 1000 image export in Capture One Pro, a 500 image batch process in Photoshop, I could go back into Capture One Pro, open a new job, render previews, and start RAW adjustments with absolutely no lag. It worked flawlessly. The RAW adjustment sliders are silky smooth, with no lag. Best of all, the CPU temps have remained an average of 55C under load at 4.4GHz overclocked. At 4.6GHz, the temps only averaged 70C - spiked to 76C a couple of times. I'm using the NZXT Kraken x52 CPU cooler. Works for me.For Photoshop, an application that prefers high clock frequencies vs. more cores, I love that this CPU has the same 4.5GHz Turbo Boost frequency as the Intel 7700K. That's incredibly impressive for an 8-core CPU. The 7700K, used to be the Photoshop king, but I would bet there is little to no real world difference between this 8 core 7820x and the 4-core 7700K when doing lightly threaded Photoshop tasks. The 7820x is so responsive.IMO, this CPU might be the best bang for the buck in terms of single, dual and multicore threaded applications. When you factor in the 28 PCIe lanes over the 16 PCIe lanes you get with the might i7 8700K, I still have to give the 7820x the nod. If you only need 16 PCIe lanes, then the 8700K will save you about $200 on the CPU, and maybe $50 on the Motherboard.With the 7820x you'll want a good Motherboard. Should go without saying, but that doesn't mean the most expensive.After tons of research about VRM issues with the Skylake-X CPUs, I bought the ASRock Extreme4. The two features I wanted most were, dual 8-pin CPU power connects, and the VRM heat pipe. Intel shotgunned this CPU family release, and IMO it caught the MOB manufacturers off guard, and many release their MOBs too quickly. EVGA wouldn't even release their MOBs, as they hadn't been thoroughly tested. These CPUs are power hungry, and if you OC without a good cooler, VRM cooling, and adequate power, they'll overheat and throttle.New and 2nd Gen x299 boards are already coming out with these dual 8-pin connects and VRM heat pipes (Taichai XE is one example of a Gen 2 x299 MOB). The Extreme4 is a new board released in November, a good few months after the release of Skylake-X. So they had time to get this board right, and it's one of the least expensive boards on the market.I had a limited budget of $2,000 - and if I could do it all over again, I would definitely buy this build again.7820x32GB G.Skill Trident Z RGB ram250GB SSD Boot drive8GB Sapphire Radeon RX 580NZXT Kraken x52 coolerASRock Extreme4 MotherboardEVGA SuperNOVA G3 750W 80+ Gold  PSU"", ""Tel qu'attendu"", 'Picked up the 7900X for my X299 system.Decided on the 7900X because of the higher speed compared to the more expensive ones with more cores. Simply put, games don\'t use all of these cores, and so the 7980XE not has unused potential, but what is used is slower than the 7900X.For an X299 system, the 7900X is the best CPU for gaming. You may even want to look at a Z370 system, but I want my PCIe lanes, and I want enough for full 16 on 2 video cards. If you only use 1 video card, you\'d be happy with Z370 and i7 8700k for gaming.I let my Asus Rampage VI Extreme board auto overclock this CPU, and it pulled 4.6 out of the bag. Nice!There is a problem with these CPUs though, and that problem is heat. I have a Corsair H115i AiO watercooler on it, with a push/pull configuration. Now, granted, the 280mm radiator is only like 25~30mm thick, and the tubing is small... The AiO and CPU run around 40C at idle at base speeds. That\'s 10C higher than my i7 5960X OCed at 4.2GHz. I haven\'t seen the temps go over 55C, but I haven\'t run anything like Prime95 to stress the CPU.All the kids today talk about ""delidding"" which is a risky process, and not the kind of thing you want to just try on a $900 item. Plus doing so will instantly kill your warranty. But the results are apparently much better temps.Personally, I plan on putting together my own loop and the H115i is just a temp solution. With a triple 140mm radiator that\'s 55mm thick, likely a HardwareLabs Black Ice rad, the i9 will be much more controlled. Still, it\'s a hot CPU! Maybe hotter than McDonald\'s coffee.', 'Everything works very well and smoothly, and the clock speed speaks for itself. Four cores with hyper-threading are a plus for some purposed also. On my EVGA x-299 micro, everything works smoothly and very well without overclocking. Thus far the processor has seemed very stable, smooth and responsive on the above board with 2666  ddr 4, and Crucial m-2 drive, in addition to 2 other volumes. There is no onboard graphics so one discrete video card or more is required. Also, this processor does not have a feature that is required to support Windows 11, but that really does not matter to me, because Windows 10 is still available and very similar to the former, mostly except for a few ways settings are organized. For standard, better performance, desktop use with medium high gaming, this processor and price point may be as good as one needs to be.', 'I cannot believe how poor the thermals for the 7900X are. I did very well in the silicone lottery, managing to get a chip that could achieve 4.5 Ghz stable on all cores at a mere 1.065 Vcore. Even at this remarkably low voltage, the CPU Package temps were still reaching in excess of 105C when running an Aida64 stress test, stressing the CPU and FPU - all while being cooled with a Corsair H115i, using the stock fans running at a constant 50%. The individual cores were peaking at 90-96C as well. This is simply unacceptable from a $1000 ""Extreme"" HEDT CPU. I won\'t even talk about how the VRM\'s on my Gigabyte Aorus X299 Gaming 7 mobo were reaching 110C with a Noctua 120mm fan pointed straight at them. Turns out motherboards have a hard time handling a CPU that likes to pull 300+ watts under fairly mild overclocks...I knew the temps were relatively high with non-delided X299 CPU\'s, because of the TIM (aka cheapo thermal paste) Intel uses to connect the die to the IHS. I did not expect them to be this bad. Keep in mind, with my CPU I could likely achieve a 5.0 Ghz all-core overclock with a Vcore of 1.15 to 1.175 if there was any temperature headroom in the CPU or VRM\'s at all. With a 5 Ghz overclock, this CPU would beat the Threadripper 1950X in all-core performance in addition to having WAY better single-core performance. However, even if I spent the extra time and money needed to delid my CPU (voiding the warranty), the VRM\'s on my high end, $400 motherboard would prevent me from going any higher than 4.5 Ghz anyway.So, if you are planning on custom watercooling your PC, making something like an EK monoblock a viable option for actively cooling your VRM\'s in addition to your delided CPU, then sure, X299 is probably a better buy for you than Threadripper. You\'ll be very happy with the high overclocks that will be achievable with that setup. For my needs though, this 7900X is essentially useless.I originally chose the Intel 7900X over the AMD 1950X because its single core performance is better, making it a better CPU for gaming, which I primarily do. It would still have been a notable upgrade from my 5820K in applications like Adobe Premier and Blender, which I use mainly on a hobby basis. With the ridiculous temps I am experiencing, however, the increased single core performance simply does not make up for the severely decreased multi-threaded performance I get with the 7900X when compared to a 1950X.To provide a quick example, I score 178 in Cinebench\'s single core performance test with my 7900X at 4.0 Ghz (the only clock speed I could achieve while keeping all the cores under 85C), and 2181 in the multi-threaded test. Compare this to the 1950X\'s easily attainable scores of 160 single core and 3100 multi-core (at STOCK frequencies), and there\'s just no competition from team blue.The bottom line is, unless you plan to seriously mod this CPU and the motherboard it\'s attached to, DO NOT BUY IT. Sure, the 1950X will offer slightly worse framerates in games, but I can live with that when its workstation performance is easily 30% better while using half the power and staying below 70C in stress tests.Good riddance, Intel. I\'m returning your sorry excuse for an HEDT CPU and moving to Threadripper. ""Extreme?""

Beim ganz normalen Arbeiten mit 3D Studio Max im Vordergrundund dem Berechnen von 2000 Bildern in FullHD im Hintergrund (mit Redshift), murmelt der i9 mit 45°-52°C vor sich hin.Winzip bringt ihn allerdings gerne mal an die Max-Temp (die bei mir auf 94°C eingestellt ist)...dann wird ein wenig gethrotteld(aber nur auf 4 der 36 cores)Härtetest waren das parallele (!)

(bei  Raumtemperatur von 21°C) - Stromverbrauch (gemessen): 845W (+/-10W) durchgängig.Ich denke, ich habe mit meiner CPU einen besonders guten build erwischt, denn ich habe mit allem gerechnet, nur nicht damit.Für längere Winzip-Sessions (wenn ich meine Kundendaten archiviere), werde ich die Fractal Design S36 in einen Custom-Loopumbauen, damit mir beim Packen die Kiste nicht abraucht.BTW: Cinebench ->Multithreaded : 4622 (stable)Muss man mehr dazu sagen? :)Meine ganz klare Empfehlung! ! !Danke INTEL, DAS habt ihr grandios gemacht.

The i7 7820x easily beats it by 30% so the threadripper 1900x is the same exact outcome so for a extra 20$ it was a no brainer so the moral of the story is if you plan on staying in the 400 or less bracket ryxzen is the way to go if your jumping up to a ryzen threadripper territory example the 1900x then you should go with the i7 7820x I have it oced to 4.6ghz and the highest the temp read was 74 C and its a phenomenal chip worth the price if you ask me.""]"

Gute Leistung.  Preis okay', 'Senza entrare troppo nelle specifiche tecniche che è possible trovare banalmente nel giro di pochi istanti cercando sulla rete, posso dire che è una CPU dal rapporto qualità/prezzo davvero molto elevato. Presenta 6 core fisici, per un totale di 12 thread utilizzabili. La massima frequenza single core è pari a 3,6 GHz; quando, invece, vengono usati più core, la massima frequenza raggiungibile risulta pari a 3,2 GHz. In alcuni casi possono esserci incrementi di 100 MHz se entra in funzione il sistema XFR: in altre parole, se le temperature sono accettabili, la CPU riesce, per alcuni periodi, a funzionare con un clock più elevato di quello nominale.La CPU è fornita con un dissipatore AMD Wraith Spire con pasta termica già applicata; è un sistema valido se si lascia la CPU a default o si fa leggero OC. La ventola, però, è un po\' rumorosa.Personalmente, senza voler in alcun modo essere di parte, credo che, nella fascia di prezzo a cui viene proposta questa CPU (sui 200-250 EUR), non ci siano molti motivi per preferirle un Intel i5 attuale (quindi Kaby Lake). I 1600/1600X (ma in generale tutti i Ryzen) sono overcloccabili, hanno 6 core nativi con SMT (quindi 12 thread), hanno un chip saldato (senza pasta termica come negli Intel) e quindi scaldano poco. Tranne che nel caso di 7600K (che, con tutti i 4 core attivi, arriva a 4 GHz e si può overcloccare con relativa semplicità), hanno frequenze di lavoro simili agli i5 proposti da Intel. Le prestazioni con i giochi sono praticamente sovrapponibili, mentre nei software che scalano bene con i core non c\'è proprio storia: gli R5 vincono a mani basse. Inoltre, la piattaforma Ryzen adotta il socket AM4, che, a quanto sembra, verrà usato diversi anni (quindi sarà possibile continuare ad usare le stesse schede madri); invece, il socket 1151 usato attualmente dai Kaby Lake sembra, quanto meno ad oggi, destinato a ""morire"" con questa architettura di CPU e sostituito per ospitare i futuri Cannon Lake e Coffee Lake. Credo che l\'unico vero vantaggio degli i5 sia rappresentato dalla GPU integrata che possiedono (i Ryzen ne sono sprovvisti): se non giocate o comunque non usate una GPU dedicata, allora, ad oggi, dovete necessariamente rivolgervi alle CPU Intel se volete prestazioni di un certo livello. Se voleste AMD, dovrete aspettare le future APU Raven Ridge. Concludo dicendo che, oggi come oggi, non investirei 200 EUR o più in una CPU con soli 4 core fisici. Se proprio si volesse Intel, andrei almeno di i7, dato che in ottica futura le applicazioni tenderanno sicuramente ad usare più core/thread. Ma a quel punto perché non prendere un Ryzen 7? Ognuno faccia le sue valutazioni.Per concludere:a) Rispetto al 1600, il 1600X, invece che lavorare nel range 3,2-3,6 GHz, lavora nel range 3,6-4,0 GHz; inoltre non è fornito di dissipatore e il TDP è di 95 W invece che 65 W come nel 1600. Costa più del 1600, ma se non volete fare OC, è una scelta migliore. Se non vi cambia niente, allora valutate i prezzi.b) Se volete una CPU principalmente per giocare, meglio rivolgersi agli R5 piuttosto che agli R7. Si risparmiano indicativamente 100 EUR (che si possono investire in una GPU di fascia superiore) e, ad oggi, le prestazioni a parità di frequenza sono di fatto identiche (i giochi non arrivano a sfruttare 8 core, e probabilmente non lo faranno per parecchio tempo).c) Prendete delle RAM veloci: l\'interconnessione Infinity Fabric su cui si basano le CPU Ryzen dipende dalla frequenza delle RAM, quindi, ad oggi, potrebbe essere una buona idea prendere almeno delle 3200 16 (che hanno ancora prezzi ""accettabili""; nel caso, affrettatevi, perché pare che i prezzi siano destinati ad aumentare nei prossimi mesi). Personalmente, posso dire che con scheda madre Asus Prime X370 Pro e RAM Corsair Vengeance LPX CMK16GX4M2B3200C16 non riesco ad andare come da specifica XMP (ovvero 3200MHz 16-18-18-36 1.35V), ma tramite D.O.C.P. a 2933MHz 16-18-18-36-69-1T 1.35V. Tuttavia sono tranquillo, in quanto AMD ha annunciato che a maggio il supporto alle RAM verrà esteso e migliorato con gli aggiornamenti dei BIOS delle schede madri.Se vi servono altre informazioni, chiedete pure, nel caso aggiornerò questa recensione nel futuro.---------------------------------Aggiornamento 27/04/2017Dopo alcuni test posso spiegare meglio il funzionamento del XFR con questa CPU (tenuta ad impostazioni di fabbrica). Quando è caricato al massimo un singolo thread, il core relativo al thread in questione si porta a 3,7 GHz. Non l\'ho mai visto andare a 3,6 GHz come da specifica. Quando invece si caricano tutti i thread, tutti i moltiplicatori si impostano a 34x, e quindi la frequenza di ogni core è circa 3,4 GHz (dico ""circa"" perché il bus clock non è esattamente 100 MHz ma 99,8 MHz). Se la temperatura del core supera i 65 °C, i moltiplicatori iniziano a scendere a step di 25 MHz portandosi, fino a 70 °C, intorno a 33,75-33,50x. Questi sono i risultati da me ottenuti con la ventola fornita nella confezione (con profilo di velocità alto ma non massimo) e Prime95. Si può concludere, quindi, che a default: 1) la CPU non lavora praticamente mai a 3,2-3,6 GHz come dichiarato, ma a 3,4-3,7 GHz; 2) se si vogliono avere le frequenze più alte possibile, è opportuno non superare 65 °C nel core.Usando un dissipatore Noctua D9H e pasta termoconduttiva Noctua, quando tutti i core sono sotto carico con Prime95 il core difficilmente supera i 60 °C (anche in questo caso la ventola non è al massimo e funziona a regimi ben più bassi della Wraith Spire). La silenziosità è completamente a vantaggio del dissipatore Noctua.', 'Tiene el mejor costo para los equipo de alto desempeñoBUENO (comparación realizado en el 5 de octubre del 2017):- Sin Overclock (3.20GHz): está entre los 4% CPU más rápidos del mundo (Percentil 96, con CPU mark de 12643)- Con Overclock1 (3.77GHz, 3.0V): está entre los 2% CPU más rápidos del mundo (Percentil 98, con CPU mark de 13941)- Con Overclock2 (3.85GHz, 3.5V): está entre los 2% CPU más rápidos del mundo (Percentil 98, con CPU mark de 14200)- Trabaja con 12 procesos simultáneos (6 procesadores con 2 nucleos cada)- Bajo consumo de energía: Sin overclock (11W minimo; 73W máximo); Con overclock1 (17W mínimo; 105W máximo); Con Overclock2 (21W mínimo, 130W Máximo)BONITO, está diseñado con todas las tecnologías más modernas:- Soporta memoria DDR4: trae canales especializados para optimizar el acceso a las memorias DDR4- Soporta almacenamiento SSD NVMe nativo: trae canales especializados en PCIe para lograr máxima velocidad sin afectar el ancho de banda PCIe- Soporta optimización del consumo de energía por cada núcleo- Soporta realización de Overclock (incremeto de velocidad) en todos los modelos de la categoría RyzenBARATO, comparado con las opciones de la competencia (INTEL):- Por el mismo precio de lo que cuesta un procesador Intel generación 7, tienes un desempeño aproximadamente 40% mejor- Este procesador debe soportar varios años antes de tener que cambiarlo, esto es debido a que su desempeño está entre los 4% más rápidos del mundo (Percentil 94)- Puedes hacer Overclock sin tener que pagar más por una versión ""liberada para Overclock""- No necesita comprar disipador para hacer Overclock.

Il 1600x è venduto senza dissipatore, ma il 1600 ne è provvisto: si porta facilmente a 3,7ghz in overclock con il dissipatore incluso e se abbinato a una scheda madre B350 (100€ circa) si ha una potenza di fuoco semplicemente impressionante in questa fascia di prezzo. L' i5 di Intel non può certo competere. Senza contare che questa piattaforma rimarrà valida per anni e potrete aggiornare a zen2/3/4.. Non bisogna però lesinare troppo sulla frequenza della ram perché ryzen ne va ghiotto.Fino ad ora l' i5 serie K di Intel è stata la scelta numero 1 per gli appassionati di gaming, grazie alla fama guadagnata dai suoi predecessori di offrire grossomodo le stesse performance dell' i7 ma ad un prezzo più vantaggioso (che permette di indirizzare il resto del budget su ciò che più conta: la scheda video). Ma sarà ancora così? Non proprio. Non è certo un cattivo processore, ma di anno in anno il divario si è allargato e ormai 4core/4thread è davvero troppo poco per assicurare una fluidità stabile. Nei giochi infatti arranca, con fps minimi bassi, cali di framerate che creano quel fastidioso stuttering di tanto in tanto. Per non parlare delle modeste capacità in multithreading, che lo azzoppano in ogni altro utilizzo.Ryzen 5 offre 6 core/12 thread, performance a singolo thread competitive mentre in multithreading fa anche meglio del i7-7700k, e nei giochi è pressoché al livello di ryzen7, l' 8-core top di gamma.L' r5 1600x ha la frequenza più alta, ma il 1600 è comunque sbloccato per cui si può facilmente colmare il distacco tramite overclock. Inoltre quest'ultimo è fornito anche di dissipatore, sufficiente per portarlo sui 3,7ghz. Da notare che entrambi hanno lo stesso limite in OC, che è lo stesso di Ryzen7, attorno a 4ghz. Se poi si abbina il 1600 a una scheda madre B350 – che come limite hanno solo quello di non offrire la possibilità di configurazioni a doppia scheda video, e 4 porte SATA – e ram ddr4-3200mhz si ha una configurazione estremamente potente per il prezzo.Ma quali sono le alternative?r5 1600/x vs i7 7700k: Certo nei giochi quest'ultimo rimane imbattuto, sebbene solo a certe condizioni. A 1080p con una rx480 o una gtx 1060/1070, il divario tra i due è irrilevante; solo andando oltre con la potenza della scheda video, allora ryzen diventa un fattore limitante e determina una percentuale di utilizzo della gpu di un 5-10% inferiore rispetto ad Intel. Ma non è uno scenario realistico o comunque di nicchia; chi sceglie una gpu che può gestire i 4k per giocare invece a 1080p? E se allora non è il vostro caso, perché prendere un 4core ad un prezzo superiore, quando si può avere un 6core non solo competitivo, ma anche più versatile se si vuole essere produttivi? Senza contare che ryzen può solo migliorare, come si è già visto in appena poche settimane dal lancio e trarre beneficio da maggiori ottimizzazioni. Il futuro va comunque nella direzione di più core.r5 1600/x vs r7 1700: il processore alla base è lo stesso, stesso margine di OC; la differenza sono i 2 core in più che si fanno sentire in ambito produttivo. Ma non aspettatevi miglioramenti nei giochi. Se non sapete che uso fare del maggior numero di core, è bene reindirizzare il budget su altri componenti (come scheda video / ram), 6 core sono più che adeguati per una macchina capace e longeva.r5 1600/x vs i5 7600k: paragone improponibile. Stesso prezzo, ma va peggio anche nei giochi se si considerano i minimi, offre scarsa versatilità, e ha già imboccato la strada verso l'obsolescenza. I quad-core sono ancora rilevanti, non sono da buttare sia chiaro.. ma investire oggi su di essi? Non lo consiglierei in nessun caso.Riguardo la scelta della RAM tenete presente che l'Infinity Fabric, l'interconnessione tra i vari componenti del processore e i due CCX (da 3 core ciascuno per ryzen5), è sincronizzato con la frequenza della memoria con un rapporto 2:1 (ad esempio DDR4-2133 → 1066Mhz). Usare  ram più veloce ha un impatto diretto su questa interconnessione, e quindi sulle performance in generale.Date un'occhiata alla lista di memorie compatibili con la mobo, ma in genere le ram con chip samsung “b-die” arrivano fino a 3200mhz, mentre con samsung “e-die” fino a 2933mhz, almeno per ora. Per maggio sono attesi infatti miglioramenti sul fronte ram, così come il supporto per velocità maggiori di 3200mhz. Consiglio di risparmiare sulla cpu (1600 liscio) e sulla mobo (b350), ma non sulla ram: 2x8gb cl16 3600mhz, ma anche cl 14/15 3200mhz sarebbero l'ideale.. peccato per i prezzi che sono saliti alle stelle da qualche mese e non scenderanno sino a fine anno secondo le attese.Insomma se si deve acquistare un pc oggi, non ha più senso investire su un quattro core sovraprezzato e una piattaforma morente; meglio puntare su ryzen5 1600 che è il miglior processore in circolazione nel rapporto prezzo/performance, e su una piattaforma che sarà in grado anche di ospitare le future generazioni di cpu ryzen."", 'Myth 1  ‘You cannot install Windows 7 on Ryzen or an m.2 SSD.’Myth 2  ‘You cannot run the Windows USB Installation Tool from another win7 machine, use 8 or 10.’My win7 install was to be on the gigabyte GA-AB350 gaming 3, ryzen 5 1600, and samsung 960 evo 500gb. The Windows USB installation tool would not run for what I now know was several reasons.As someone who struggled with this as well in several stages, but appear to have siphoned the best practices from the interwebs as a couple of additions, it\'s all I can do to help others save their time. I plan on posting this on the 3 related items since I was unable to post on the blog that helped me along the way.Before we begin, 2 important items for those pulling their hair out or unsure if they can succeed with what they have available.Ensure you have updated your BIOS to the latest version. In my case, it was F22. It shipped with F7!Also, ensure your new SSD is the only storage device attached to the board.1. Obtain your .iso of windows 7 from MS\'s download page if you have not already.2. Format your flash drive as FAT32 and mount the iso image to the drive using the Windows USB/DVD Download Tool, also a MS download. The drive is now bootable but needs to be tweaked with the new USB drivers.3. Obtain the Windows USB Installation Tool from gigabyte or potentially other mfrs. Do NOT unzip it yet.4.**IMPORTANT** While the .zip file is still an un-extracted .zip file, right-click it, properties, and unblock it. This will prevent you from spending a long time unblocking individual files later.5. **IMPORTANT** Extract the .zip file to a very short directory name such as the root of a drive as many have suggested (thank you).6. Run the Windows USB Installation Tool and it will take 8-12 minutes if everything is going well. If any issues, run the tool as an administrator.7. After completion, add any other storage drivers to the flash drive you might need during installation, i.e. NVMe below. No particular path or steps, you can browse to them.8. Safely remove your flash drive and use it in one of the USB 2.0 ports at the top of your new board.9. Power on, F12 for boot menu, install windows 7, hopefully :) And be quite pleased you can use your OS you own outright and is still ""supported"".A note from step 7: google \'Howto Install Windows 7 on a Samsung SSD 960 Pro (M2)\' for assistance extracting the newest driver from the Samsung executable (that requires the drive to already be installed to run). I did not attempt installation using the NVMe driver that was included in the Windows USB Installation Tool, as it was an earlier version and I was not certain of 960 evo compatibility. Once the files were extracted to c:/program files/samsung, I just added them to the flash drive and pointed to them during windows installation.', 'Easy to install, and worked without error for day one.', 'Ho acquistato questa cpu Ryzen per il nuovo Pc che ho assemblato, l\'utilizzo del pc è per gaming ed editing e sicuramente questo processore mi sta dando delle soddisfazioniPartiamo dall\'imballaggio: è arrivato insieme ad altre parti per il pc in un ampio scatolone riempito con pezzi di carta per evitare che i vari prodotti urtassero, sono quindi soddisfatto della protezione.Il processore è inscatolato in una bella confezione di forma cubica la quale all\'interno contiene: la CPU, il dissipatore wraith spire SENZA LED, un foglietto infromativo e un adesivo da attaccare al computer di bella fattura. Il tutto è contornato da apposite plastiche trasparenti ad incastro in modo da tenere tutto separato e protetto.Esteticamente sulla CPU c\'è poco da dire se non di fare attenzione ai PIN di connessione in quanto ovviamente fragili; è invece utile parlare del dissipatore: si presente di dimensioni generose e di ottima fattura con una ventola da 90mm, la qualità costruttiva del dissipatore boxed è sicuramente migliore della controparte intel la quale spesso presenta dei dissipatori non conformi ai processori che vende. Questo dissipatore tiene ottime temperature a stock con idle a 33° e in pieno stress test a 70°, il tutto in un case non troppo aerato e che ha solo una ventolada 140mm anteriore e una 120mm posteriore. In overclock le temperature non sono molto piu alte ma ovviamente non si può spingere al limite la CPU con il dissipatore stock onde evitare di cuocere il chip.La CPU: montata la cpu su una scheda madre msi Tomahawk b350 posso rilevare che a stock funziona alla perfezione, in multithread è veramente una bomba, mentre in single trhead vista la ""bassa"" frequenza funziona bene ma per spingere giochi un pò piu pesanti necessita di overclock, la frequenza che grazie alle nuove tecnologie AMD raggiunge il chip arriva fino a punte di 3,7ghz con un minimo di 3,2ghz ma nel mio pc con le condizioni che trova sta stabile a 3,4ghzOverclock: parlando subito di overclock posso dire che questo chip probabilmente non è stato dei migliori nella silicon lottery, le ram non riescono a salire a piu di 2933 e per mantere frequenze alte bisogna salire molto con il voltaggio. Nello specifico a frequenza 3,65ghz devo usare 1,25v a 3,75ghz 1,31v fino ad arrivare a 3,975ghz a 1,45v. Oltre non mi sono spinto visto che AMD consiglia di non superare quella soglia e visto che non possiedo al momento un dissipatore aftermarket.CONTRO se non viene overlockato nel single thread soffre un pò e sta al pari di processori intel di 4° generazione.  L\'architettura acerba crea problemi con le memoriePRO  Con un pò di overclock arriva a prestazione simili in single thread a un 6700k intel e in multithread devasta anche processori per piattaforma x99 rendendolo più che utilizzabile per uso gaming enthusiast e per editing a buon livelloSe non avete un budget più alto questa CPU è veramente bang for the buck', 'Tras 4 meses de uso puedo decir que es perfecto, el mejor procesador relación calidad-precio. No se queda atrás en ningún aspecto, lo he usado para editar fotos en Photoshop y Lightroom, para editar video en Premiere y para jugar y es muy potente en todos los ámbitos con sus 6 núcleos y 12 hilos, nunca me ha dejado tirado en ningún sentido, puede con todo. Además otra cosa que me encanta de este procesador es la temperatura, generalmente si no estás haciendo nada, con el disipador que viene incluido se encuentra a unos 35-37 grados, a carga media (es decir, navegar por internet, usar Word, etcétera) no sube de los 45 grados y cuanda realizas un uso más intenso con programas de edición y videojuegos se queda a una temperatura de unos 60 grados, es muy pero que muy fresquito, no se calienta casi nada gracias a que el encapsulado viene soldado al silicio. La máxima temperatura que he conseguido lograr con el es de 67 grados con un test de estrés tras unos 15 minutos con el test, y de ahí no subía, y eso que esa situación es prácticamente imposible alcanzarla en una situación real, nunca le vamos a pedir tanto al procesador, por lo que nunca va a llegar a esa temperatura, que ya de por sí es muy baja, y más si la comparamos con las de los procesadores de Intel. Lo que me parece espectacular es que esa temperatura es con el disipador que viene incluido, chapó por el trabajo que ha hecho AMD con este procesador y este disipador. Es que si encima le pones un disipador algo mejor o refrigeración líquida ya alucinas. Además he tenido suerte y mi procesador venía de base a 3.4 gigahercios, cuando indica en Amazon y en el embalaje que viene a 3.2 así que además de tener más potencia tiene más mérito el tema de la temperatura.En resumen, no he tenido ningún problema con él (salvo el tema de las memorias RAM, ya que tengo unas memorias a 3866 megahercios y lo máximo que he sido capaz de ponerlas es a 3333 megahercios y eran bastante inestables, las tuve que bajar a 3200 para que fuesen estables, algo que, sin duda,  tiene que trabajar AMD para la próxima generación de Ryzen), ha sido una compra muy acertada y estoy muy contento con este procesador, recomiendo su compra, yo lo volvería a comprar. Excelente trabajo de AMD', ""Portentoso questo CPU della AMD.Un paio di spanne avanti rispetto la controparte Intel. Ottimo nel multithreading, arranca un pelo nelle chiamate in single.Apre sicuramente le porte ad una nuova forma di pensiero e progettazione di giochi e software non più limitati e basati soltanto sul single threading.6-core / 12-thread corredati dal dissipatore stock davvero di ottima qualità, bella presenza e non malaccio per prestazioni leggermente potenziate, ovvero un OC delicato non spinto al limite.Niente led nell'anello della ventola del dissipatore come invece presente nei fratelloni a partire dal ryzen 7.Prezzo convenientissimo e come suggeriscono in tanto non  vale praticamente la pena investire sulla versione 1600X poichè si perde il dissipatore e una gestione manuale dell'OC.Tenuto stock o con frequenza leggermente maggiorata la CPU non risente minimanete del carico di lavoro nè le temperature salgono in modo preoccupante (E lì è chiaro che dipende dalla ventilazione genrale del case e dal settaggio della ventola del dissi).La rete è piena di dati e paragoni tecnici fra le varie versioni e i concorrenti Intel.ATTENZIONE=========Attualmente il prezzo del 1600 è assolutamente invitante attorno ai 150 / 160 euro (ben meno di quanto l'ho pagato io a dicembre) lo rende un best buy per budget contenuti pur puntando ad una performance di tutto rispetto.Questo perchè è già uscita la seconda serie di Ryzen e tutti attendono l'altrettanto strepitoso Ryzen 5 2600 che poreta in dote un chip grafico integrato derivato dal progetto delle schede video top gamma della AMD.Se siete indecisi aspetterei l'uscita su Amazon del 2600 e valuterei il prezzo. Se siete di fretta e badate al risparmio, volendo certamente investire su una GPU da competizione, beh andrei sul 1600 senza pensieri, portandomi a casa anche un dissipatore di tutto rispetto con ulteriore risparmio di circa 30-35 euro del corrispettivo after market.ATTENZIONE 2 ==========cambiate istantaneamente l'adesivo termico del dissipatore con una pasta termica decente. Una Artic Mx-4  la si trova a 4 - 5 euro, io stavolta ho lasciato l'Artic per una spaventosamente performante Cooler Master.La differenza è sostanziale e di svariati gradi sotto sforzo.Ora come ora a distanza di mesi, lo ricomprerei ad occhi chiusi. Brava AMD!Spero la mia esperienza vi aiuti nella scelta. Buone compere :)RobiDì"", 'This is the processor that started off the entire dominance held by AMD over Intel for a few years now. When this came out at full RRP (£200+), it was worth every penny and I have absolutely no doubt this will be the ""go-to"" processor for making ultra-budget builds in the future for office workstations, now that the price is less than half it\'s original asking... or maybe it\'s U-series variants, who really knows? They\'re all honestly brilliant.It\'s compatible with the extremely basic A-series motherboards, all B-series boards and some X-series boards without needing updates, for a full list always check the specification from the website itself as new BIOS will be released over time increasing compatibility. It\'s also very easy to mount on the motherboard itself, almost impossible to get wrong - just make sure you line up the right corner while has a symbol on both the processor and the AM4 socket.The Wraith Spire cooler is just phenomenal, AMD\'s competitors would never include a cooler at the price range the Ryzen series started out with. I did run into a little issue but I found out when installing the cooler, it\'s best to do so in a ""cross"" shape, to apply even pressure across all 4 screws at once. The cooler itself isn\'t RGB but does a great job of keeping it cool under very heavy loads. I would recommend buying third party thermal paste as standard - it will give you a few more FPS under max temps for minimal cost.Performance is phenomenal for the time this chip was released - video editing with this outclasses laptops over 10x its current asking price. It\'s getting a little outdated now (2019) and I would recommend waiting out the new socket AMD will probably bring to the market in 1/2 years if you can wait that long but if you need a simple workhorse PC now for anything that isn\'t intensive gaming, this is a fantastic budget choice.Five stars.

On peut trouver du i7 7700k pour à peu près le même prix sur des sites comme LDLC ou materiel.net sauf que le Ryzen 7 1700x a le double de coeur et est bien plus polyvalent et ""futureproof"" comme on dit que son concurrent en termes de prix. Alors oui, il est un peu en retrait en gaming par rapport à ce dernier mais honnêtement ça ne sert à rien de les comparer à ce niveau sauf si vous êtes dans le gaming compétitif et que vous avez besoin de 140 fps et au-delà. Et encore, le R7 1700x y arrivera très bien dans des jeux comme Overwatch ou CS:GO avec de très bons graphismes si le GPU suit donc c\'est un peu un faux argument en faveur du Intel. N\'oublions pas non plus qu\'en jeu, quand le 7700k est utilisé à 100%, on a le 1700x qui est utilisé vers 30-45% maximum. Il en a donc bien plus sous le capot, ce qui peut servir si vous faites beaucoup de multitâche en arrière plan en plus de jouer.Avec le R7 1700x vous aurez la possibilité, contrairement au i7 7700k de faire bien plus de choses en même temps sans que votre PC ne rame, notamment si vous faites de l\'encodage vidéo en même temps que de jouer. Sur son concurrent de chez Intel ce sera quasi impraticable car il est encore limité à 4 coeurs et 8 threads alors qu\'avec le 1700x vous pourrez faire ça tranquillement, et pas avoir à laisser votre encodage tourner et devoir vous occuper sans votre PC.Aussi, au niveau du stream, vous pouvez partir si vous n\'avez pas le budget vers un Ryzen 5 avec 6 coeurs mais pour avoir testé le 1700x sur twitch, je peux vous dire qu\'il est excellent: aucun drop de fps avec une gtx 1080. Si vous streamez et que vous avez le budget vous pouvez foncer dessus. Il ne faut pas oublier en général qu\'en termes applicatifs il est en concurrence avec un i7 5960x voire du i7 6900k qui sont des processeurs à plus de 1000€ avec le même nombre de coeurs.Aussi, pour avoir vu et fait des tests à la même fréquence (j\'appuie sur le fait que ce soit à fréquence identique) entre les Ryzen 7 et les derniers i7 Kabylake et Broadwell-E, les IPC (instructions per clock) de Ryzen sont légèrement supérieures à celles d\'Intel contrairement à ce qu\'on pourrait penser. Vous êtes donc plus malins de prendre ce processeur plutôt qu\'un intel au même prix voire plus cher, surtout qu\'Intel change très souvent de plateforme ce qui oblige à changer de carte-mère en plus du processeur. AMD a dit que la plateforme AM4 devrait rester aux alentours de 2020, vous avez donc le temps !Pour les joueurs qui hésitent entre ce processeur et le i7 7700k n\'oubliez pas non plus qu\'Intel sort la génération Coffe Lake d\'ici quelques mois, avec en flagship un 6 coeurs 12 threads... pour le mainstream. Ça veut donc dire que les jeux vont avoir encore plus tendances à être optimisés pour des CPU avec plus de 4 coeurs (on a aussi les consoles qui ont des APU avec bien plus de 4c). On a déjà des prémices avec des jeux comme Battlefield 1. Vous ferez donc mieux d\'acheter un 8c/16t au même prix qu\'un 4c/8t maintenant.Le défaut de tous les Ryzen: l\'overclockingAvec une fréquence de base de 3.4GHz et un turbo sur tous les coeurs de 3.5GHz, on n\'a malheureusement pas beaucoup de possibilité d\'aller bien plus haut avec le 1700X tout comme avec tous les processeurs Ryzen. C\'est sans doute un de leurs plus grands défauts. En effet, on peut en général pas les faire monter à plus de 4.1GHz avec du très bon air-cooling comme avec de l\'AIO (all-in-one) ou du watercooling custom sauf en y mettant un voltage bien élevé du style 1,45 volts et plus. Pour celui que j\'ai acheté pour mon ami (j\'ai personnellement un 1800x et j\'ai pu tester tous les R7), on a pu atteindre 4GHz sur les 8 coeurs avec un corsair H60 et avec 1,35 volts, ce qui est plutôt pas trop mal. Aller au-dessus demande un meilleur refroidissement car plus de volts et on a pas pu aller plus loin.PS: Pour les inquiets de la RAM avec les Ryzen, vérifiez bien sur le site constructeur de votre carte mère si vous avez une mise à jour vers l\'AGESA 1.0.0.6 qui règle la très grande majorité des instabilités et incompatibilités RAM. Vous trouverez sur reddit, les sites des constructeurs et youtube plein d\'infos à ce niveauEN RÉSUMÉ: Si vous voulez UNIQUEMENT jouer à des fréquences très élevées du genre 140-240 fps (et que vous avez l\'écran qui va avec évidemment) vous pouvez aller sur du i7 7700k au même prix mais il vous faudra le changer plus rapidement compte tenu des optimisations de jeux à venir. Pour tous les autres qui ont le budget pour se faire plaisir, en ont l\'utilité ou qui veulent simplement bien investir leur argent tout en jouant ""raisonnablement"" (en 60-75 fps quoi) prenez plutôt le R7 1700x, il vieillira bien mieux ! C\'est la fin de l\'ère des 4 coeurs pour le grand public !', 'Este procesador es ideal para aquellos que quieran renderizar o utilizar programas de diseño. No hay ningún procesador que le pueda dar batalla por este rango de precio. A nivel de juegos, tampoco tiene ningún problema. No tengáis miedo por la gente que diga que tal o cual Intel va mejor porque mueve casi todos (o todos) los videojuegos sin ningún problema. Lo que te podría limitar el poder jugar a el videojuego 1 o al videojuego 2 es la tarjeta gráfica que compres, que es donde estaría la diferencia en poder jugar o no, ya que este procesador es demasiado potente para cualquier videojuego y lo será por lo menos unos años más.', ""First, system specs:ASRock X370 Taichi board16 GB (2X8) Team T Force Nighthawk DDR4 3200 RAMSapphire R9 280X (1080p)Kingston Hyper X 3K 120 GB SSD for OSWindows 10 Home 64 BitThis was an upgrade from an FX 8320 OC to 4.2 Ghz and 990FX board. Most components were carried over to the Ryzen system. I must say, this is a very noticeable increase in performance! This CPU takes anything I throw at it and doesn't even break a sweat. Handbrake encode times on my custom settings are less than 1/4 the time it took the FX to complete, Blender renders much faster, games are smoother with higher frame rates, and the list goes on. It was well worth the upgrade. Even with the dated and aging GPU I have seen average frame rate gains as high as 50% over the 8320. The AGESA 1006a BIOS update (V3.0 for this board) seems to have solved the early memory problems and stability issues. My board has no issue using the XMP profile for 3200 RAM with the correct timings and the system is fully stable. Shop around and be very selective on your RAM choice. DDR4 3200 is the fastest supported so far, but this will likely change in time. Get the fastest you can, Ryzen performance gains are pretty much linear up to DDR4 3600.The Ryzen platform still has some rough edges that need smoothing out, but it is at the point now where it will run fine in most any circumstance. For such a new platform, I'm surprised at how well it works. I've not had any stability issues at all. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this CPU and platform. I'm not even going to bother overclocking it yet, it's plenty fast enough for me.This CPU runs very, very cool. Temp monitoring software reports the 1700X and 1800X at 20 degrees Celsius higher than it actually is. Subtracting the 20 degrees, the highest I've seen is 52 degrees running handbrake, and 54 degrees under heavy gaming load. It hovers around 35 degrees when browsing the net. I'm using a Corair H 60 AIO cooler. It is also extremely efficient. I have seen ~96 watts or so under heavy load, and 20-35 during internet browsing.XFR boosting is an absolutely awesome thing! This CPU with the H 60 regularly runs at 3.5 GHz on all cores, and boosts as high as 3.9 GHz when using less cores.Things to consider:I actually was going to get the Ryzen 5 1600X, but the sale price for the 1700X made me go after it instead. The 1600X is roughly equal to or faster compared to the 1700X at stock clocks in games. So if all you're doing is gaming, that's the top choice. If you (Like me) do other things as well such as rendering, video encoding, photo shopping, or CAD work, the 1700X makes more sense. It is also likely a bit more future proof than the hex core Ryzens are as well.Get a good cooler if getting one of the X models! They do not come with a cooler (As of the date I bought mine). The non X CPU's have a very nice stock cooler. The Corsair H 60 is more than enough for this beast at stock clocks and is dead silent. There are many great air coolers out there, too. Just look for one that comes with the AM4 bracket. Most companies will send one separately if the cooler doesn't come with it.TLDR; This CPU is more than enough to handle anything you want to do. It is a massive upgrade from anything older (2008-2014), especially any FX CPU and quad cores. Ryzen is about 76% faster than Piledriver (FX) clock for clock! I am very happy with it and recommend it to anyone looking to build a new system."", ""Bonjour,J'ai acheté ce processeur, car cela faisait longtemps que je souhaitais changer mon vieux 2600K, seulement il fallait une bonne raison, et les 10% de plus par génération offert pas Intel ne me paraissaient pas du tout justifier les hausses de prix.Pour l'aspect esthétique, rapidement, la boite et très classe et le processeur estampillé Ryzen très beau. Mais cela n'est pas le plus important puis qu'on ne le verra pas.Voici mon avis :- L'installation se fait sur un socket AM4 d'AMD, les pins étant sur le processeur et non plus sur la carte mère je n'ai plus peur d'abimer celle-ci, et je ne me demande plus si le problème viendrait pas d'un pin tordu de la carte mère quand celle-ci à un comportement étrange. Premier bon point.- Les performances qui sont vraiment au top pour tout les logiciels professionnels que j'utilise. Je n'ai pour l'instant, jamais eu le moindre soucis de latence avec ce processeur. La seule chose que je lui reproche sont ses performances sur Winrar, qui gère très mal ce processeur, les performances restent bonnes, mais bien en deçà de ce qu'on peut attendre d'un 8 cœurs.Ce processeur montre réellement toutes ses capacités dans le multitâches, pour un streamer par exemple, c'est la perfection : Jouez, Filmez, Uploadez, sans que cela n'impacte jamais les performances en jeu.- L'overclocking est facile et pouvant facilement faire gagner 25% de performance pour ceux qui ont en besoin, je n'ai jamais vu un modèle 1700X ne pas atteindre les 4,0Ghz. Cependant, c'est régulièrement une fréquence plancher pour beaucoup de modèle, et de ce point de vue là, le 1700 est préférable au 1700X. Déjà il n'a pas d'offset de 20 degré sur la température, et il est plus ou moins capable d'atteindre les mêmes fréquences. le 1700X et 1800X sont à privilégiés pour ceux qui ne comptent pas overclocker.- Les températures si non overclocké, le processeur a un très bon comportement sous watercooling AIO, ne chauffant pas de trop et ne mettant pas à mal la durée de vie des autres composants.- Le coup de pied dans la fourmillière : Alors qu'Intel nous fait croire qu'il a rien de mieux que des 4 cores, on voit depuis la sorti des processeurs d'AMD qu'Intel nous cachait beaucoup de chose et faisait de la veille technologique sur le dos des consommateurs, tout en ne baissant jamais ses tarifs, AMD a mit fin à ça avec ses nouveau processeur et c'est une bonne chose pour les consommateurs."", ""Comprato subito appena uscito, dopo numerose ricerche.Ero indeciso tra due modelli, il 1600x oppure questo e alla fine mi sono lasciato tentare dai 2 core in piu'  ;) anche se la spesa e' salita abbastanza...Per ora il processore si dimostra davvero ottimo, credo che quest anno sara' Amd ha dominare nuovamente il mercato dei processori!Ho scelto le versioni ''X'' per via del fatto che le loro frequenze sono gia' piu' elevate di fabbrica rispetto alle versioni ''normali'' che invece andrebbero overclockate manualmente.IL processore e' fenomenale .. ha raddoppiato il punteggio nel single core rispetto al mio vecchio Amd fx6350  6core..

I must say its impressive how far AMD has come since its last generation.  There was nothing from Intel that could beat this in price and performance.  The motherboard i bought with it was the ""GIGABYTE GA-AB350-Gaming 3"" which was on sale for just over 100 dollars.  Just amazing value here.  Similar Intel motherboard and cpu would have set me back almost double the cost and had no noticeable gains for me.I got this to replace an old 2600k cpu.  So far its literally twice as fast in benchmarks i\'ve run on it compared to my 2600k that was overclocked to 4.6ghz.... and its 3 times faster than my 8 core bulldozer cpu i had.  But its single threaded performance is just slightly better over the 2600k, but still good enough that you could easily game on this unless you are a 144/200hz gamer.  Someone running 60 to 75hz will easily hit those framerates with this.  Likely over 100fps in most games if they use the threads.  Unless a game is horribly optimized and a complete cpu hog that only runs on 1-2 threads, this cpu should run games good.  But i\'m actually using this cpu for mainly heavily threaded applications and won\'t be gaming on it much.Comparing it with the 2600k i7, i did a power test on it, and it uses about 25-30 watts less power at idle than my 4.6ghz overclocked 2600k.  I assume it uses over 60-80 watts less power than my bulldozer cpu but i didnt test it directly to it.Since it was the 1700x I got, it didn\'t come with a cooler, so i bought a Noctua NH-U12S SE-AM4 to cool it.  It works well, the temps keep the 1700x at 31-32c at idle, and 42c at 30% cpu usage, and 63-64c at 100% usage (older version of prime95 was used to max cpu, 20 min test).I think one thing to look out for is VRM temps on these ryzen motherboards, they get really hot.  At 100% cpu usage i noticed my vrm temp hit a max of around 112c.  But when i put a small 80mm fan above the heatsink of the VRM, dropped the temps to 65c under the same load.  But under mild load the vrm won\'t hit 112c, so this all depends on how long your cpu will be hitting 100% load and how long you want your capacitors on your motherboard to survive.  A simple fan above the heatsink gives you a lot of cooling on it and makes you feel safer by cutting those temps in half.  Fortunately the motherboard i got let me monitor those temps and fix the problem easily with some airflow.So i\'m happy with this cpu, if you can get it on sale its a steal.  This cpu can do everything i need, and am looking forward to what AMD can do with other ryzen cpus in the future.  I haven\'t tried to overclock this at all and probably won\'t since i\'m getting enough performance from it.  From what i heard you can only overclock them up to 4ghz or so, and its hard to know if its worth the extra power usage for small gains, i\'d have to look into it further.', 'Bonjour,Ce processeur est absolument exceptionnel pour le travail. Couplé à une carte mère X370 et de la RAM 3000mhz ce Processeur écrase tout la compétition en terme de puissance.Non seulement Intel n\'a rien à proposer d\'équivalent à moins du double du prix, mais en plus les CPU sont beaucoup plus chauds et tirent beaucoup plus de Watts. Donc non seulement chez Intel vous payez plus cher aujourd\'hui, mais en plus vous payez plus cher sur le long terme, sans compter que la température élevée du lineup actuel d\'Intel rend la durée de vie de leur processeur plus courte.Comptez également les cartes mère Intel sont beaucoup plus chère (sans rien offrir de plus vu qu\'Intel a inventé un système honteux qui est de faire vendre des cartes mères plein prix avec toutes les fonctionnalités (RAID, Lanes PCIe disponibles) MAIS les fonctionnalités réellement utilisées dépendent du Processeur que vous achetez... Donc en gros chez Intel c\'est ""achetez-vous des cartes mère à plus de 250EUR avec plein de trucs sympa, mais si vous voulez les utilisez, achetez vous les processeurs à 1000EUR"".Pour moi le choix est très simple aujourd\'hui:- vous cherchez un processeur de jeu: achetez-vous un 7700K chez Intel ou un R5 1600 chez AMD si vous êtes un peu plus court au niveau du budget.- vous cherchez un processeur de calcul / rendering: achetez vous un R7 chez AMD, Intel n\'a rien à proposer d\'équivalent si ce n\'est au double du prix.- vous cherchez un processeur HEDT: achetez vous un Threadripper (1920X - 1950X) d\'AMD. Pour le même prix qu\'Intel (1950X d\'AMD vs 7900X d\'Intel) ils sont 30% plus puissants, plus froids et consomment moins d\'électricité. Pour la même puissance que chez Intel, ils sont 25% moins chers (1920X), sans comptez les lanes PCIe qui sont non seulement plus nombreuses chez AMD, mais également TOUTES débloquées, contrairement à Intel.Concernant mon expérience du processeur il tourne à 3.6ghz sur tous les coeurs, 50C. Celà est fait avec l\'outil ""Sapphire Power Boost"" intégrée au BIOS d\'AsRock, donc aucun problème de garantie.J\'espère vous avoir aidé.', 'Ich möchte hier gleich mal mit den zu erwartenden Problemen dieses Prozessors anfangen, damit sich Käufer darauf vorbereiten können.1. Stabilitätsprobleme unter älteren Versionen von Windows 10 (prä Millenium-Update): Als ich den Prozessor zum ersten mal genutzt habe, habe ich Windows 10 komplett neu installiert mit einer Boot-CD, die ich irgendwann Ende 2015/Anfang 2016 erstellt habe. Meine Güte war das nervig den Fehler zu finden, wenn alle 5 Minuten der PC abstürzt. Ich hatte erst gedacht es wäre meine SSD, weil am Stromanschluss beim Umbau ein Stück abgebrochen ist und da ein Wackler entstanden ist. Nach einem schnellen Besuch im Saturn und einer neuen SSD blieb das Problem und ich habe erst mal 140€ zusätzlich ausgegeben. Es stellte sich dann heraus, dass der Ryzen Prozessor unter älteren Versionen von Windows 10 massive Stabilitätsprobleme hat. Es empfiehlt sich also für eine Neuinstallation schnell noch eine neue Windows 10 ISO runterzuladen (geht ja eh alles gratis). Seitdem allerdings (bis auf ein paar missglückte Übertaktungsversuche) keine Abstürze mehr.2. Die Sache mit der CPU Temperatur:Wie von vielen Quellen angegeben (und mittlerweile von AMD auch bestätigt) waren die von BIOS und von Software abgelesenen Temperaturen der CPU deutlich höher (ca. 10-20 Grad) als er wirklich hatte. Angeblich war das dafür gedacht, dass der Prozessor garantiert richtige Kühlleistung bekommt, allerdings erübrigt sich das ein bisschen für Nutzer mit Wasserkühlung, die sich dann fragen, warum der Prozessor im Ruhezustand 60-65 Grad warm wird. Nach dem letzten BIOS update von meinem ASUS Prime X370-Pro wurde dieser Wert angepasst, allerdings wird in der AMD Ryzen Master Software immer noch der erhöhte wert angezeigt (siehe Foto), also nicht erschreckt sein und panisch die Wärmeleitpaste wechseln, wenn euch am Anfang 70 Grad + angezeigt werden.Von diesen Anfangsproblemen mal abgesehen (was mich einen ganzen Tag gekostet hat) läuft der Prozessor wirklich gut.Übertakten: Mit der Ryzen Master Software leicht, auch wenn es viele lieber über BIOS machen werden. Das 1700X Modell, dessen Takt bis 3,8GHz angegeben wurde, kann auch noch gut darüber hinaus gebracht werden. Einige seiten geben an, dass Übertaktungen bis 4GHz gut möglich sind, bei wurden zwar 4GHz in der Software angezeigt, Realistisch waren es aber (im Task-Manager) ca. 3,9-3,97 GHz, was immer noch gut ist und man sich die Frage stellt, ob man die 100€ für den 1800X nicht sparen sollte. Ich muss aber sagen das bei Vollast und der Übertaktung die Temperatur trotz Corsair h60 Wasserkühlung nicht gering waren (ca. 70-80 Grad angepasst nach Temperatur Update), also eine Doppelradiator-Kühlung wird in dem bereich doch schon überlegenswertPerformance: Die Performance kann sich wirklich sehen lassen. Ich werde noch ein paar Fotos für Cinebench score und 3Dmark Firestrike Extreme Physics Test hinzufügen, aber Ryzen überzeugt deutlich bei CPU lastigen Arbeiten und kommt nah genug an Intels 6900k 8 core Prozessor ran, dass der deutlich geringere Preis (1159€!!) mehr als gerechtfertigt ist. Auch für Spiele liefert der Prozessor gute Leistungen ab. Er kann zwar generell nicht mit dem Intel i7 7700k mithalten, wenn aber Spiele multithreading besser unterstützen, ändert sich das Bild und der Ryzen 7 wird zu einer gleichwertigen Alternative. Da ich aber in Zukunft mit besseren 8 Core Support für Spiele rechne, wäre dieser Prozessor eine lohnende Investition für zukünftige Technologie.Alles in Allem bin ich nach einem etwas gestressten Installationstag doch sehr zufrieden mit AMDs neuen Produkt, besonders, weil Intel mal gezeigt wurde, dass gute Qualität nicht extrem teuer sein muss, nur weil man es teuer machen kann.', 'Der Prozessor selbst ist super und das Preisleistungsverhältnis sowieso. Er ist ausreichend in den Rezensionen beschrieben und bewertet.Was sich AMD mit der Core-Temperatur hat einfallen lassen, geht nach meiner Ansicht etwas nach hinten los.Der Plan war eine Wasserkühlung, ausgestattet mit großzügigen Radiatoren, gekoppelt über einen PWM Splitter mit dem CPU-Fan. Nun hat AMD den X-Prozessoren etwas Tolles mitgegeben: sie manipulieren an der CPU Temperatur herum. Sie verpassen ihr ein offset, damit die Lüftung nicht zu spät einsetzt. In meinem Fall sieht das so aus, dass die CPU im Idle alle paar Sekunden spontan 10° zulegt ... 36 36 34 42 41, nicht jedoch unter Last, da bleibt sie schön ruhig konstant.Zunächst dachte ich der Temp-sensor ist defekt und habe einen zweiten 1700x ausprobiert - identisch. Dann habe ich auch im Netz das Statement von AMD dazu gefunden, dass die X-Prozessoren einen Offset erhalten, um bei Übertaktungen rechtzeitig die Kühlung anzuregen.So weit so halbwegs gut gemeint, schade nur, dass die Lüftersteuerung meines MSI X370 Gaming Carbon ziemlich sensibel auf die Sprünge reagiert. Die Folge sind wilde Hochsteuerungen der Lüfter. Das eingestellte Profil wird ignoriert. Die Wasserkühlung ist groß mit vielen Lüftern. Sie sollte bei 10% laufen. Die nächste Steigung der Drehzahlsteuerung muss hinter 60°C liegen, damit sich die Steuerung im Alltag bei 40°C an das Profil anlehnt. Ansonsten springt sie ständig um 40 bis 60% der Lüfterleistung hin und  her.Dachte ich, biste clever, legst Du die Lüfter auf ein Gehäuseanschluss um und wählst die ungestörte Bordtemperatur als Indikator. Denkste, die Steuerung des MSI für Gehäuselüfter greift ebenfalls auf die CPU  Temp zu. Im BIOS-Lüfterprofilsteuerung kann man so schön einen Haken bei CPU/System machen, aber das steuert nur das Diagramm! Also wer meint, er könne sein Gehäuse beim MSI X370 anhand der Systemtemperatur kühlen lassen, leider falsch. Aber das ist natürlich Mainboard-spezifisch.Virtualisierung AMD-V wird im Bios unter OC unter CPU Features eingestellt. Brauchte ich ein Forumhinweis, um das zu finden.Kleines Update: Ich meine verstanden zu haben, wie AMD die Temperatur bewertet. Wenn CPU-Last eintrifft, d.h. ein steiler Gradient der CPU-Last entsteht, dann schickt AMD vorsorglich ein Offset an Core Temp, bevor sich die Arbeitslast tatsächlich in realer Wärme auswirkt. Das soll bewirken, dass die Kühlleistung dann bereits zur Verfügung steht. Reagiert eine gut ausgearbeitete Lüftersteuerung aber ebenfalls auf Gradienten in CPU-Last und/oder Temperaturverlauf, dann kommt es zu Verstärkung des Effekts. Denn anders lässt sich nicht erklären, dass das MSI-Board schon hochdreht, obwohl die Absolutwerte selbst noch bei 40°C liegen und die Grenze zur Drehzahlsteigerung jenseits der 50°C liegen. Wenn die CPU Arbeit hat, z.B. rendern, bleibt die Temperatur konstant.Noch eine andere, vorläufige Anmerkung: bei der Verwendung von Linux Mint 18.2 KDE erhalte ich derzeit noch ""unknown hardware"". Andere Editionen habe ich noch nicht weiter versucht. Wird vermutlich irgendwie gehen, aber noch keine Zeit zur Nachforschung gehabt.']"

Hauptanwendung ist Office/Medienwiedergabe. Als Betriebssystem verwende ich Windows 10 pro 64.Die Rechenleistung des i3-7100 liegt rund 5 % über der des Vorgängers Core i3-6100 (Skylake), was vor allem auf die höhere Taktrate von 3,9 GHz zurückzuführen ist. Wer den Vorgänger hat, für den lohnt sich ein Upgrade daher in der Regel kaum.Im CPU-Test von Cinebench R15 erreicht der i3-7100 420 Punkte. Im Grafiktest von Cinebench R15 kommt er auf 53 Punkte. Gestiegen ist gegenüber Skylake die Effizienz. Die Core-Spannung des i3-7100 liegt ""idle"" bei 0,7 Volt und steigt unter Last auf nur noch 1,09 Volt (beim i3-6100 stieg sie auf 1,18 Volt).Laut HW-Monitor verbraucht der i3-7100 unter Last nur 35 Watt - in etwa so viel wie ein Notebook-Prozessor, aber bei einem Vielfachen der Rechenleistung. Ein (für mich inzwischen verschmerzbarer) Nachteil der Kabylake-Serie ist, dass sie nicht mehr zu Windows 7 oder 8/8.1 kompatibel ist, weil Microsoft nur noch für Windows 10 Grafiktreiber bereitstellt.-------------------------------Warum ein Core i3-7100 statt des ""hochgelobten"" Intel Pentium G4560?Um Intels Pentium G4560, den sogenannten ""Preis-Leistungs-Sieger"" und ""Geheimtipp"" unter den Kabylake-Prozessoren, ist nach mehreren positiven Testberichten ein wahrer ""Hype"" entbrannt. Tatsächlich bietet auch der G4560 zwei Kerne mit Hyperthreading (frühere Pentium-CPUs von Intel hatten nur 2 Threads, also KEIN Hyperthreading). Er taktet allerdings nur mit 3,5 GHz. Der Tempounterschied zum i3-7100, der mit 3,9 GHz läuft, ist deutlich spürbar.Der größte Unterschied aber liegt in der Grafik. Während die 610-Grafik des Pentium G4560 unter Cinebench R15 nur 23 Punkte erreicht, kommt die 630-Grafik der i3-7100 auf 53 Punkte. Grund ist, dass die 630-Grafik doppelt so viele Shader hat. Die Leistung der G630-Grafik entspricht der einer aktuellen Grafikkarte im Preisbereich von 70 bis 100 Euro. Wer nur Gelegenheitsspieler ist, für den reicht die G630-Grafik vollkommen aus. Bei der 610-Grafik könnte es eher ""eng"" werden.Der Pentium G4560 bestach anfangs durch einen sehr günstigen Preis von 55 Euro. Inzwischen werden aber, offenbar infolge obigen ""Hypes"", teils 80 Euro und mehr für ihn verlangt.  Das sind nur 20 Euro weniger als der aktuelle Preis für den i3-7100. In Anbetracht der Mehrleistung - speziell in der Grafik - ist der i3-7100 meiner Meinung nach inzwischen attraktiver. Vor allem, wenn man die 20 Euro Aufpreis in Relation setzt zu dem Gesamtpreis eines Eigenbau-PCs, der in der Regel bei über 300 Euro liegt.-------------------------------Warum ein Core i3-7100 statt einer neuen AMD Ryzen-CPU?AMD hat mit der Ryzen-Serie den PC-Markt ""aufgemischt"" und Intel unter Druck gesetzt. So gibt es z. B. seit einigen Wochen Ryzen R3-CPUs, die wie der i3-7100 nur rund 100 Euro kosten, dafür aber vier echte Kerne haben, frei übertaktbar sind und bis auf 3800 MHz oder gar 4000 MHz gebracht werden können. Sind die nicht attraktiver als ein i3-7100? Meine Anwort: Nein. Begründung:1. Die Rechenleistung des kleinsten Ryzen R3 1200 entspricht laut Tests nur knapp der des Intel Pentium G4560 (siehe oben). Er ist damit leistungsschwächer als der i3-7100. Ob das auch (noch) bei Übertaktung gilt, kann ich mangels Erfahrung nicht beantworten.2. Ryzen-CPUs haben keine eingebaute Grafik. Ich hätte zusätzlich eine Grafikkarte kaufen müssen. Wenn ich eine wollte, die der Grafikleistung des i3-7100 entspricht, hätte ich mindestens weitere 70 Euro ausgeben müssen.3. Ryzen-CPUs haben noch immer eine schlechtere Energieeffizienz als Intel-CPUs. Ryzen ist zwar ein deutlicher Schritt nach vorn (gegenüber Steamroller und Co.) Doch gleichauf liegt AMD noch immer nicht. Aktuelle Ryzen-Rechner konsumieren schon im ""Leerlauf"" laut Tests rund 45 Watt, während der i3-7100 mit meinem B250M-C-Mainboard ""idle"" lediglich 25 Watt verbraucht. Bei Höchstlast zieht der i3-7100 inkl. Board/Speicher/SSD nur 62 Watt.-------------------------------Warum jetzt noch eine Kabylake-CPU, wo doch gerade Intels neue Coffeelake-Serie rausgekommen ist? (UPDATE 8.10.17)Mit dem Core i3-8100 (Coffeelake) bietet Intel seit Anfang Oktober - erstmals innerhalb der i3-Serie - einen echten Vierkerner (ohne Hyperthreading) an. Bislang waren die Core i3-CPUs stets Zweikerner mit Hyperthreading. Das ergibt zwar in beiden Fällen vier Threads, aber mit vier echten Kernen entsteht ""mehr Dampf"". Auch erfordern immer mehr Spiele das Vorhandensein von vier physischen Kernen. Der Core i3-8100 wird allerdings nur mit 3,6 GHz getaktet.Mitte September, als ich den i3-7100 kaufte, hieß es noch, dass der i3-8100 erst Anfang 2018 rauskommen soll. Intel hat den Launch jedoch vorgezogen - offenbar in Reaktion auf die Verkaufserfolge von AMD Ryzen. D.h. der i3-8100 ist bereits jetzt (8.10.17) im Handel mit Lieferzeit bestellbar. Der Preis liegt rund 20 Euro über dem des i3-7100. Speziell für Gamer dürfte sich dieser Aufpreis lohnen, weil der i3-8100 nach aktuellen Tests (Anandtech) ähnlich schnell sein soll wie die Einstiegsversionen der Core i5-CPUs der Kabylake-Serie. Wenn ich von dem vorgezogenen Launch gewusst hätte, dann hätte ich wohl noch gewartet.Ein Nachteil von Coffeelake ist, dass man auch ein neues Mainboard der 300-Serie benötigt (zurzeit nur als Z370 erhältlich und relativ teurer). Grund: Die Coffeelake-Prozessoren verwenden zwar den gleichen Sockel 1151, haben aber eine andere Pin-Belegung. Außerdem sind sie nicht kompatibel zu Intels bisherigen 200- und 100-Chipsätzen. Der ""neue"" Sockel heißt wegen der unterschiedlichen Pin-Belegung auch 1151-v2. (Dass Coffeelake-CPUs trotzdem auch physisch in ältere 1151-Sockel passen - inkl. Aussparungen [""notches""] -, hält Anandtech-Rezensent Ian Cutress als fahrlässig, da elektrische Beschädigungen von CPU und/oder Mainboard drohen. Um schnell auf AMD reagieren zu können, scheint Intel etwas überhastet vorzugehen.)Ein Grund mehr, sich von dieser Hast nicht anstecken zu lassen. Kabylake-CPUs sind jedenfalls voll abwärtskompatibel zu den 100-Chipsätzen und können daher nach BIOS-Update auch in älteren Skylake-Mainboards verwendet werden. Vorteil: Die bestehende Windows-10-Registrierung für das Skylake-Mainboard bleibt erhalten.Wenn Sie diese Rezension hilfreich fanden, freue ich mich über eine entsprechende Bewertung.', 'CPU i3-7100 @ 3.9GHz monté sur une ASUS H110I-PlusPositifs:Performances excellentes pour des usages de bureautique et navigation Internet.

For those that don't know many games even today really only use 1 core at a time. This puppy is extremely low wattage to begin with (lower wattage= less heat generated) and hopefully longer system life. This i3's single core performance is up there with $350+ xeons and i7's. So for the price it's very impressive as long as your games can only use 1 or 2 cores at a time. For a bit of education if you do ctrl+alt+delete and it looks like a game or process is using all cores equally it is usually a lie. It is in reality one core getting hammered at 100% then jumping to the next one in the series. You have to actually research to figure out how many cores your game actually uses at one time. If you aren't a gamer and for some reason are building a desktop for casual internet use like watching youtube videos and browsing the internet an i3 like this is probably the best thing for you to buy.

The fact is the unless you are a heavy gamer, developer, or render videos and pictures on a daily basis, you most likely will not even be utalising more than two cores anyway.

Affidabile e una garanzia', ""Ho acquistato questo processore I5-6600 boxato a ottobre 2015, dopo 4 mesi mi sento di poter dare un giudizio completo.Troverete migliaia di recensioni su internet a riguardo, vorrei sottolineare 2 aspetti che però spesso vengono trascurati da recensori professionisti: dissipatore stock ed efficienza energetica in idle. Legati l'uno all'altro.Il nuovo processo produttivo a 14 nm consente nuovi traguardi di efficienza energetica, questo processore ed ovviamente tutta la famiglia skylake in idle consuma 2 o al massimo 3 watt. Sotto un utilizzo leggero (navigazione web, film, download) il carico rimane a non più di  5-7 watt.Un carico energetico così basso può essere gestito dal dissipatore stock senza alcun problema, 2 watt possono essere dissipati con successo anche a ventola completamente ferma se ci pensate (quello che avviene in un tablet o smartphone ad esempio).Il dissipatore stock ha una ventola PWM che con adeguata scheda madre (asus con Fan Xpert 3) può essere comandata da 400 rpm a 3000 rpm.Fino a 7-800 rpm la ventola è inudibile, a 1200 rpm incomincia a farsi sentire appena, sopra i 1600 rpm il rumore diventa fastidioso.In pratica fino a 15-20w (30% di carico CPU) di consumo si può far lavorare la ventola stock a livelli non udibili sotto i 1200 rpm.Per superare i 15 watt con questa CPU bisogna giocare o fare editing video o calcolo pesante.Se si gioca con le cuffie vedrete che il rumore del dissipatore stock non si sente nemmeno a 2000 rpm.Il consiglio che vorrei dare a tutti quelli che compreranno questa CPU è valutare l'utilizzo che se ne fa e di tenere il dissipatore stock almeno i primi tempi.Se non si lavora costantemente con la CPU a più del 30% del carico potrebbe non servire un dissipatore aftermarket.In questo momento sto navigando, riproducendo un film HD sul secondo monitor e ho avviato una sessione di download pesante.Siamo a 6-7 watt di consumo, CPU a 35 gradi con dissipatore stock a 700 rpm e ventole del case completamente ferme.Abbinate un alimentatore con ventola ferma a basso carico e un ssd e avrete un pc non udibile.Due parole sul video integrato, è abbastanza potente da far girare i giochi più recenti in full hd con dettagli base, a risoluzioni più basse si arriva a dettagli  medio bassi."", ""Inizio la recensione col dire che stavolta la spedizione è stata più lunga del previsto, perchè amazon aveva il prodotto in francia ed ha dovuto viaggiare...trovato il processore al secondo giorno dalla pubblicazione su amazon a 217 euro con spedizione gratuita (il 4690 costava 230) e l' ho comprato inmediatamente...Il montaggio del processore nel suo socket 1151 è veramente facile e veloce, non dovreste avere problemi (ero al mio primo pc da montare), l' unico grattacapi ve lo da il dissipatore.Che dire delle prestazioni, se comprate un processore professionale, potete pagarlo anche 2000 di euro, ma la velocità del sistema rimane più o meno quella (dipende dall hdd, o ss ((quasi obbligatorio se si monta un pc di questo livello).Però posso fare un grandissimo plauso alla sua hd 530 che monta, ha davvero prestazioni sbalorditive per essere una integrata.In questo momento aspetto l arrivo della r9 390,E a mia grandissima sorpresa, riesco a fare 35 fps su rust experimental in hd con dettagli alti/massimi.... e mantengo temperature veramente basse abbinato al rajintek themis,Usando la sua pasta termica, che di solito fanno schifo (compratene una a parte cbe guadagnate qualcosa in termini di temperature) e ho in idle 20 gradi su tutti i core, cioè era più calda la mobo e il case che la cpu...Il carico della cpu non arriva mai al 100%, nemmeno se ci provate...tranquilli che giocando vi dura almeno 5 anni senza colli di bottiglia.Tenete conto che dovete prendere una mobo e delle ram ddr4 apposite, quindi se partite col farvi un nuovo pc ne vale la pena, altrimenti se venite dalla scorsa generazione di cpu lasciate stare...Spero di esservi stato utile pcI5 6600H170 asrock pro4sR9 390 8gbCorsair vengeance lpx"", ""L'acquisto di questa CPU è stato dettato dall'esigenza di costruire un PC da gaming per un mio parente senza sforare cifre esagerate. Sebbene esistessero i5 dalle frequenze anche più basse la scelta è stata orientata su questo perché aveva prestazioni non troppo dissimili dagli i7 base della stessa famiglia.PRO:- Elevate prestazioni e frequenze adeguate a sessioni di gioco intense- Framerate elevati con CPU affiancata da scheda grafica Geforce 1060 e 8GB DDR4 di ram per il sistema, anche con i giochi di ultima generazione. Nessun calo di framerate e giocabilità al massimo. Quasi inutile spendere di più per schede video più potenti e prestanti. Il guadagno si aggirerebbe intorno ai 20fps quando con questa cpu e scheda video siamo ben oltre la giocabilità e la fluidità- Pochissimo calore nonostante le elevate prestazioni, è difficile sentire la ventola al massimo anche nelle sessioni di gioco più intense.CONTRO:- Non è economico ma di certo il prezzo è allineato alle prestazioni offerte- Non ha il moltiplicatore sbloccato verso l'alto per l'overclock, tuttavia con alcune schede madri è possibile comunque elevarne le frequenze.- La ventola non è grandissima e la pasta termica non era adeguatamente protetta ma anzi esposta alla polvere. Questo mi fa pensare che fra un anno andrà cambiata perché sarà già secca e forse l'uso di un dissipatore più grande consentirebbe di avere maggior margine di temperature andando a evitare qualsiasi danno. Consiglio di cambiarla al momento  del montaggio."", 'Bei der Bestellung dieser CPU ist mit etwas sehr merkwürdiges passiert. Als ich den Karton der CPU in der Hand gehalten habe, dachte ich, da stimmt was nicht. Es hatte weniger Gewicht als erwartet, und die Öffnung, wo normalerweise die CPU geschützt durch Kunststoff durch das Gehäuse scheint, war zugeklebt. Nach dem entfernen der Folie und öffnen des Kartons der Schock:Es war eine defekte, bewusst durchgebrochene Grafikkarte im Karton, ummantelt von zwei Stücken Styropor. Das war und ist natürlich mehr als merkwürdig. Gekauft habe ich dir CPU direkt bei Amazon. Ich weiß bis heute nicht, wie sowas passieren kann, aber es ist passiert.Natürlich hatte ich erstmal Angst, dass sich der Umtausch problematisch gestaltet. Die Angst war aber unbegründet. Amazon hat sofort reagiert und eine neue CPU verschickt und mit Zeit gegeben, die alte ""CPU"" zurück zu senden. Alle Achtung, das hätte ich bei derart teurer Hardware nicht gedacht. Hier ein fettes Lob an Amazon!Zur CPU, der Einbau gestaltet sich einfach. Das aufbringen des Boxed Kühlers kann einen schonmal etwas wütend und ungeduldig machen, allerdings muss man hier natürlich aufpassen. Einbau des Kühlers IMMER bei ausgebautem Mainboard, um keine unnötige Spannung auf das Mainboard zu bringen und dadurch zu beschädigen.Die CPU ist angenehm Flott, zum zocken einem gehobenen Mittelklasse PC\'s absolut ausreichend. In Kombination mit einer GTX 1060 ist hier sehr viel Potential. Leider kann ich keine genauen Angaben zu den FPS machen, da ich den PC für meinen Bruder zusammengestellt habe.Sie stellt aber durchaus eine Konkurrenz zu meiner nicht-übertakteten 3570k dar und ist dabei noch energieeffizienter. Alltagsaufgaben werden rasch abgearbeitet. Wer kein Highend will, kann hier zuschlagen!', 'Der Einbau eines nicht ganz preiswerten Prozessor ist mit vielen Überlegungen verbunden. Muss das Mainboard ausgebaut sein, ist Wärmeleitpaste dabei, wie trägt man sie auf, reicht der CPU- Kühler, WIN10 neu freischalten usw. ???Da ein altes Mainboard und dessen AMD Prozessor einfach nicht mehr mithalten konnten, sollte es ein neues Mainboard mit modernem Prozessor sein. Auf der SSD war im alten System schon WIN 10 upgegradet.Das Mainboard und der Einbau der CPU war wirklich einfach- ein Video im Vorfeld für den Neuling ist aber hilfreich. Der Einbau des beigelegten CPU Kühlers- nur einklicken und fertig. Hier war schon Wärmeleitpaste aufgetragen (meine größte Besorgnis da etwas falsch zu machen). Das Mainboard muss für den Einbau der CPU und des Kühlers nicht ausgebaut werden. Der restliche Einbau auf einem Asus Board war eher ""Komplizierter""- Ursache aber Mainboard Hersteller! SSD angeschlossen und Computer gestartet. Zum Glück funktionierte WIN10 ohne Neuanmeldung bei Microsoft. WIN 10 bietet die Möglichkeit das System neu aufzusetzen- ein Programmpunkt unter Einstellungen-->Wiederherstellen und dann PC Zurücksetzen. Empfehle ich trotzdem- auch wenn alle Komponenten ohne Probleme erkannt wurden.Die Entscheidung für den 6600 hatte finanzielle Überlegungen. Ein Asus Mainbaord- H110Plus und ein 8GB DDR4 2400 MHz RAM.Dem Gegenüber steht natürlich der 6600k (der hier auch im Haushalt taktet)- hier benötigt man zusätzlich zum übertaktfähigem Mainboard noch ein CPU Lüfter. Preisunterschied der Komponenten ca.100€  Wer einen neuen Kühler und ein besseres Mainboard einsetzt, der sollte auch gleich zum 6600k greifen. Hier sind 4,2 GHz ohne Probleme möglich.Das System läuft stabil (aktuell ist der Prozessor nicht über 35°C gestiegen) und ist für die meisten Anwendungen vollkommen ausreichend.', ""Acquistato per una configurazione medio alta, insieme ad una Gtx 970, si comporta bene, scalda poco e garantisce delle buone prestazioni, provato con tutti i giochi Blizzard, si comporta benissimo.Ci tengo a raccontare però ciò che mi è accaduto a distanza di 4 mesi. Spero che non si ripresenti un problema del genere, ho letto e sentito dire che succede veramente di raro, ma dopo 4 mesi dall'acquisto un giorno il processore ha deciso di smettere di funzionare, il pc partiva, ma non arrivavano segnali alle periferiche in output, ho contattato Amazon via numero verde, e hanno subito provveduto (nonostante fossero passati più di 30 giorni) a mandare a casa un corriere a ritirare la CPU difettosa, e nel giro di 2 giorni a spedirne una nuova, che funziona. Sono rimasto davvero esterrefatto dalla qualità del servizio, dubito che un qualsiasi altro venditore avrebbe potuto garantire una tale rapidità di risoluzione del problema.A parte lo spiacevole evento, per ora lascio 4 stelle perchè il processore soddisfa a pieno le mie esigenze."", ""Un gammer ha bisogno di un processore all'altezza;ma tutto sommato l'annoso dilemma tra 7 e 5 risulta essere veramente insignificate se si ha a disposizione una scheda video adeguata e ram quanto basta.Non voglio  dilungarmi in discorsi tecnologici o grafici,scrivo questa recensione a distanza di mesi dal suo acquisto e se dovessi ricomprarlo lo rifarei.Non è owerloccabile ma sicuramente stabile,sicuro e affidabile. Lo si vede nel tempo nelle risposte non del gioco ma nell'uso quotidiano,non tradisce,abbinato ad una scheda Asus z170 o anche h170 diventa un matrimonio perfetto.Temperature basse esercizio di alimentazione minimo e resa ottimale, sempre al meglio.Ho letto molte recensioni tecniche o meno,ma nell'uso si vede almeno come utenza finale,se un prodotto è valido e questo è un processore che può competere tranquillamente anche con con la stessa famigli I7 o AMD.Sockett 1151 almeno nel mio caso a meno che non si faccia grafica vettoriale professionale ritengo il giusto compromesso tra potenza e affidabilità."", ""Subito i pro e i cons.Pro:Buona potenzaBasso consumoNon scaldaQualità IntelContro:Mi aspettavo qualcosa in piùHo comprato questo processore in sostituzione ad un i5 3570k che aveva un overclock a 4.8ghz (dopo anni ha ceduto) non mi aspettavo di avere la stessa potenza essendo non K ma rispetto alle frequenze stock non ci è stato questo salto prestazionale. Tornassi indietro spendere qualcosa in più per l' i7 6700 versione non K.Perché prendere la versione non K?Se volete un processore potente, (per giocare o per lavoro) ma soprattutto molto affidabile. A frequenze standard probabilmente lo cambierete quando il processore sarà troppo vecchio per le prestazioni.Ho abbinato questo processore con il dissipatore che mi trovavo dal vecchio processore versione overclock.Temperatura idle 28° (in estate) max 48° Full(Con queste temperature non si romperà mai)Per il gioco consiglio lo stesso un dissipatore leggermente più grande.

If you encounter the same problem, see this-https://communities.intel.com/thread/28044?tstart=0The price should be around 15k but it is a lot more expensive, maybe because of VAT.

DO NOT! WITHOUT DOING SERIOUS RESEARCHMy review is directed towards gamers since you can run MS Word on a potato and if you do video production, the Core i-7 is the sweet spot.Now breathe, relax your mind, and manage the excitement you have garnered from the prospect of not having to pay to play online with friends (ahem! plus-live-gold), SAVE UP an extra $100 - 150 and buy this processor. I bought the AMD X4 860k, then bought the Core i-3, and finally this i-5 in a 2 week period (returned the others).Why? Because this is a much more superior CPU. It is faster, has 4 cores and a frequency of 3.20 GHZ. Also, it has integrated graphics (which is a plus weather gamers acknowledge it or not). If you want an unlocked sucker, get the \'K\' version for an extra $20. I bought this because I exceeded my budget by about 30% (tee-hee). You are getting every dollar out of it. Not saying you are not getting a bang for your buck from the other processors mentioned, but after hours and hours of research, it only made sense to ""Eat the extra cost"" since I\'ll be doing content creation (I know, but the Core i-7 bleh-bleh-bleh). If you are in doubt, I recommend these YouTube reviewers to give detailed explanations of the or-15 6500A special thanks to the YouTube Channels, Science Review, Digital Foundry, Hardware Unboxed, Austin Evans, JayZsTwoCents.These Tech reviewers are professional and carry out extensive research and benchmarks for a wide variety of games. In fact, \'Hardware Unboxed\' is my favorite because they run benchmarks for at least 12 - 20 different games! Crazy huh?My thoughts:The year 2016 is winding down and newer titles will eventually show up: you do not want to regret not utilizing every aspect of your PC to enjoy the experience. A good example is the Division which is about to bring its player base up and release content all the way into 2017. even though you can use a NOT-Core-i5 processor to run it, the game\'s minimum requirement is a Core i-5 2400, which is also a very good CPU as well. Its even cheaper than this (you will save about $50 or more if you don\'t want to spend on this)Here\'s my build for you to weigh the cost (PS I wasn\'t going for Shinny PC, but a powerhouse):Rosewell Micro-ATX Case with 400W Power Supply: Initially $38 from Amazon;s warehouse deals. Got an extra 15% discount because it didn\'t come with screws, hence $33 Also 400W can power most GPU\'s but my GPU required 500W, so i bought another PSU :(CPU:  Core i5 6500 3.2 ghz: $203 - Ouch! To the wallet, but worth every single dollar. (If it goes on sale at a lower price, I still won\'t be mad)RAM:  Ballistix Sport LT 8GB Single DDR4  - $42.99MOBO: Gigabyte LGA1151 Intel H110 Micro ATX DDR4 Motherboard GA-H110M-A - $49.99GPU:  MSI GAMING RX 480 GDDR5  4GB (it was the same price as an RX 470, so why not) - $199.99PSU:  EVGA 500 W1, 80+ WHITE 500W, - $35.99Time:  At lest 4-6 HoursMiscallaneous:  $45All part prices are from Amazon.com at the time of this review.My Hard Drive\'s were from my old computers and my monitor was also from an old PC as well. You have to understand, this is still under $700 if you add the cost of a monitor mouse and keyboard. It\'s twice the price of a recent console, but it will perform better. Plus, it is open ended (or ""future proof"" - don\'t lie the term). I can upgrade my GPU when the next Gen of consoles are released. And if I become a millionaire before then, I can upgrade to the Skylake\'s Core i-7 Even then, PC ports will be optimized for the masses!CONCLUSIONYou, as the potential buyer have to weigh the cost, but from my research, this is one of the better gaming PCs you can rig up right now. In fact, a pre-built PC with these components was selling for about $800 a few months ago.So, if you are looking for a budget gaming Rig, ensure you have a strong CPU and GPU. Prices fluctuate, so keep an eye out to get the best value for your money.', 'IMBALLAGGIOCome potrete ben vedere dalle immagini il prodotto arriva in una scatola piccola e nel complesso leggera. Nella parte frontale troveremo il logo Intel in alto a destra, il nome del prodotto, ovvero ""Intel core i5"" grande al centro, e sotto il nome specifico del modello, e qui parliamo di un i5-6500 con una sigla sotto (LGA1151) a cui dovrete stare molto attenti perché da quella sigla capirete la sua compatibilità con la scheda madre ed altri componenti: occhi aperti se vi state facendo la vostra configurazione come nel mio caso (io ho comprato una scheda madre Asus H170-PRO). All\' interno invece troverete la vostra cpu con le classiche coperture del socket!DESCRIZIONE GENERALELa cpu si presenta con il suo classico colore grigio, facile da inserire nella scheda madre, non mi ha dato nessun problema. Purtroppo, dato il fatto che non ho montato io il mio computer non vi so dare consigli sulla pasta termica. Sopra ci ho montato un dissipatore cooler master abbastanza economico, invece del classico dissipatore Intel che offre il prodotto (andrebbe comunque bene per chi non ha bisogno di dissipare tanta aria e quindi chi non richiede molto sforzo da parte del pc ma queste non sono le mie caratteristiche), e va tutto alla grande! Sono passati ormai due anni da quando ho acquistato il prodotto e posso dire che va ancora tutto come se fosse il suo primo giorno!CONCLUSIONIQuesto prodotto lo consiglio veramente a chiunque, anche se col tempo probabilmente usciranno prodotti che non avranno nulla a che vedere con questo prodotto in confronto a qualità/prezzo... ma data la facile manovrabilità, la sua affidabilita e il suo prezzo molto accessibile, lo ritengo davvero un prodotto eccellente.P.S. Se avete domande un esitate a chiedere, risponderò il prima possibile! (Ho messo una sola foto perche ormai è stato inserito nel pc perciò l\'unica cosa che vi posso far vedere è la scatola smantellata dopo l\'injserimento! Le foto di Amazon vi saranno comunque d\'aiuto!)', ""E' un ottimo processore se non avete necessità di fare overclock.  Alla fine ho preso il 6600K che lo permette per dare più longevità al sistema con una spesa poco maggiore."", ""As someone upgrading from a Core 2 Duo E7200, this chip is amazing. I'll let the thousand other reviews go into the technical details of the processor, but I want to specifically mention the cooling.I bought this for a brand new build, and with it I also purchased an aftermarket Cooler Master Geminii to ensure that temps stayed low. I'd heard from other reviews that some didn't even receive the stock cooler (which is ridiculous, it's 98% of whats taking up space in the box) or a few that said the stock thermal compound (pre-applied on the heatsink) was pathetic and worth the Arctic Silver upgrade. However, when I purchased this though Amazon (NOT a reseller) I got a factory sealed box with the stock cooler, and it actually works AMAZINGLY.After some stress testing, installing, and heavy game playing, I am happy to report that the highest temps I've seen so far are about 47c. At idle, I get about 25c. And mind you, I monitored this during a 2 hr game installation and a 1080p game workload. I am honestly blown away by the effectiveness of the stock cooler. Of course it wouldn't work for any decent overclocking, but for the 6500, there's no need at all for an aftermarket cooler.UPDATE - 6/6/2017Been using the CPU for mostly gaming, some AutoCad and other editing here and there, and the whole stock air setup is still working magnificently. A little note on my setup: i5 6500, Gtx 1060 6gb, 1TB Samsung EVO SSD, 16gb Ballistix RAM, and 6 Corsair AF120 fans. This CPU has not let me down once. Even under full load during stress testing for almost 20 minutes, the highest temperate recorded was 56 degrees. With a stock cooler. Wow. Knowing this though, I kind of want a K edition card now that I see the enormous overclocking headroom. So maybe I should've spend the extra $40... But no complaints, this particular unit will continue working like a beast for years to come."", ""The title says most of it. It's a good chip if you're not running anything super demanding like content development. It will do it reliably, but it's a bit slow. Probably good for teaching kids patience. It's getting outdated though, because it doesn't run AVX instructions... in lamens if you try to play Cyberpunk 2077 with it, it will crash your video drivers. It's likely AVX instructions will be used in software more and more so this chip might be useless in a few years.... assuming loads of programmers have shifty coding practices like CD Project Red. Many programs have workarounds, so there is hope for this chip yet.Badly optimized games aside, it will play most games flawlesy. I played portal without a GPU and it was brilliant. Paired with the good old NVidia GTX1080 I play Mortal Kombat 10/11 with the graphics maxed out no problem.

Amazon however have always been good for me, and their parcel arrived when it was meant to, along with another company who delivered my motherboard.

I repaired some laptops with the AMD C series processor, but that is far away from this. Even when I compare the graphics perfomance from my (unaffortunally gifted) Lenovo laptop with Intel HD Graphics 3000... WOOOOAAA!! This APU is a beast!Ok, this can\'t be compared with any Quad-Core processor from Intel or even AMD. Any Quad-Core with a great graphics card can destroy this little bunny. But what about the dual cores?... Well, personally I can\'t test it side-by-side with the Pentium G3258 yet (the ""Anniversary"" edition CPU from Intel) but for graphics the AMD can be more powerful (maybe not a lot). Both are overclockable so, you can add ""more fun"" to both, but I\'m still thinking the APU can be better, just for graphics. Both can cost the same (Aprox. 60-70$) so both can be a bang for the buck for their respective platforms, but maybe in the Intel side you can get more benefits if you plan to get an i7 like the 4790K later on... Spending 300$ but building a powerful Z97 machine... Perfect! (That was my second option, but I just have 300$ to spend in the whole year... I can\'t upgrade for that i7 until the next year thanks to the Exchange control in my country Venezuela).But for a 300$ upgrade (or build, read my GA-F2A88X-UP4 review for details), this APU is just playing it so well. I didn\'t expect that kind of performance in games I never hope to run in this.Assassin\'s Creed Brotherhood in med-high at 1080p. GRID 2 and F1 2013 at 1080p in medium details. Low details at 720p in NFS Rivals (still playable, over 25FPS). Maxed out The Sims 4 at 1080p without antialising with variable 35 to 60fps. WOOOOOW!! I an happy (noob) gamer today. Thanks for this APU, AMD... But if I just could afford any quad core APU like the 7850K :\'(.Let\'s talk about bad things from this little bunny. This APU is the worst (ok, the less featured) from the Kaveri architecture. It just have two cores running at 3.5GHz, with a little boost to 3.9GHz. That boost can do weird things in the temperature, I have this APU with the included cooler for about two months and today I had to change the thermal compound because my temps are taking above 70ºC; I do not recommend get this APU above 70º, this its thermal limit, and can short the lifespan.Hold on a second. Why are this APU taking the temps too far? Are you doing some overclocking?My answer YES... And no.Because if you motherboard have the ""Turbo"" feature for the APU clock already activated, you APU is doing some overclocking secretly... Until you check with some software like AIDA64 in the Overclock section: 13% of ""secretly"" overclocking. Not a huge deal if you don\'t play recent games like NFS Rivals. In my experience, the processor does it quite well running the gaming until my case sensors alert when the temps go to high (70-75ºC). Maybe I look like a maniac with the temps, but is a serious business: If you get some thermal throttling, you can notice it looking the performance; in my case, NFS goes with some lag when the temps gets above 70º at 720p resolution. That\'s not good and must to be solved.You can\'t do great thing with the supplied CPU cooler. Maybe some thermal compound change, helps. But the great secret if you want to continue with the stock cooler is deactivate the ""Turbo"" feature in the motherboard UEFI. The games right now runs solid, and not to far from 50ºC. Nice.If you want to get this issue completely rid off (Ok, my english isn\'t perfect, but you can get the point), buy an aftermarket CPU cooler like a Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo or whatever you like. Those coolers can provide you some improvements in the temps ""problems"", like 5 to 15ºC less, in some cases. Consider the airflow in your case and your, that helps too.Well, this is a good performer. Not a CPU destroyer, but this can run flawlessly in you FM2+ system (remember, this one can\'t run in a FM2 motherboard, just in FM2+ boards). I recommend get this thing feed with some fast RAM like 1866, 2133 or even 2400MHz DDR3 RAM; that can help you to get some improvements in graphical tasks because the GPU cores in the APU need system memory to get a boost in performance. Its a nice upgrade or a very good plan if you are taking options for a new build. For me, is a great experience.', 'Very nippy little processor, especially in the light of my old Intel E6300 Core Duo, but perhaps that is not really a fair comparison!Onboard GPU also a nice bonus, no extra cards getting in the way, or noisy graphics fans.Frankly, the performance is quite remarkable at this price point.I set this up on an Asus A88X-PRO motherboard with 8GB of Hyper X Beast memory rated at 2400MHz, but dropped down to 1866MHz to match the processor. (See reviews elsewhere)Apart from the memory speed alteration, the motherboard was set to ""Auto"" with no deliberate overclocking, and despite the processor rating of 3.5GHZ standard, 3.9GHz Turbo, it ran at 4.1GHz ""out of the box"" (still does), and has never exceeded a temperature of 41C on the standard fan, with no evidence of stress or instability.Like some others, I bought this as a budget processor, with thoughts of perhaps upgrading it later (hence the motherboard and memory choice), but on the basis of this performance I shall probably be keeping it for a while yet and have a play with some of the motherboard overclocking settings.Unless you are into some seriously heavy gaming, number crunching, CAD or video editing, you will not be disappointed.Buy one! Almost forgot-(doing this a lot lately-must be an age thing). In my case the GPU initially showed as a ""Standard VGA Adapter"" and some programmes reported ""Hardware Acceleration not Enabled"". To overcome this I went on to the AMD site and downloaded the latest graphics drivers(Catalyst suite).It will ask you whether you have a GPU or APU and ask you to put in the model number-it\'s all very straightforward. It will then direct you to the appropriate version to download.This solved my problems, and the screen image certainly also seems a little crisper.', ""This processor was bought with the intent of it being replaced with an upgrade fairly soon. I paired it with an MSI A88xm motherboard and 8GB Adata  1866mhz ram.  It runs so well  that anupgrade will probably wait.  The stock cooling fan is very quiet and keeps the chip very cool to the point that only a few times has a case fan been called upon for additional cooling by the motherboard. When I have monitored the APU it has usually been in the low 50s celsius (way below any danger zone). It plays all the games my son and I are interested in at very playable frame rates which I owe to using the max speed ram the apu recommends.  It plays Minecraft , Skyrim , Just Cause2, Portal2, Arma2 and many others very well. Is it a gaming screamer? No, but like I say it plays all these games at decent resolutions very well.  It is only a dual core, but most games in particular at the moment use only 1 or 2 cores anyway, If you always have large numbers of windows open with active content on all of them then a 4 or more core processor would probably run more smoothly, but we don't run anything in the background that might detract from performance. This was why I used this as an entry level APU as the 2 processing core it contains are more than adequate to replace an aging system and perform what we currently ask of it. I have not attempted overclocking it as of yet, but might  at some point. It hasn't been necessary to play with that at the moment.  My only bit of advice is upon system set-up  make sure to go to AMD and update the drivers (we went from potentially disappointed performance to overwhelmingly happy).

I bought this CPU intended for office use, so I think this A6 chip might even be overkill for such job. This APU also comes with integrated R5 graphics, so no extra discrete graphic card is needed.For gaming though, steer away and go for other CPU, such as Intel Core or AMD's new Ryzen series.However, the stock cooler is awful. The temperature runs very high at 70C even at idle. I do have an extra older stock cooler from the old Phenom chips, and the heatsink is way better, dropping the temperature at 40C idle. Do consider on buying a cheap cooler and good thermal paste to replace the stock cooler to keep running this CPU cool.Overall, I recommend this product for building a computer for general use and office, as it has integrated graphics and parts that are cheaper than some of Intel's variants."", 'El procesador se usa para tareas básicas como navegar por internet y funciona sin problemas incluso se pueden jugar juegos como LoL o algo similar, el único problema es la temperatura,  con el disipador de stock funcionaba a 75+ llegando a los 85 o más con el turbo, para mantenerlo debajo de los 72° que especifica la compañía que no debería de pasar compre un cooler más grande de amd ya que un un 212evo no cabe el el gabinete de la pc donde esta instalado ya que es slim, aun y con ese cooler no es suficiente y tengo que desactivar el boost para que no pase los 70°, fuera de la temperatura funciona sin problemas.', ""All in all a cheap cpu and graphics solutin for budget builds, I'd seen some claims of people playing things like GTA V on these and I've got to say I doubt them after trying this APU for myself, I used this for a budget build for my sister who doesn't play anything too demanding, but even basic multitasking maxes out the processor.I tested it quite thoroughly, done a few stress tests to make sure everything was stable and it simply seems the processor isn't up to doing much but run very low end 3D graphics and only using one program at a time other it slows right down.I've tested Bioshock, Portal 2 and The Sims 3 and they run atleast at 30fps, Life is Strange has some very low FPS I'd consider it unplayable (i'd imagine it'd be down to poor optimisation).All in all the build was incredibly cheap under £170 in total so I wasn't expecting much from it."", ""Good CPU for use on your second computer.

I discovered that it was because the computer was placed in area with very little airflow, and must have been damaged by overheating. I installed a better heat sink (originally just used the stock heat sink) and it seems to have improved significantly, though it looks like the processor is now permanently damaged. It isn't returning many driver errors anymore, and isn't overheating anymore. Just a word of caution from someone who should have known better than to trust a stock heat sink and fan.

I needed something future proof to make sure it doesn\'t bottleneck any GPU I place in there. tested it with a GTX 770 which is equivalent to the GTX 680. ran benchmarks on 1080p and got almost the same results I got from i5 4670k (no overclocking in both tests). no need to OC nor try to exceed the capabilities of this CPU. I was planning to get an i5 4670k + after market cooler + Z87 mobo. then I researched some benchmarks and realised there is no need to go for an expensive CPU while the graphics are all in the GPU. so I skipped the cooler, downgraded to this CPU and downgraded the mobo choise to B85. this saved my $ 80 which was invested in upgrading the GPU and thus achiving an excellent performance.if you plan to play games on a single monitor at 1080 res or even at 1440 res then you\'re looking for a GPU of the GTX 760 tier or HD 7870 XT or even the higher tier such as GTX 770 or HD 7970 then this CPU is the right choice for you. however, if you plan to go even higher or to SLI, then I guess you\'d be better off with an i5 4670k (or i7 depending on your target res+FPS and required GPU setup for the job) + Z87 board + after market cooler in that case. hence that overclocking will require you to buy a higher watt PSU which might add up more bucks to the budget. I\'m using 550W for this build which is considered overkill considering I\'m not overclocking or using GPU in SLI/CF.The only con that cost the last star is the price point. although this cpu is great, I find it more feasible to buy an ivy bridge higher end cpu from microcenter at the same/lower price. idk what intel is thinking with their price ranges. you\'ll also save up on mobo as the Z77 prices are decreasing in the presence of the newer Z87 generation. it\'s true that you\'ll lose the 10% performance advantage of haswell but you\'ll have overcloking capabilities which is even more future proof for gaming rigs.The setup:CPU: Intel Core i5-4570Motherboard: MSI B85-G41 PC Mate ATX LGA1150Memory: Corsair Vengeance 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 CL9 1.5vSSD: Samsung 840 120GB SATA 6b/sHDD: Western Digital Caviar Black 750GB 3.5"" 7200RPM SATA 6b/sGPU: EVGA GTX 760 2GB ACX Cooler SupercloskedCase: NZXT Tempest 410PSU: SeaSonic G 550W 80 PLUS Gold ATX12V / EPS12V Semi-ModularOD: LG GH24NS95 DVD/CD WriterOS: Microsoft Windows 8 Professional (64-bit)', ""I bought the new Haswell i5-4570 so that I can play the latest games at either high or medium settings @ 1920x1080 resolution. Runs CS:GO and BF3 like a champ (200fps and 102 fps respectively).However, I ran into couple problem (really one, the other one is more of an annoyance) down the road.After a week, I noticed that the game was stuttering for a bit. My fps in CS:GO would start out from 200 fps and go down to 20 fps at times. I decided to investigate and found out that the CPU was idling around 80C and 100C under load through BIOS (MSI H87M-G43 REV 1.2) I thought the BIOS temp reader was off and used CPU Temp reader which said the same thing. I found this really strange as ambient temperature was around 20C (Hey I like to live cold - its also good for the computer :] ). Took a closer look and found out that the CPU fan was not running. It seemed like it was caught on a cpu fan wire but the actual problem was the CPU fan was not able to rotate at all. I always do CPU fan test before doing stress test so this caught me off guard. Replaced stock cooler with Cooler Master Hyper 101i and the problem went away.*On a side note, I really really really (can't emphasize this enough) dislike the intel's method of securing the CPU. Mine was really hard to secure (had to at put serious force onto the lever) and left a small indent on the sides. The cpu fan secure system on the sockets LGA 1156, 1155, and 1150 isn't the greatest either as I found the rotating mechanism really irritating when you have to work with small space.Otherwise, really happy with Intel's new Haswell.**On a second note, I read somewhere on Tomshardware about the design of the Haswell and its likelihood to run little hotter than her sisters' cores (Ivy Bridge and Sandy Bridge). Make sure you get an adequate cooling. The stock cooling is mediocre at best and the paste that comes with it is even worse.

I do semi-pro photography processing on my machine, and it's held up well and I've had no complaints about performance .. now I am looking at processing 4k video and thought maybe it's time to upgrade my CPU.  I wanted to stick to the motherboard I have, so I'd need to buy an i7 that fits an LGA-1150 socket, and there are some out there .. I think the money would be better spent on an upgraded GPU, though, since most video processing software makes use of a GPU.I wanted to just comment and say that my CPU, this trusty old i5, has been busy for six years now, faithfully enabling me to process whatever it is I need it for .. great processor."", ""This CPU is very good, providing very smooth and fast PC usage. Even though it's a tad slower than the 4670, I think it's worth going with this one instead if your budget really requires you to save that $20. Hasn't had issues running any games and it scores a CPUmark of around 7500 on Passmark, with single threaded hitting around 2200. I was initially going to get an FX-6300 with a good motherboard and overclock, but found out that even then it still wouldn't match a lower end Intel CPU in terms of single core performance. Which with that FX processor and a good board it would've cost as much as a micro ATX board and this CPU, so it wasn't worth it. I play Arma 3 and single core performance is key as the engine only utilizes two cores then scales. The single core performance of this CPU matches a stock clocked i7-3970X, which I find impressive.The bottom line, it's a superb mid-range CPU even with the lack of overclocking, and the stock cooler indeed works fine. I was a bit worried about the heat problems with Haswell, but the stock cooler is not having any issues. Pair this with a decent micro ATX board and you'll have yourself a powerful machine for a low price.Also, a tip for anyone having issues installing the CPU cooler, you turn the knobs counter-clockwise to pull the pins out of the spreaders, then you fit the cooler over the holes and then push down on them on opposite sides so that the pins fit in the spreaders securely. After this is done the cooler shouldn't move at all."", 'おかげさまで、サクサクと、快適です。', ""I was in a quandary with regard to a CPU when I decided to replace a dead motherboard.

But the Core i5 4670 cost almost as much as the Core i7 processors.  So, I went with this CPU (a little cheaper without a huge hit on performance), hoping it would be good enough for my modest computer use.  It was!  I installed it on my new ASRock motherboard and it performed plenty fast enough to do what I want.  It was excellent up until I greedily put another 8Gb of DDR3 memory in my motherboard and the motherboard died.  I've RMA'ed the motherboard to ASRock and am waiting for a replacement board.

The intel core i3 550 seemed like a good value, having the combination dual core + hyper threading and an onboard graphics processing unit.  The onboard gpu is nice because my motherboard does not have onboard graphics and if my PCI-e graphics card did not work for some reason I would still have a functional computer.Since this was my first computer build, I assembled it somewhat haphazardly and made some mistakes.  In the case of the processor, I did a really bad job applying thermal compound to the chip.  The stock heatsink comes with some kind of thermal pad stuck to the bottom and rather than use it alone or scrape it off and use my own compound (arctic silver), i left it on AND used the arctic silver.  Bad choice--idling was at about 40C and running prime95 for about 30 seconds got the cpu up to 80C.  These are not stable temperatures for a gaming computer (which can apply a load similar to prime95) so I checked the arctic silver website and found some good directions on how to apply thermal compound.Tips for applying thermal compound:-both cpu and heatsink surface need to be extremely clean (no dust/oil/hair/etc).  Rubbing alcohol is recommended.-you only use a very small amount of thermal compound--just to fill microscopic gaps between the heatsink and fan (ie the metal should do most of the heat conduction, not the compound).  In my case, i should have removed the thermal pad on the stock heatsink.-apply a small amount of thermal compound to both surfaces and work it in with the edge of a credit card, passing over repeatedly to spread the compound over the entire surface (DONT use your finger to spread it around).  This is to fill in the microscopic pores.  Remove excess with dry cloth or paper towel.-Now you need to find your respective model on the arctic silver (or whatever your compound is) website and read how to put the final application.  For the intel i3 550, you apply a line of thermal compound parallel to the long axis of the actual chip.End result:  idling at 29C and maxes out at 74C after an hour in prime95.  For a stock fan on a mini itx board in a small case (lian li pc-q11), i think that is pretty damn good. Gaming performance has been fine and i have had no stability issues at all.  Games I've played with it:  Batman arkham asylum, Red Alert 3, Warhammer 40k Dawn of War 2, Dead Space, Left 4 dead, and HL2 dm."", 'I bought this i3 processer to assemble a non gaming PC, and have been impressed with the speed that it works.I thought about the i5 or i7 but the cost of this i3 is well worth the money.', 'After hours trying to work out what cpu would meet my needs I went on the intel site and realised I basically just needed to decide whether to go for an i3, i5 or i7. All the variants of each are basically irrelevent for non-experts, just a question of deciding how much you want to spend, a bit like choosing between the 1.3 litre or 1.6 litre engine for your new car. Bottom line was that building a new pc bsed on i3 was way cheaper thn i5 or i7, and is absolutely fine for my casual gaming, office apps etc. Personally I think the speed of my computer is now dictated by the operating system (windows 7 64 bit); the i3 is obviously able to open and run apps as quickly as they are ready but still has to wait for windows to get itself together to begin with.', '中古の物だったけど価格の安さで購入、問題なく動いてくれたので個人的には満足している', 'Für 3€ Als mining rig CPU gut', 'El envio lo he recibido en perfectas condiciones, pero la idea es que lo enviaran todo junto y no por separado.

Generation), die weitaus mehr Leistung haben als die i7 7700k.', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0******Unboxing del processore Intel Core i7 7700K*****L’Intel Core i7 7700K viene venduto in una piccola scatolina, contenente anche un libretto con varie informazioni. Come tutti i processori Intel di fascia alta, anche l’Intel Core i7 7700K viene venduto senza dissipatore stock, che risulterebbe inutile in caso di overclock. Risulta quindi necessario dotarsi di un dissipatore after-market, ad aria o a liquido, a seconda delle esigenze. Nel mio caso ho utilizzato un Noctua NH-U9B SE2, un dissipatore ad aria, con doppia ventola da 92mm. Le temperature, durante l’utilizzo intenso, non hanno mai superato i 60 gradi, attestandosi tra i 45 e i 55 gradi al massimo.*******Caratteristiche tecniche del processore Intel Core i7 7700K********Il nuovo Intel Core i7 7700K presenta delle specifiche tecniche di alto livello. Come tutti i processori Kaby Lake, anche l’Intel Core i7 7700K è compatibile con socket LGA 1151 e con le schede madri Skylake. Nel mio caso ho utilizzato una ASRock H170 Pro4, aggiornando il BIOS UEFI all’ultima versione disponibile.Il processore presenta 4 core fisici e 8 thread, grazie alla tecnologia Hyper Threading di Intel. Ciò risulta determinante nelle applicazioni che sfruttano il multi-core. La frequenza base degli 8 thread è di 4.20 GHz, che arrivano a 4.50 GHz, grazie alla tecnologia Intel Turbo Boost. La memoria cache disponibile è di 8 MB e il TDP è di 91W, come il suo predecessore, l’Intel core i7 6700K Skylake. Come su tutti i processori K, anche sull’Intel Core i7 7700K è possibile eseguire overclock, in presenza della componentistica adatta. Con le schede madri Z270 non dovrebbero esserci problemi a raggiungere un clock di 5 GHz.L’Intel Core i7 7700K supporta RAM DDR4 fino a 2400 MHz e fino a 64 GB totali, utilizzando il dual-channel. Infatti il quad-channel è supportato solo dai processori Intel di fascia Enthusiast, come l’i7 6800K, che necessitano di un investimento maggiore. Non mancano tutte le più recenti tecnologie Intel e il set d’istruzioni è naturalmente a 64-bit.GPU integrataAll’interno dell’Intel Core i7 7700K si trova anche una GPU integrata Intel HD Graphics 630, con clock a 350 MHz e in grado di supportare la risoluzione del 4K a 60Hz. Naturalmente in gaming la scheda integrata non riesce a offrire prestazioni sufficienti, soprattutto nei titoli tripla A. Nei giochi meno pesanti o meno recenti si riesce comunque a giocare con i settaggi al minimo. In ogni caso, chi opta per questo processore, con l’intento del gaming, deve assolutamente acquistare una GPU dedicata.Prestazioni del processore Intel Core i7 7700KQuesto Intel Core i7 7700K offre prestazioni di alto livello, in tutti i campi, come ho potuto appurare dai benchmark e dall’utilizzo con vari software. Per i test ho usato una configurazione con queste caratteristiche principali: scheda madre ASRock H170 Pro4, GPU AMD Radeon R9 380X, 8 GB RAM DDR4 2133MHz, Windows 10 su SSD 240 GB Crucial. Ho lasciato le frequenze al livello stock, per avere un risultato facilmente comparabile.*****Benchmark*****Nei benchmark le prestazioni sono elevate. Nel Fire Strike di 3D Mark ho registrato un punteggio di 8381; in particolare nel test Physics, a carico prevalentemente della CPU, ho ottenuto un punteggio di 14011. L’Intel Core i7 7700K risulta essere del 75.7% più performante, in questo test, rispetto a un Intel Core i5 6600, appartenente alla sesta generazione di CPU Intel. Si nota subito come la presenza del doppio dei thread sull’i7, rispetto all’i5, porti notevoli benefici in questo test.Ho eseguito alcuni benchmark anche con CPU-Z e Passmark CPU Mark, con risultati interessanti. Infatti, il nuovo Intel Core i7 7700K risulta essere fino al 6% più potente di un i7 6700K, sia in single che in multi-thread. Nel benchmark Cinebench R15 per CPU (che consiste in un rendering foto-realistico), ho ottenuto un punteggio di 953 cb, che testimonia la superiorità del 7% sull’i7 6700K, e del 63% sull’i5 6600. Infine su Geekbench ho ottenuto 5215 punti in single e 16133 in multi thread.*********Gaming***********Nel gaming invece non si riscontrano particolari migliorie, rispetto a i7 6700K e i5 6600, poiché nei titoli attuali il carico maggiore grava sulla GPU. In particolare, nei titoli The Division e Steep, il miglioramento rispetto all’i5 6600, a parità di GPU, è stato solo di qualche FPS, come ho potuto anche osservare anche nei benchmark combinati di 3D Mark, dove il punteggio è uguale.*******Perché scegliere Intel Core i7 7700K?******In generale l’Intel Core i7 7700K è solo leggermente più potente dell’Intel Core i7 6700K, in tutte le tipologie di utilizzo, perciò sconsiglio l’upgrade in questa situazione. La storia naturalmente cambia in caso si voglia passare a un Intel Core i7 7700K, partendo da un i5 o da processori i7 più datati, dove il miglioramento delle prestazioni è più netto. In particolare i benefici maggiori di un upgrade a Intel Core i7 7700K si riscontrano nelle operazioni multi thread, come il rendering di video e di immagini, mentre nel gaming conta maggiormente la GPU.Rispetto a Skylake, i processori Kaby Lake, come l’Intel Core i7 7700K, hanno il supporto alla codifica e decodifica hardware nativa dei filmati HEVC in 4K, con profondità di 10 bit, e i filmati VP9 di YouTube. Questo si traduce in prestazioni migliori nella fruizione di contenuti in 4K, per esempio su Netflix, anche dal punto di vista dei consumi.', 'Ciao Amici!Ci tengo a condividere con voi alcuni pensieri a proposito di questo attrezzino di CPU chiamato Intel core i7-7700K.Intanto comincio con il dire che l\'ho acquistato per costruirmi una workstation potente ed affidabile su cui poter fare della buona virtualizzazione, con un buon multitasking e con una certa velocità di calcolo. In quest\'ottica dunque 5 stelle ci stanno tutte.Se avessi voluto farmi un PC da gaming avrei molto più probabilmente scelto un i5 oppure un favoloso ed economicissimo pentium G4560 (provare per credere).Sorgono dunque alcune domande:- perchè la maggior parte dei gamers inserisce nella propria build questa CPU?- cosa significa ""unlocked"" e quali vantaggi porta in termini di prestazioni?- perchè questo processore, così come la stragrande maggioranza delle CPU Intel, è dotato di una scheda grafica integrata?- che differenza c\'è tra i7, i5, i3 e i9?- qual\'è il maggior vantaggio competitivo rispetto ai Ryzen della concorrenza AMD?Provo a dare una risposta a queste domande, che si basa sulla mia esperienza personale. Non sono un ingegnere, sono semplicemente uno a cui piace cercare di capire e conoscere quello che acquista.La intel nel corso degli anni ha migliorato sempre più la sua strategia di marketing, In linea generale in passato si è sempre rivolta al mercato delle workstation mentre da qualche anno si è gettata a capofitto e con ottimi risultati nel settore dei gamers. Lo ha fatto sfruttando e incentivando al tempo stesso l\'onda di entusiasmo dei consumatori nei confronti di tutti quei blog/vlog/canali di youtube che si occupano di dare consigli su come crearsi la propria gaming rig. È dunque successo che chi assembla PC di professione ha cominciato ad inserire nelle build per gaming la CPU consumer (quindi escludendo xeon e altri) più potente sul mercato, la i7-7700 per capirci, insieme alla miglior GPU del momento, la RAM più veloce, l\'alimentatore più sovradimensionato e la scheda madre più tamarra.I giovani (e non) appassionati di gaming hanno dunque cominciato ad emulare i loro beniamini e hanno comprato CPU i7 come se piovesse. Solo i più ""sgamati"" hanno capito che un i5 era molto più che sufficiente, risparmiando così un bel po\'.Si è dunque creato un circolo virtuoso (per intel) grazie al quale nei risultati dei benchmark pubblicati in rete figurava sempre questo i7 che così ha portato ancora più clienti gamers. In più molti di questi utenti avevano anche dichiaratamente overclockato la CPU (unlocked significa che è possibile fare overclock) per ottenere risultati ancora migliori.Mo\', per quello che ne so io, i videogame di ultima generazione sfruttano moltissimo la GPU e poco la CPU. Allo stesso tempo hanno bisogno di dischi e RAM velocissimi per dare ottime prestazioni. Il core i7 è un quad core con 8 thread e non credo esista alcun gioco che sfrutti questa sua capacità.Questo significa per esempio che con un SSD NVMe samsung 960 evo, una nvidia 1080 ti (di qualsiasi oem), 32 Gb di RAM DDR4@2400Mhz, che voi abbiate un i7 o un i5 o addirittura un Pentium G4560 potrete comunque giocare a qualsiasi gioco sulla faccia della terra con la differenza che risparmierete davvero molto se opterete per l\'ultimo. Tuttalpiù quel che conta è fare un overclock della scheda video. Il risultato sarà una manciata di frame al secondo in più o in meno, ma se poi avete dei monitor FHD a 60hz non vi serve a nulla in qualsiasi caso.Il fatto che i processori intel siano dotati di GPU integrata poi la dice lunga sul motivo percui sono stati creati: Se quello di cui hai bisogno è molta capacità computazionale nella tua workstation, ma non ti serve avere capacità grafica (quindi non fai modellazione 3d o gaming), per te è perfetto un i7 senza nessuna scheda video dedicata (tipo nvidia GTX o AMD). Se invece usi il tuo PC come multimedia center, per fruire di contenuti multimediali, non ti serve un i7, ti basta un i3.Quali sono dunque le differenze tra i vari processori intel? Principalmente le seguenti due:1) la quantità di calcoli al secondo;2) il consumo.L\' i9 per esempio viene chiamato ""fornetto"" perchè consuma e quindi scalda come un forno a fronte di una modesta capacità di calcolo in più rispetto all\' i7. Un i3 dal canto suo è perfetto per chi necessita di poca capacità di calcolo e consumi ridotti (va benissimo anche per il gaming non hardcore). L\' i5 sta nel mezzo: perfetto per il gaming, non granchè come workstation.E quali sono invece le differenze in termini di prestazioni tra intel core e amd ryzen?Anche qui sono principalemente due:1) a parità di fascia di prezzo (prendiamo per esempio i7-7700k e Ryzen 7 1700) i Ryzen hanno più core e più thread e sono più veloci nelle operazioni multicore (non gaming dunque);2) i Ryzen distribuiscono il carico di lavoro su più core e consumano meno.Quindi i Ryzen sono mediamente migliori come workstation e peggiori come gaming.L\'utilizzo che faccio io di questo i7 nello specifico è questo:mentre Blender sta renderizzando in 3D sulla GPU (una 1080), guardo video su youtube oppure netflix, e sul terzo monitor lavoro su file libreoffice calc (tipo excel). Qualche volta, mentre faccio le tre cose insieme compirmo i file su cui sto lavorando per spedirli via e-mail o caricarli su Dropbox. Tutto questo con una virtual machine avviata con windows 7 (a cui ho dedicato 4 degli 8 thread e 16 dei miei 32Gb di RAM) per quelle cose che non posso fare su Ubuntu (tipo photoshop e il mio gestionale ERP).Per come la vedo io questo è uno di quei casi in cui ha senso avere un i7-7700K overclockato + una nvidia GTX 1080 overclockata e RAM da vendere.Qui di seguito la mia build:MOBO -\xa0\nMSI Z270 Gaming M5 Scheda Madre, Interfaccia ATX, Socket Intel 1151, Nero\nCPU -\xa0\nIntel Core i7-7700K 4.2GHz 8MB Cache intelligente Scatola\nCPU FAN -\xa0\nArctic Freezer i11 CO Dissipatore per CPU con Ventola da 92 mm per Intel, 500-2000 rpm\nPSU -\xa0\nCorsair CX750M CP-9020061-EU Alimentatore ATX/EPS, Serie CXM, 750 W, certificazione 80+ Bronze, Semi Modulare, Nero\nGPU -\xa0\nZOTAC GeForce GTX 1080 8GB AMP!

Al ser la versión K se puede muy fácilmente desde la BIOS aumentar el multiplicador FSB de 45 a uno superior. Esto se hace de forma diferente dependiendo de cada placa base.Lo recomiendo para juegos porque da más rendimiento en aplicaciones que usen pocos núcleos debido a que la frecuencia de operación máxima por núcleo es mayor que en la serie X.En mi opinión tiene un problema con las temperaturas máximas. Por defecto ya me alcanza 90º con pruebas de estrés de alta carga (superpi y minado simultáneo durante 8 horas). Con 5GHz (50x) arranca pero en las pruebas se alcanza al momento el TJMAX.

Este material se aplica entre lo que es el silicio del procesador y la carcasa metálica que se ve externamente y provoca que las temperaturas sean bastante elevadas en general a pesar de la reducción de nanómetros de las sucesivas generaciones de i7. Hasta la segunda generación de i7 se venía usando el elemento ""Indium"" (In) pero ahora ya no y parece que se nota.De hecho alguna gente le quita la parte metálica para sustituir el material termoconductor por otro de más calidad (de-lidding) en lo que se podría llamar ya overcloking extremo. Incluso hay empresas que se dedican a ello (Silicon Lottery) y otras que venden material para hacerlo uno mismo (Rockit 88). Esta técnica no la recomiendo a no ser que tengáis mucho tiempo libre y seáis super expertos y/o no os importe cargaros el micro.', 'Ottimo, solo ha delle temperature altissime. Quindi consiglio un buon raffreddamento', ""Bonsoir très bon processeur pour ma carte mère ASUS z170 pro gaming , dommage qu'il me soit livré sans l'emballage bleu d'origine."", 'Mit dem Kauf des Dan Cases A4-SFX war auch ein Mini-ITX-Board fällig und ich hatte beschlossen, dass mein i5-3570K nach fünf Jahren in Rente gehen darf. Da der i5 bereits seit Jahren auf 4,4 GHz übertaktet wurde, blieb als einzige sinnvolle Leistungssteigerung nur der i7-7700K. Alle anderen Prozessoren hätten entweder Einbußen beim Takt oder eine zu hohe Verlustwärme im neuen Case.Als Kühler kommt der ""Noctua L9i"" zum Einsatz, der nur bedingt für 91 Watt-CPUs geeignet ist. Aufgrund der beengten Platzverhältnisse im Case blieben beim Kühler allerdings kaum Alternativen, die nicht bedeutend lauter sind.Aufgrund dessen und der hier auch schon mehrfach angesprochenen schlechten Wärmeübertragung zwischen dem eigentlichen Prozessor und dem Heatspreader wurde die CPU geköpft und mit ""Coollaboratory Liquid Pro"" versehen, was signifikante Verbesserungen zur Folge hatte:Vor dem Köpfen drosselte die CPU nach nur wenigen Sekunden ihren Takt, da die Temperatur über die 100 °C-Marke schoss und die Schutzmaßnahmen der CPU aktivierten. Nach dem Köpfen läuft der Prozessor nun sogar leicht übertaktet mit folgenden Werten stabil in Prime95 v26.6:CPU: 4500 Mhz, VCore: 1,232 V, CPU-Fan: 2500 U/Min, durchschnittliche Temperatur: 88°CIn Spielen ist die Temperatur erfahrungsgemäß 10-15% niedriger als in Prime. Je nach Nutzung liegt die Temperatur dort zwischen 70 und 82°C (getestet in ""The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt"", ""GTA 5"" und ""Mafia 3""). Dabei unterschreitet keines der Spiele in einer Auflösung von 1440p @ Ultra die 60 fps-Marke - was genau mein Anspruch ist.Weitere Angaben zur Hardware:Asus Z270I Strix32 GB Corsair Vengeance 3200 MHzAsus GTX 1080 Strix Advanced (manuell OC)Corsair SF450Ich habe daher nichts zu bemängeln. Einzig Intels Firmenpolitik qualitativ schlechte Wärmeleitpaste unter den Heatspreader zu packen wenn das Verlöten schon zu teuer ist, kann ich nicht nachvollziehen. Diese Problematik ist aber nicht neu und hatte auch schon meinen i5-3570K betroffen, weshalb ich mich bei beiden trotz GARANTIEVERLUST dazu entschlossen hatte sie zu köpfen.UPDATE 08.03.2017Nach Verwendung von ""Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut"" als Wärmeleitpaste zwischen IHS und dem Kühler sowie einem etwas höheren Anpressdruck konnte ich die Temperaturen sogar noch weiter senken:CPU: 4500 Mhz, VCore: 1,232 V, CPU-Fan: 2500 U/Min, durchschnittliche Temperatur: 77°C, der höchste Auschlag war 79°C.', ""Di fronte ad un processore sbloccato come il 7700k, ci si aspetta un certo margine possibile di overclock. E in effetti è così visto che in teoria si può spingere fino a 5ghz, poco più per le cpu più fortunate e poco meno nei casi peggiori. Il problema è che Intel per la dissipazione del calore generato dal DIE utilizza della semplice pasta termica; una pasta termica di scarsissima qualità, che rende impossibile incrementare il voltaggio mantenendo temperature sicure.In questo caso la strada da intraprendere è il Delidding. Si può optare per l'utilizzo di una lametta, soluzione economica ma anche rischiosa, in un attimo si può danneggiare la cpu e renderla inutilizzabile – solo per esperti. Altrimenti ci sono i kit appositi come il Delid-Die-Mate 2 (non disponibile qui su Amazon, ma si trova a 30€ circa). In pochi minuti avrete scoperchiato la cpu e non resterà che:1. Grattare via i residui di colla2. Rimuovere la pasta termica con un fazzoletto, rimuovete ogni traccia aiutandovi con l'alcool isopropilico3. Applicare appena una goccia di pasta termica e spalmare; mai come in questo caso vale la pena utilizzare composti a base di metallo liquido: la migliore è la Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut\xa0\nThermal Grizzly Conductonaut grasso termico incolla - 1,0 g\n, altrimenti valide alternative sono le Coollaboratory Liquid Ultra/Pro.4. Riposizionare il “coperchio” mediante UHU silicone ad alta temperatura\xa0\nUhu 46735 - Silicone ad alta temperatura, 80 ml, nero\n5. Lasciare asciugare per 1 ora, tenendola sotto pressione con lo strumento compreso con il kit. Attenzione a non stringere troppo, basta una rotazione di appena 90° (un quarto di giro) dal momento in cui avviene il contatto con il coperchio.La procedura non è particolarmente insidiosa e si guadagnano 20°C sulla temperatura; certo bisogna considerare se il margine di OC guadagnato possa giustificare non solo il rischio ma anche il costo aggiuntivo di tutto il necessario. Inevitabilmente il rapporto performance/per euro speso ne risente, però se si vuole alleviare il dissipatore da un carico eccessivo e guadagnarne anche in termini acustici e con inoltre la possibilità di spingersi più in là in OC.. allora si, ne vale la pena."", ""Il prodotto è arrivato nei tempi stabiliti, la confezione era un po' schiacciata ma ringrazio di cuore chi ha preparato il pacco perché ha avuto l'intelligenza di mettere il processore rivolto all'interno del pacco stesso così da evitare danni all'articolo!!Ho associato questo processore ad una scheda madre gigabyte z270x gaming 7 e ad un dissipatore h115i della corsair, in una prima fase devo dire che non sono affatto rimasto soddisfatto perché ho raggiunto temperature abbastanza alte 75-77°c durante stress test con il processore a pieno carico, dopo varie ricerche e tentativi di settaggio via software ho scoperto che era meglio intervenire manualmente nel bios e ho scoperto questa configurazione: bisogna innanzitutto regolare il VCORE del processore a 1.150 (default 1.250), assicurarsi che il moltiplicatore del processore sia regolato per i 4.2 GHz, quindi a 42, ( la mia scheda madre parte già impostata di fabbrica a 45, quindi 4.5 GHz), assicurarsi di regolare il moltiplicatore per ogni core a 42 e di conseguenza assicurarsi che l'UNCORE sia impostato a 42, con questi pochi passaggi sono riuscito ad arrivare ad una temperatura finale di 62°C massimi con il processore in full load ed il dissipatore in modalità silenziosa.Onestamente credo sia un ottimo risultato senza dover eseguire il delid del processore, che ne invaliderebbe la garanzia.In seguito ho eseguito un test portando il processore a 4.5 GHz e le temperature si sono mantenute stabili ad un valore massimo di 65-66°C, la stanza dove tengo il pc ha temperature attorno ai 27-29 gradi!Concludo facendo presente che questi settaggi sono di riferimento per questa specifica scheda madre e penso che in qualche modo possano addattarsi anche ad altri modelli/marche esistenti, viste anche le varie recensioni negative per questo processore considerato da molti utenti ottimo ma con temperature fuori norma."", 'Un mostro.Niente da dire.Nemmeno overclockato e sprigiona già di base una potenza imparagonabile al suo antenato 4770k, ancora in mio possesso.Preso per velocizzare l\'encoding con Avisynth+ sia con x264 sia con x265, la differenza con haswell si nota: già solo 2 frames di velocità in più significano minimo 30 minuti in meno di elaborazione, e sappiamo che Avisynth è lento, in tutte le sue varianti.Non lo uso per giocare né per overclock, e qui la domanda è spontanea: perché prendere una serie K se non si overclocka o non si gioca? Perché la differenza con il 7700 è netta, 600 MHz di differenza per singolo core sulla frequenza di base della CPU.Chi usa Avisynth, o comunque Vapoursynth, sa che il clock della CPU è fondamentale.Dove casca l\'asino? Sulle temperature (e da lì quattro stelle).Per tenere a bada questo mostro, non ho idea di quale dissipatore possa farlo.Sicuramente un liquido da 240 mm, e già si rischia il surriscaldamento con conseguente spegnimento del PC. Io lo ""tengo a bada"" con un Lepa Aquacharger 240 mm e in idle non supera i 40 gradi, ma durante l\'encoding si va oltre i 90 gradi e si rischia il surriscaldamento (il quale mi è già successo).Il dissipatore in questione funziona, sennò non sarei qui a recensire, e la CPU non fa mai una piega, ma le temperature sono un grosso problema, soprattutto per chi non vuole fare delidding.Conclusione: questa CPU è un mostro di potenza, ma come tenerla a bada senza superare gli 80 gradi e i 100€ di spesa?']"
