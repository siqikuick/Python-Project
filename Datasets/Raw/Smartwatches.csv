On time delivery', 'You get all the features of expensive brands', 'Well receive the items and like it very much', ""A great value-for-money buy @S$89. nice size and screen, ok UI, and integration with google fit and strava. does everything well enough, does nothing great so buy if value is key for you, else go for something else.. battery life is decent, 14days as advertised with light usage and 10min HR monitoring. The blood oxygen reading doesn't work for me unless the watch is in the exact right spot. the GTS4 Mini was a good contender but I dont think the nicer screen and build could beat the lowerr price of the Bip 3 pro. The onboard GPS is a nice touch, but I think I could have gone for the bip3 too without regretting it ."", 'i like the tracking data provided eg sleep, heart rate, etc.however, the heart rate monitoring is faulty past few days.i would appreciate advice from Amason on next step ?', 'It’s too small and barely fits.', 'Very happy with this buying, much better than expected, easy to use and the battery can last more than 3 weeks before any re-charge', 'like it', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Disculpen el movimiento 😂 solo tenía una mano libre y con la misma sostenía el cel y le movía al reloj.Aquí mi opinión por punto.Me gustó:* Su diseño. Es muy ligero y con el tiempo ya ni notas que lo tienes puesto. En mi caso lo uso con algunas pulseras y ya le da un toque más femenino. Puedes seleccionar entre varios fondos de pantalla inicial y cambiarlo de tanto en tanto.* Duración de la pila. Lo cargo solo una vez a la semana. Eso sí, al principio me duraba la mitad de ese tiempo porque tenía todas las funciones activadas y la verdad a mí no me interesaba mucho eso de medir la presión o el pulso de forma continúa entonces tú lo configuras según el uso que le quieras dar.* Funciones. Puedes configurar algunas funciones para ""inicio rápido"" solo deslizando a la derecha en la página inicial y eso me resulta muy útil. En mi caso poder moverle a la bocina/música desde el reloj me parece una maravilla ✨. Una vez en clases de escalada tenía vinculado mi CEL a las bocinas del lugar y poder estar ejercitando y cambiando de música o volumen sin necesidad de cargar el cel conmigo fue un gran plus.* Calidad/precio. Me parece adecuado.No me gusto tanto:* Precisión. La cuenta de los pasos marca bien, los saltos, los trotes... el detalle es cuando vas en auto o camión, a mí me sigue marcando y me desorienta de mi meta, no le encuentro una forma de ""pausarlo"" para que no cuente esos trayectos y eso lo hace no del todo confiable.* App. Al princio tenia una función para pausar la cuenta del reloj pero en una actualización se lo quitaron, me imagino para hacer menos útil este modelo y así que compres uno más nuevo.', ""Apparently Amazon considers the AMAZFIT 3 Pro and the AMAZFIT 5 the same product so the bottom is my original review of the AMAZFIT 3 Pro while the top is the newer 5.AMAZFIT BIP 5First the Black watch is very grey.  I first thought they sent me the wrong one but they don't make a grey model.  The face is black but the sides/back and band are medium grey.  I hate rubber watch bands and replaced it with a nice black stainless steel band.  I expected to do this going in.  They provide a cheap grey rubber band like every other watch maker out there.Software interface Zepp.  The Zepp interface is very cryptic and hard to use.  It takes a lot of time to find what you are looking for as nothing is where you would expect it.  After a while you kind of learn it.  Once you get the watch setup you will rarely use the Zepp interface.  If your into following everything it tracks then that is on the main screen as you enter the app.  I cannot say how well it tracks stuff as I really just bought a watch.Watch faces.  You would think a smart what would have some good  and basic watch faces but in reality the ones include are pretty lame.  If you are looking for a watch with hands there are a few good ones.  If you are looking for a digital watch they are mostly bad.  There is very little you can customize.  I ended up using one where I supplied the back ground and you could put one item above like a date and below like the weather.  You could not change the color of the print though which means you have to specifically look for backgrounds that will show white text.Getting notifications set correctly is not easy.  You will also be double, tipple and quadruple notified of some things like emails or texts.  It almost seems like when ever the phone sees a notification even though it is not sent to watch it resends the last message it will send.  So you end up being notified of same message over and over again.  A few comparisons of the 5 to the 3 Pro.  The 5 has a slightly bigger screen.  More in look than feel as you would not notice it on your arm.  The screen allows more to be shown in messages sent which is helpful.  Overall the bigger display is a good thing.  It did not get to big as to be giant on the arm.  You can answer phone calls on the 5 which you cannot on the 3 pro.  That was the main reason I got it.  Battery life.  I charged it Friday,  It is now Wednesday and it is at 51%.  There 10 days battery life is a pretty good estimate.  I would guess you charge it every weekend and your good.  Screen Sensitivity.  Operating the screen means you are swiping up down left and right.  Down gets you settings,  Left or right gets you basic apps and health tracking.  if in one of those swiping right is return (which is the only one that really does not work well).  Up gets you texts and emails.  If you hit the button it will bring up installed apps.Overall I am happy with the purchase.  Once setup it works well it just takes a little to get to that point.AMAZFIT BIP 3 ProMy first attempt to buy a smart watch was years ago  as a samsung watch and there were just to many issues.  It was bulky and batter life as maybe 2 days.  So I went back to a real watch because that's all I really needed.  Fast forward to 2022 and Black Friday.  I picked up the Amazfit Bip 3 Pro for around 50.00.My first impression was it was a good size. My wrists are small and it was in the size range I wanted.  It is very light with the included band and a little heavier with my replacement SS band.  Really in the range of any watch though.My second thought was on the band.  It was a rubberized substance which I really hate.  I used it for about a week and decided it was not for me.  I was worried but this uses a standard size and there are a lot of bands out there that will fit this on Amazon. I ended up getting a stainless steel replacement for 10.00.  and just love it.The Battery life is spot on their estimate.  It claimed 14 days.  I am past 14 days at 19% power.  To me this is good.  You can charge it every 2 weeks and not be worried you will run out towards the end.The movement to turn on seems well done.  It comes on when you move your wrist to view but really does not come on by just moving your wrist or arm.  You will need to remember to turn this feature off at night.  You can set times when it is active.  I have mine set from 7AM to 11PM and if I need it after that just hit the button.  If you don't it will come on when you don't want it to and its bright.There are a minimal number of clock faces.  It would be nice if there were more.  I actually use the default and have one standard watch face if I want to look fancier.You can get text and email notifications but they are not the best.  You cannot reply to anything though.You can answer calls but there is no mic or speaker so it really does you know good.  Im not sure I want to look like Dick Tracey and talk into my arm.I don't really use the measuring features as I really just wanted a watch.  I have played with them and they seem to be right but I really have no way to tell that.I bought this as a watch and the battery life and screen resolution make this a good choice.Overall I bought this""]"

Apple watch also tracks this info, but for me the info was overwhelming and not organized very well. In addition, Apple watch needs to be charged pretty much every day, which was a major drawback. I don't use other smartwatch functions like music/wifi/etc., so I didn't need the extra apps.I like the Fitbit sense 2 because it has a physical button, can use Suica, and tracks fitness/wellness really well. Unfortunately, it does not accept credit cards that are not from Sony bank or Paypay (even if they are visa), so I end up just charging suica to my credit card so I can pay with my watch. It also doesn't have the Google Wallet app as an option, probably because I'm located in Japan. This was unfortunate! However, I still decided to keep it because I find Suica and the fitness tracking are my primary concerns. Also love that the battery lasts 6 days!"", 'I love the Sense 2 Fitbit for all the health stats it collects, and also the mindful wellness checks through the day.  I was also pleasantly surprised that the watchband is very smooth and comfortable (unlike previous fitbits where I’ve had to replace the stock band with a leather one for comfort). Only problem is that the battery drains really fast and I have to charge it more often than I anticipated.', 'senseからsense2へ買い替えしました。スマホとのBluetoothが切れにくく、繋がりやすくなってとても使いやすくなりました。senseもそうですが、睡眠の質やスポーツジムへ行く時、自販機やお店のお買い物での支払いなど常に使える商品です。着信もLINE、メールも知らせてくれるのも良い◎GoogleMAPを是非使ってみたいです。', 'Ok update I also purchased a Samsung Galaxy 4 which was cheaper and bigger but now I see why fitbit is betterFitbit lasts 5 days galaxy watch not even a single day .If you are looking for reliable and less expensive ECG watch then this is the best. Although it lacks at few features such a good phone connection and barometer but over all good battery life is long', 'I use the Fitbit to track my steps, check weather, see texts, check my calendar and keep myself moving.  I so wanted to love this Sense 2, but am unable to, as there are way too many DISLIKES. I want compatibility with iPhone and Android phones (which it has). Long battery life, which it has. Here are my LIKES and DISLIKES:Like - quick charging (less than 30 minutes) 3-5 days between charges.Like - nice display, clear audio alerts, perfect vibration alerts.Like - works with iPhone and Android phones.Like - large & small watch bands included.Like - easy to change watch bands.Like - step count, distance and floors climbed seem accurate.Like - Fitbit replaced the haptic button (on Versa 3) with a real button.Like - iPhone FitBit app works well & easy to use.Like - hundreds of watch faces to choose from (many free ones).Dislike - Heart rate monitoring fluctuates wildly.Dislike - Sleep tracking inaccurate or missing.Dislike - Zone Minutes wildly inaccurate, off by more than 30%.Dislike - Agenda app (from Versa 3) is gone, so no way to scroll thru reminders from my iPhone.Dislike - keeps dropping “Sense 2 calls” Bluetooth connection.Dislike - Weather tile says “no weather data available”, or is 30+ minutes out dated.Dislike - Google wallet and Google maps “not yet available”.Dislike - on-wrist Bluetooth calls “not yet available”.Dislike - Fitbit is now owned by Google.Dislike - will Google stop support / sales of Fitbit line?That’s my take on the Fitbit Sense 2; very interesting watch, but too many DISLIKES for a watch that sells for 400$ CDN. Inaccurate heart rate measurements kills the whole idea of it monitoring stress and sleep. It’s almost as though Google doesn’t want the new Fitbit Sense to work properly, so they can delete the whole Fitbit line of smartwatches, and move users to Google Pixel smartwatches.', 'This is by far the best smart watch, even better than the Apple watch BUT I’m allergic to the bracelet and the back of the watch, so I returned it. I hope they will get a better quality charging back and bracelet so I can go back to Fitbit.', ""I wanted to like this. I really did. But I can't.The interface is so poorly designed and unreasonably complicated to navigate (ie. No setting multiple workout shortcuts, you can quick select the last three you've done, otherwise you better like scrolling) and they have ridiculous software bugs what have existed for MONTHS that they refuse to fix/ignore/offer silly workarounds for (ie. A bug that inverts every workout session from AM to PM and vice versa).I used it for one day. Had to return it. Even $100 off isn't enough to justify buying this hunk of junk.I've had Fitbits for years. I LOVE my original Sense. I've had problems with them before, like the chronic broken band of the Charge 2. But this is just sad.Looks like all their resources are going into the Pixel Watch instead. So maybe try there, unless you like to be frustrated.""]"

Así que, pensando en todas las ventajas del modelo previo, mi elección por el nuevo modelo ha sido clara.El producto se envía en una caja alargada, más actual. Me ha gustado mucho que los manuales de uso y funcionamiento están más cuidados, y se nota. Aparte del propio reloj, tenemos un cable de carga USB (sigue utilizando el mismo sistema del modelo previo. La presentación es buena y el producto viene correctamente protegido, en una base de plástico moldeado.El reloj es muy grande, tanto como el anterior. Aunque el diámetro es casi el mismo (sin contar la corona), la distancia de pasadores es unos milímetros mayor. Pero como el modelo anterior, la comodidad de uso está garantizada con un peso de tan solo 44 gramos, con una altura muy conseguida de tan solo 12,2 milímetrosEl sensor en la parte trasera es totalmente nuevo, está muy bien integrado en la carcasa trasera.Otro buen detalle es el uso de correas estándar, en este caso de 24 mm (lo que me parece un acierto para un reloj con estas dimensiones). A diferencia de otras marcas, puedes utilizarlo con cualquier tipo de correa (siempre que no sea NATO y tape el sensor). La que viene de fábrica es de caucho, muy cómoda.La carcasa está fabricada en plástico con un agradable tacto que no deja marcas de uso, siendo la corona metálica y fija con moleteado en la parte superior.El diseño me ha sorprendido bastante. Las líneas son bastante clásicas, y dispone de una corona en la parte derecha del reloj, a las 3, que resalta aún más su aspecto elegante. Visto desde lejos, a no ser por su pantalla, da toda la sensación de reloj analógico. Puedes disimularlo en la manga de tu camisa y chaqueta, y puedes usarlo en la playa. Sigues teniendo en tu muñeca lo mejor de los dos mundos, un completo acierto. Además, sigue estando certificado bajo estándar militar MIL-STD 810H. Y 5 atm de resistencia al agua. Y cristal Corning Gorilla… es cierto que quizás puedas encontrar smartwatches más resistentes. Quizás. Pero ¿a este precio?Lo que más llama la atención en su gran pantalla. Es más grande que la anterior (ahora dispone de 1,43”) pero mantiene un agradable acuerdo de proporciones entre ésta y el cuerpo del reloj.Y hablando de pantallas, este reloj mantiene una de las grandes características de esta marca, su doble pantalla. Pero mejorada:- Puedes programar el modo esencial del reloj (pantalla de bajo consumo) a las horas que quieras, así como ajustando el nivel de batería mínimo con el que quieres que se active)- La pantalla de bajo consumo puede mostrar varias funcionalidades añadidas, solo con el uso de la corona (ritmo cardíaco, calorías, oxígeno en sangre y brújula). Todo eso sin encender la pantalla AMOLED. Es increíble.- Cuando haces ejercicio, te muestra con colores el rango de ritmo cardíaco en el que te encuentras.Una de mis quejas con el modelo antiguo era que la pantalla de bajo consumo no dejaba de ser algo muy poco útil, salvo para consultar la hora. Ahora lo tienes todo. Se nota que han pensado qué importaba al plantear este nuevo diseño.Y otro detalle, quizás creas que no es importante… pero la pantalla no se mancha. ¿Sabes lo incómodo que es tener que estar limpiando continuamente la pantalla de tu reloj? En este reloj TicWatch, la pantalla permanece limpia. Y aumenta todavía más el magnífico aspecto del reloj.Otro aspecto brutal es su batería. Según las especificaciones de Mobvoi, dispone de una batería de 628 mAh (típica) ¡¡!! Yo me considero un usuario “average” con este tipo de dispositivos. Y os puedo compartir qué valores he obtenido con 100% de carga:- 12 primeras horas: batería al 90% de carga- 24 primeras horas: batería al 74% de carga- 48 primeras horas: batería al 47% de carga- 72 primeras horas: batería al 16% de cargaTodo esto sin utilizar en ningún momento el modo esencial. En este modo, el fabricante garantiza 40 días de uso ¡¡!!Creo que uno de los elementos que favorecen este ahorro de energía es el uso de la última generación de procesadores. En este caso han utilizado el Snapdragon W5, que junto a los 2 Gb de RAM permiten una experiencia de uso muy agradable, con transiciones entre pantallas muy reducidas y con mucha soltura.Como su anterior modelo, el sistema operativo es Wear OS de Google. Ahora, es imperativo el registro en la aplicación del fabricante (ya no puedes utilizar tu smartwatch desde la app de wear OS). Este proceso es muy sencillo, gracias a la nueva aplicación de Mobvoi (Mobvoi health). La integración con todas las aplicaciones de Google es perfecta, y puedes utilizar tanto las nativas, como las de Google.El sistema nos permite realiza compras rápidas y sin complicaciones usando nuestro reloj en tiendas que admitan pagos NFC. Permite utilizar la tecnología incorporada para realizar pagos sin contacto con Google Pay con prácticamente cualquier tipo de tarjetas. Esto es muy importante, no todos los fabricantes permiten ofrecer este servicio.Impresionante todas las funciones de seguimiento de salud disponibles.

This is the first ever smartwatch using the new Snapdragon W5+ chipset.  Combine this with the unique battery saving features of this watch and the battery life trumps the competition.  Overall, this watch is best all around for any person of any age who values convenience and health tracking.I\'ll start with the things I think could be improved:1) When setting this watch up, it made me install a new Mobvoi Health app onto my phone.  This apparently was due to the fact that it is the first Mobvoi watch rocking Wear OS 3. I guess there is some incompatibility with the previous watches and how the apps are built.  This in and of itself is not a big deal... BUT coming from the ticwatch pro 3, all my activities and things were stored on my account in the previous app.  When I signed in on the new Mobvoi Health app, it did not bring that previous activity over with it.  Not a deal breaker... just an annoyance.  All my activities are imported to Strava and google fit as well anyways which don\'t care where the data came from.  A quick email response from Mobvoi on this topic said that their engineers are working on a solution to this that should be released soon.This watch has just about all the hardware features in a modern smartwatch... Wifi, bluetooth, pulse rate, skin temp, blood oxygen, compass, GPS, NFC,2) Like the TWP3, the band in the box is this rubbery black material that rubs on my wrist in such a way where it leaves some irritation during the day.  I suppose this could be remedied by buying a new band... but why?? Just include one that doesn\'t irritate the wearer\'s wrist?  Maybe this is just an issue with me.3) Being a Google Pixel Phone user for years, I\'m used to frequent and consistent operating system updates.  This is my third Ticwatch from Mobvoi and if previous experience remains true, this watch will not see many software updates.  Perhaps in the first year of use it will but after that I feel Mobvoi puts all their attention on the next flagship device.  The TWP3 is supposed to get Wear OS 3. I hope I\'m wrong.  I guess if software updates are important for me on my watch, I should go for the Pixel watch or Samsung... The responsiveness of customer service from Mobvoi keeps me coming back however.Here\'s what I like.1) My main purpose for having this watch is to track runs and walks.  I know what you\'re thinking.. why not just get a Garmin... It does that better than any Android or Apple smartwatch.  I\'ve found through reviews and my experience that they do not get the other features right... like notifications and calls and texts, etc that an Android Wear watch could.  So, since this is a Wear 3.0 watch, it links right up with my Google Pixel 6 Pro.  The default exercise app, TicExercise, does the job handsomely.  I\'ve found that the GPS tracking is far more accurate.  The app continues to link with Strava and Google Fit.  As soon as my workout is done and the watch connects with my phone, the workout shows up on Strava.  HEartrate, pace, calories, distance and duration move right over into Strava... MEanwhile in the Mobvoi health app, it goes the extra mile and tracks VO2Max and shows calculations such as step frequency and step length.  I feel like this watch and the supporting software accomplishes what previous Wear OS watches have stopped short.2) I use the ""Color Run"" watchface.  It shows my heartrate, blood oxygen, battery, steps and distance walked and barometer... there\'s also a shortcut to the compass if you need that.  Super helpful info accessible simply by looking at my watch.  The ""complications"" on this watchface (the shortcuts to other apps or data) are fully customizeable.  There are a handful of other watchfaces that have differing levels of complexity.3) The feature that sets this watch apart from every other watch out there is the dual display.  For battery savings, the OLED screen is off in favor of a battery sipping display that shows the time, date, battery, pulse rate, and steps.  It also shows whether you have new notifications.  The TicExercise app uses this display to show a summary of your current workout AND shows in color the intensity of your workout... From green, blue, yello to red based on your heartrate.  A backlight also illuminates when you turn your wrist to look at it. I have mine set up for it to turn on the main display with a tap of the screen or the crown.4) This watch has such supurb battery life (In the month or so that I\'ve had it, I would need to plug it in probably every third day or so with normal use. Normal use is a tracked workout every other day or so and just wearing it and tracking sleep.  Since it has such a great battery life, it allows you to wear the watch while sleep and it records your sleep quality... How much time spent aware, in REM, light and deep sleep... It tracks breathing rate, skin temperature, pulse rate, blood oxygen.  For good sleep it tracks the amount of sleep and when you go to sleep and when you wake.  Consistency in these makes for healthier sleep overall.  Great info to help me make better decisions for my health for me and my family.5) Both screens are visible in full sunlight.  It has adaptive brightness similar to your phone.6) It plays music via bluetooth earbuds.  Unfortuantely, and I think this has more to do with Wear OS, it cannot play music via it\'s onboard speakers.  Youtube Music, spotify, amazon music work well on it.  There is storage on board to download music tracks from your favorite music source with the necessary subscriptions I\'m sure. This allows you to play music on a run so you can truly unplug from your phone.7) Notifications from phone apps are more fluid and smooth. Dismissing them is as easy as a swipe as they should be.8) Taking phone calls on this watch is much improved over the TWP3, it takes the call everytime whereas in the TWP3, sometimes when answering a call on the watch it just answer the call and then make it find my phone to have the conversation.  The voice quality is clear on both ends.  Since this is not an LTE version (which I don\'t know if one will be made), I obviously need to have a Bluetooth connection with my phone active for phone calls to work.9) The included apps are helpful. The Tic series of apps are highly focused on health... physical and mental.  I don\'t use them much. The incorporated use of pulse, blood oxygen are shown on one of the default watch faces which is SUPER helpful for generally tracking my vitals. Speaking of which...', 'So many reviews have given you stats that you can find on Mobvoi site.  I have several Ticwatches as I was first turned on to this brand because it ran Google Wear.  I work in a Google world and having a watch synchronized with my world was a huge bonus.  I also have a Samsung watch.My usage is for fitness and work.  And the Ticwatch has a good functional interface that can take you from your morning workout to the office.Here is my user experience over the last 4 days.Compared to the Ticwatch 3 this is a faster and smoother operating watch.  Battery life is excellent.  At full capacity after 3 days the battery was at 57% after using it for daily exercise and sleep tracking. After 4 days it was at 38%.  As it is summer and work is slow, I did not receive a lot of text messages or phone calls but I can’t imagine the additional strain draining the battery that much.I have categorized my thoughts into 3 categories: Good, Neutral and Not digging this.  Keep in mind that I have all the sensors on and am monitoring sleep.Good:- Ticwatch 5’s case is the same size as Ticwatch 3’s.- Where you get the increase in size is the watch face.  It is easier to read and the with the ability to increase the font size, the largest font on the 5 is larger than the largest font on the 3.- It’s a good looking watch.  The new clean bezel around the face is much more mature and gender neutral.- Set-up was easy-peasy.  It was probably less 10 minutes, closer to 5 min.- The pulldown menu from the watch face screen had more shortcuts than past Ticwatches.  It now contains the button to clean water from you speaker and Google wallet among others.  Shortcuts that are fast and easy to get to are always appreciated.- Charging is LIGHTNING fast!  Mobvoi says 30 minute for a full charge but I think it might be faster.- Sitting overnight off of my wrist it only lost 6%.  If I were travelling and needed to conserve I would either put it on Airplane mode or into Essential Mode.- New Google Maps is great! It’s a miniature of the Google maps app on your phone.  Complete with navigation and satellite view.- The watch updates in the background so that you can continue to use the apps during updates.  To check if the watch is updating, swipe up on the watch face. It will do numerous updates for the first day but you will not notice them.  The watch functions seamlessly.Neutral:- The rotating crown is new and I was not impressed.  To rotate the crown you use the same “swipe style” motion with the index finger as you would use if you were swiping the watch face.  If you used the entire length of your finger you could probably get through the whole menu but that is just pushing an experience for the sake of something new.  I was excited to try this out as I thought it would be a much better experience.- This is a 2 button watch, a rotating crown and a flat button.  I wish you could customize the flat button to a favorite.  The flat button:  Press it once and it is set to “recently used”.  Press it 2 times and it opens Google Wallet.  I wish these were reversed.  The crown:  Rotate the crown on the main Essential Mode screen and it runs through Tichealth, runs your vital signs and compass.- Workout choices.  Mobvoi just launched their treadmill, which I really want because I could pair my watch with the treadmill.  Because of this there is no treadmill workout option.  “Indoor Running” is the option for off brand treadmill use.  I think it’s frustrating and misleading.  I think Ticwatch treadmill users would understand that you choose Mobvoi Treadmill when using the treadmill.  Keep in mind this is mentioned in the “Neutral” category, not a deal breaker.Not digging this:- No Google assistant!  I relied heavily on my Google assistant on my Ticwatch 3.  The good news is that there is still a voice command for locating apps on the watch and for responding to texts.  Me thinks it was a money saving choice to leave it off.- There is another Mobvoi health app to download.  I now have 4 Mobvoi apps on my phone for various Mobvoi watches.  This one looks like the old version except it has a great new sleep feature.  In the sleep activity there is a button that says “starts sleep”  Push and go to bed.  When you wake up you open the app and long press the button to stop your sleep activity.  Shortly after the statistics show up on your phone.  I use a cpap that monitors me and the sleep app seemed pretty accurate.- Sleep tracker was off on the 3rd day.  It said I had only slept 4hrs 51 min. When I had slept over 8hrs.- Wear OS and the Mobvoi Health apps are still a little glitchy.  It took a few trys to pair the Wear app and even when paired you cannot see the image of the watch like you do with the other Ticwatch versions nor can you see all of your watch faces.  Now that I have paired with the Wear OS app the Tichealth app won’t pair, yet all of my statistics are on the Tichealth app and are being updated in real time.  It’s frustration when things don’t work as they should.- Lack of aftermarket watchband choices.  This uses a 24mm watchband and there are so few choices.  As I mentioned the case of the Pro 5 is the same size as the Pro 3.  What they have done is widened the opening for the band by 2mm to allow the band to taper down to 22mm.  This really gives a more premium look to the watch but makes it hard to find a replacement band.  Mobvoi sells 2 other colors on their website.  If you like the colors and the style of the band that might not be a negative for you.Conclusion:Often when I get a new product in a series, the new version does not live up to expectation.  The new Pro 5 is great upgrade from the Ticwatch Pro 3.  There are some minor hiccups that need to be corrected in the phone app but overall things just seem to work better on this version, more like a computer on your wrist on not a simple fitness tracker.  Plus, I love the new long lasting battery that will get me through a weekend excursion without having to take along a charging cable.  I went 4 days and was down to 38% battery life!', ""My last watch was the Mobvoi Ticwatch Pro 3 that I have had since Oct 2020.  It still works and I have had no problems with it but the new one, the Pro 5, caught my eye and after a couple of weeks and as many reviews I could find I purchased it.  Pricey?  Yeah a little bit but so far worth it, in my opinion.  I am a 69 year old guy, retired, who does not use most of the extended exercise routines included with it but the Pro 5 is much more refined than the Pro 3 as you would expect.  It is the little things that have made a difference for me so far.  It arrived on 8 Jun 2023 and the first 24 hours the drain on the battery was a lot but this is because I was checking everything on the watch and there is plenty to learn and figure out how to apply to your needs and wants.  Weight wise on the wrist I have not noticed any difference from the Pro 3.  I replaced the included band with a stainless steel one because it suits me better.  There are more details on the Ultra Low Power (ULP) screen than before which I have found helpful.  You can also check a few other things from that screen so that helps with power usage.  The watch face is slightly bigger which allows both watch faces to display more information.  I like the Android 11/Wear OS 3.5 that is included.  The Pro 3 had Android 9/Wear OS 2.42.  The layout is different with the Pro 5 and to me seems less cluttered than the Pro 3 and you don't have to hunt as much to get to a feature.  The rolling crown is a nice touch. It is fast and responsive just as the Pro 3 was when I first got it.  If I had any complains or wants or wishes, it would be nice to be able to change/add tones for the alarm, same with the ringtones.  The ones included are not really appealing to me but they work. None of these are necessary changes but it would ne nice.  My first digital watches were Mobvoi back in their infancy and were affordable for me at the time.  So I have seen the company excel and progress over several years.  The one-tap measurement (heart rate, blood oxygen, respiratory rate, stress and overall heart health) can be done in approx 90 seconds for a quick look at everything.  Very nice feature!  No Google Assistant but I have never got into it talking to inanimate objects.  Now the big thing, the battery!  My test started with a full battery at 1330 (1:30pm) on 9 Jun 2023.  It is now 1630 (4:30pm) on 12 Jun 2023 and I am at 50%.  75 hours if my old school math of fingers and toes is correct.  Not bad but I am sure that will adjust down and up depending how busy I might be as it would for anyone else.  Keep in mind I am not out much and not running around all day either like most people are and if I was there would be some more power use.  I was getting about 30 to 36 hours on my Pro 3 when I set it aside and 24 hours while I was still working.  Not bad either for a 2020 watch tech. Essential mode when sleeping is bound to help with battery life too.  It measures the essentials while sleeping and you can set the start and stop time.  GPS accurate within feet and the compass feature is good also.  Health monitoring features have been refined and are more accurate in my opinion.  Plenty of exercise options available in many forms.  Is this the watch for you?  Only you can make that decision but this has a lot of features others currently don't have along with latest Snapdragon 5+ Gen 1 chip which helps things along including a slightly larger battery than the Pro 3.  Like any other Tech you are interested in, no matter what you get a better version will come long later on.  Is it worth the price?  I think it is.  Mine came out of the box with a watch face called Color Run and I like it as it displays a lot of information and surprisingly it is readable even to an older guy like me that needs glasses to read.  I am an old school guy who got into the computer revolution in the beginning, early 1970's.  In 50 years we have come a long way, some good, some bad, but this watch is something else as far as wearable tech goes.  A lot worry about making a fashions statement, I want something that works good and is durable, like this watch is.  Like I said at the beginning, it is still early but I am impressed.  Definitely recommend!Update: 13 June 2023 - 1330 (1:30pm) - At the 96 hour mark there was still 37% listed for the battery.  Once again, I am an older guy who is not as active as he used to be so there is a good possibility that a more active person wearing this watch will not get quite these types of results but it should still be very good.  It took 50 minutes to go from 37% to fully charged.  Not bad but then again it is new and hasn't been cycled many times yet.  Based on the cycling life of other rechargeable products I am sure things will drop down some percentage points and extended time limits to charge but will still be impressive by today's standards.  This is a remarkable watch with a lot of features not currently available on other watches I have researched and all in one package.  Yes it is pricey compared to other watches but....it all depends on what you want one for and your particular needs, and of course your wallet.  And it is just a durable as the Pro 3 is meaning you don't have to be overly careful.  Even though I will probably never use even half of the features this watch has available, I am still glad I got it!Update 17 June 2023:  91 hours this time, 40% battery left.  The past few days I have been busier than usual and watch did its job as you would expect and hope.  Accurate readings, etc.  Charged early because of a long day ahead and didn't want to risk it getting out of juice even though I probably wouldn't.  Just more cautious in my old age I guess. 55 minutes from 40% to 100%.  So far this watch has more than lived up to the standards it advertises and I have no doubt it will continue to do so."", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Il nuovo TicWatch Pro 5 mi ha convinto. Fino a poco tempo fa utilizzavo il Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 LTE, che è già davvero ottimo. In precedenza, avevo già utilizzato il Ticwatch Pro 3. Tuttavia, la durata della batteria di entrambi non è eccezionale. Tuttavia, la durata della batteria di entrambi non è eccezionale.Negativo: ho notato i seguenti punti negativi. Il braccialetto in dotazione sembra purtroppo un po\' ""economico"" - purtroppo la sostituzione del braccialetto è più difficile rispetto al TICWATCH Pro 3, poiché il TICWATCH Pro 5 richiede ora un braccialetto da 24 mm. Purtroppo, non c\'è la stessa scelta di questa misura rispetto alla versione da 22 mm. Il problema maggiore per me è l\'assenza di Google Assistant. Questo è sempre stato un criterio importante per me quando ho scelto uno smartwatch con Wear OS. Spero che questo aspetto venga presto migliorato! Per me è sicuramente una detrazione di una stella.Positivo:La qualità visiva e aptica è molto buona. Il comfort di utilizzo è buono, a parte il cinturino in dotazione. Opterò per un braccialetto alternativo.La configurazione e l\'aggiornamento del firmware sono stati rapidi. Niente contro Samsung, ma WearOS di Mobvoi sembra un po\' più valido. Quando si riceve un messaggio, è possibile rispondere direttamente. È possibile rispondere con suggerimenti di testo, smiley, il proprio testo tramite la tastiera o l\'input vocale..... Oppure si può semplicemente cancellare o archiviare il messaggio. Proprio come su uno smartphone.Un\'altra grande caratteristica è la possibilità di visualizzare l\'intero messaggio, comprese le foto, direttamente sullo Smartwatch.Con il TicWatch con WearOS, ho installato l\'app FEEL THE WEAR e posso usare l\'app per impostare la frequenza e la durata della vibrazione dell\'orologio quando ricevo un messaggio. In questo modo posso anche capire dalla vibrazione di che tipo di messaggio si tratta.Samsung ha fatto passi da gigante per quanto riguarda le watchfaces, ma con WearOS e l\'app WatchMaker, ad esempio, sono infinite le watchfaces che si possono personalizzare in base ai propri gusti e preferenze.Il nuovo processore W5+Gen1 ha finora mantenuto le promesse. Il menu e la gestione sono molto ""fluidi"" e non ci sono scatti o simili. Inoltre, la batteria dura circa 5 giorni. Finora, si tratta di un valore di punta per uno smartwatch con Wear OS. E se si può fare a meno di alcune funzioni, la durata della batteria può essere prolungata di parecchio.Monitoraggio del sonno: molto buono, funziona davvero bene.Misurazione della frequenza cardiaca 24 ore su 24: ottima come la concorrenza.Tutte le altre innumerevoli funzioni sono ben studiate e hanno senso.Il contapassi potrebbe essere un po\' migliore. Purtroppo non ho ancora trovato il modo di impostare la mia lunghezza di passo personale.La velocità dell\'orologio è fantastica. Nessun sobbalzo, nessun ritardo inspiegabile!Apprezzo anche la possibilità di utilizzare Google Fit o qualsiasi altra app per il fitness presente nel Playstore e di non doversi affidare alle app predefinite.Un altro aspetto che vorrei menzionare è il cavo di ricarica. Purtroppo si tratta di un cavo/adattatore speciale e solo questo può essere utilizzato. Tuttavia, la funzione magnetica, utilizzata anche da altri produttori, è positiva: basta avvicinare l\'orologio all\'adattatore e questo viene ""tirato"" al posto giusto.Anche dal punto di vista visivo lo smartwatch ha fatto un salto di qualità rispetto al TICWATCH Pro 3 (vedi foto di confronto).Conclusione: un ottimo smartwatch. Per me è attualmente il miglior smartwatch con il sistema operativo WEAR di Google. Anche il rapporto qualità-prezzo è giusto!', ""Having used a Ticwatch Pro 3 GPS prior to getting this watch, this is a serious upgrade that has really impressed me. Wear OS 3 runs so smoothly on this device, and the rotating crown is a great upgrade that I didn't realise I wanted so much! Navigation, battery, sports tracking, have all worked seamlessly in my last week or so of testing. Some of the big things which I consider to be game changing updates:Battery Life: I have consistently got around 3 days of battery life from this watch. I generally just charge it when in the shower which is generally enough to keep it topped up, but did push it a couple of times to see how it performed. I had 24hr heart rate tracking enable, and had the automatic switch to essential mode enabled for around 6 hours each night.Automatic Switch to Essential Mode: I never had this enabled on my TWP3 because I always felt that switching between smartwatch mode and essential mode was a bit tedious, and not very seamless. This has been completely resolved. When I wake up and wake the watch for the first time, the switch back to smartwatch mode takes around 5 seconds, It's really impressive!5 Atmosphere Water Resistance: After reading about so many people bricking their TWP3 by wearing in the shower (not recommended!) it's great to see that Mobvoi has taken the desire for better waterproofing seriously. 5 Atmosphere water resistance places this watch in league with some great higher end sports watches!Altimeter: This may seem like a small thing, but as an avid hiker, I always found the altimeter on my TWP3 was consistently innacurate by around 150m. The new barometer app on this watch works SO much better than previously. Not only does it use barometric altitude + GPS, but it also includes the ability to CALIBRATE. Something that I desperately wanted from my TWP3! So if you're standing on a spot height which you know the exact altitude for, you can calibrate the altimeter there and then to ensure further accuracy in the future which is fantastic!Sports Tracking: Generally, I didn't have too many issues with sports tracking on my TWP3 however I did occasionally run into crashing and syncing issues, especially on longer activities like hikes (5+ hours easily). While I admit I haven't extensively tested for these, I haven't run into any of the same issues I had previously. All of my activities have synced near instantly with my phone and I haven't run into any crashes as of yet.Better 2nd LCD screen: The rotating crown enables the 2nd power saving screen to be so much more useful than on the TWP3 which is great. There are a multitude of different screens now available to cycle through using the rotating crown. Some customisability of these screens would be a fantastic additional feature as I don't think I've found any way to do it yet!All in all, a really great upgrade, I can't speak for the watches between the TWP3 and this, but if you're currently enjoying a TWP3 I can definitely say this upgrade is worth it. The wealth of new features is very welcome and the experience of Wear OS 3 is great. I do wish that Mobvoi would bring Wear OS 3 to the TWP3 asap as they promised what feels like years ago. Everyone deserves to experience this new software!I also have a Garmin EPIX Gen 2 which is my daily driver. At more than double the price of this watch it feels unfair to make any kind of direct comparison, however there are a few things that the Garmin does which could be implemented by Mobvoi on this watch to make the entire experience considerably better:Customisability: On my Garmin, you can customise every aspect of every piece of sports tracking. This is a HUGE quality of life increase for any avid runner, cyclist, hiker, or general sportsperson. The ability to change the sports tracking screens to show the exact information I desire is such a powerful tool, and one that Mobvoi should really look to implement. In the first instance, this would be great for the actual TicExercise app, and not necessarily the LCD screen features, but to expand this to the LCD screen would be an amazing update too.Better health metrics: Heart rate variability is an incredibly powerful health metric tracked on Garmin, which I find is really useful for catching illness early, determining my sleep quality, and generally measuring my overall stress. With 24h HR monitoring this would be a fantastic thing for Mobvoi to add into the watch.Estimated Battery Life: When starting a sports activity, garmin estimate the battery life you have left on the watch. This is especially useful for determining whether I need to charge the watch prior to my activity or not. Garmin's estimations take into account the GPS settings and whether you are listening to music via the watch, which is super useful. This would be something I would hugely appreciate Mobvoi adding, as if I know I am going for a 1 hour run, I can know how important it is to charge the device before doing so.Downloadable GPX files: I believe the Mobvoi may have made this possible through a web browser, however when I tried to use it in the past I could not get it to function as I wanted it to. I often ran into Strava sync issues on my TWP3 in the past, which then left me stuck as I couldn't get hold of the GPX file of my activity in the Mobvoi app. This would be a HUGE quality of life improvement that Mobvoi could add to their health app, as I wouldn't feel scared about running into sync issues as I could just do a manual GPX upload to Strava.Dedicated Sync Watch button: In addition to the above, I would often run into issues on my TWP3 where an activity would be on the watch but refusing to sync to the app. Granted I haven't run into this on this watch during my testing, but having a dedicated sync watch button in the Mobvoi health app could really help to alleviate the issue. As rather than having to wait for my phone and watch to sync when they want, I could force the two to check files and sync whenever I wanted.All in all, a fantastic watch. Mobvoi could definitely learn a thing or two from the more dedicated Sportswatch providers about how to improve quality of life around sports and health tracking, but that doesn't warrant me removing a star. I can easily recommend this watch to anyone wanting a really reliable, smooth and fast, all round great smartwatch."", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Confesso di essere un amante di orologi, sia analogici che digitali, questi ultimi da quando mi è stato regalato, parecchi anni fa un bellissimo e ancora perfettamente funzionante “LG G Watch R”, penso fosse il primo con lo schermo “circolare” e Google Wear OS e da quel momento ho iniziato ad apprezzarli sempre di più e a tenermi aggiornato sui nuovi modelli.Ho diversi smartwatch che uso con regolarità.Il marchio MobVoi l\'ho conosciuto quando ho acquistato uno dei primi modelli proposti da questa casa, uno semplicissimo TicWatch E1 (che dopo 4 anni di vita funziona ancora alla grande) e vista l\'ottima impressione diversi anni fa ho regalato ad un amico il primo (penso) TicWatch, versione PRO, che mi aveva colpito per la sensazione di robustezza, decisamente inattesa per un prodotto distribuito da un marchio che a quei tempi non era proprio conosciuto.Da quel momento non ne ho perso neanche uno... infatti ho preso il TicWatch PRO 2020, poi il TicWatch PRO 3 LTE, poi il modello PRO 3 Ultra GPS (che uso tutti i giorni) e adesso, visto che amo le novità mi sono appena regalato la versione PRO 5.Le motivazioni che mi hanno spinto ad acquistarlo non risiedono tanto nella necessità di averne uno, quanto nella voglia di provare qualcosa di nuovo e conoscendo bene il marchio MobVoi sono andato a colpo sicuro!A differenza dei detrattori di Wear OS, ritengo che Google abbia raggiunto un ottimo livello, sia in termini di usabilità sia in termini di applicazioni ed il fatto di avere su tutti gli smartwatch lo stesso sistema operativo lo trovo particolarmente comodo, in questo modo mi ritrovo su tutti gli orologi le stesse cose, le stesse applicazioni e lo stesso modo di funzionare, senza contare che non devo installare altre applicazioni, visto che basta quella standard di Google Wear OS.A parte questa, spero utile premessa, parto con la recensione di questo nuovo modello.La confezione è ben realizzata, anzi a dire il vero ogni prodotto MobVoi viene venduto con una confezione ben studiata (anche per il primissimo modello E1) e molto bella visivamente.La scatola, di colore bianco, contiene al suo interno lo smartwatch, il cavo di alimentazione con aggancio magnetico (manca anche qui l’alimentatore) ed un piccolo manuale di istruzioni (anche in italiano)La qualità dello smartwatch è notevole, partendo dal cinturino in gomma (anche se meno pregiato del modello adottato sulla versione LTE). Il cinturino è un modello standard da 22 mm con aggancio rapido tramite clip a molla. L’insieme è molto gradevole e sembra ancora più robusto della versione ""PRO 3 Ultra"", anche se forse avrei preferito un meccanismo di chiusura più evoluto in luogo della classica fibbia, ma a quanto pare MobVoi da questo punto di vista non ci sente...Va detto che comunque è possibile sostituire il cinturino con altri modelli compatibili e risolvere il problema con pochi euro in più.Proseguendo, balza subito all’occhio lo schermo, decisamente grande e ben leggibile, anche in condizioni di luce intensa. La particolarità di questo modello (esattamente come per le versioni PRO precedenti) è la presenza di due display sovrapposti, uno AMOLED a colori ed uno LCD il tutto protetto da un vetro con trattamento antigraffio, sicuramente non paragonabile al vetro zaffiro utilizzato sui modelli di fascia alta ma comunque in grado di assicurare una buona protezione.Quando l’orologio non è utilizzato, il sistema disattiva lo schermo a colori ed attiva la versione LCD monocromatica che visualizza l’ora, la data, il numero di passi, lo stato della batteria, i battiti rilevati, ecc.. consumando però pochissima energia a tutto vantaggio della durata della batteria. La novità, rispetto alle versioni precedenti consiste nella presenza di una corona ""ruotabile"", una retroilluminazione RGB (selezionabile tra un lungo elenco di colori possibili) del display LCD (quello normalmente attivo per risparmiare sulla batteria) che si attiva automaticamente al movimento del polso rendendo molto più facile leggere il contenuto in caso di illuminazione scarsa e l\'aggiunta di alcuni nuovi sensori, come quello barometrico e la bussola.Il display AMOLED è veramente impressionante, sia per la qualità dei colori che per il contrasto, senza trascurare la risoluzione molto alta che consente di rappresentare quadranti “quasi reali”.La scelta del quadrante da visualizzare può essere fatta direttamente dall’orologio (o anche dallo smartphone tramite l’applicazione Wear OS) selezionandolo tra uno dei tanti proposti da MobVoi o in alternativa installando applicazioni di terze parti, anche gratuite, in grado di simulare praticamente qualsiasi tipo di orologio esistente al mondo, penso che Wear OS ad oggi offra il maggior numero di sfondi o applicazioni al mondo.L’orologio presenta un singolo pulsante (che funziona sia per l\'accensione che per l\'apertura delle ultime app utilizzate) e la già citata corona ruotabile che funge sia da pulsante che da rotella di scorrimento, una funzionalità non nuova nel mondo degli smartwatch ma di solito riservata a modelli di brand più importanti (come ad esempio il MontBlanc Summit 2).Per quanto riguarda le altre caratteristiche hardware, questo smartwatch integra in particolare:1) 2 GB di memoria RAM e ben 32 GB di memoria di storage;2) Display LCD e AMOLED da 1,43 pollici;3) un sensore per la lettura del battito cardiaco (anche continuo) e tramite l’app Tic Salute o TicBattito è possibile monitorare i battiti e le anomalie H24, evidenziandole in appositi riquadri;4) Sensore NFC utilizzabile con GooglePay per pagare con carta di credito direttamente dallo smartwatch (veramente comodo);5) Sensore GPS (per tutte le applicazioni che lo richiedono) compatibile con GPS, GLONASS, Beidou, Galileo e QZSS;6) Un sensore per il controllo della saturazione dell’ossigeno (molto in voga in questo periodo di post Covid-19);7) Barometro e Bussola;8) In ultimo, il nuovissimo processore Snapdragon W5+ Gen 1 molto più performante e parco nei consumi dei modelli attualmente sul mercato (WEAR 4100 compreso).Oltre a questi c’è il contapassi e contacalorie, accelerometro, giroscopio, sensore luce (già presenti nella versione precedente) a cui si aggiungono le funzionalità per il monitoraggio dello stress, del sonno, del rumore, ecc..Gli argomenti “Batteria” e “Durata” sono difficili da definire perché troppo influenzati dalla tipologia di utilizzo, dopo 2 giorni di utilizzo intenso il consumo della batteria è sceso al 60% (ma ci ho giocato davvero tanto) per cui direi che è assolutamente identico al modello PRO 3 Ultra che utilizzo da quasi 1 anno.Certo questo non vuole essere un test rigoroso, ma dovrebbe dare l’idea del bassissimo consumo del display LCD monocromatico e del nuovo processore Qualcomm SnapDragon W5+.L’aspetto software è praticamente identico a tutti gli altri smartwatch con lo stesso sistema operativo e questo lo trovo fantastico, il mondo delle app sviluppate per il mondo Google Wear è praticamente infinito… si trova di tutto, personalmente ho installato su tutti i mie smartwatch Spotify (cosi da poter comandare la musica direttamente dall’orologio), WhatsApp, SkiTrack e tanti altri…L’insieme delle applicazioni preinstallate da TicWatch è decisamente completo e tutte orientate al monitoraggio della salute in tutti gli ambiti possibili. Tra le più importanti troviamo: TicSalute, TicEsercizio, TicBattico, TicSonno, TicRespiro, TicZen, TicOssigeno,TicAscolto, VoiceMemo.Va sottolineato che questo modello presenta ben 2GB di memoria RAM (quella utilizzata per far girare i programmi) e 32 GB di memoria ROM ed in effetti si sente la presenza, i programmi funzionano più velocemente rispetto ad altri smartwatch che invece hanno 512MB o al massimo 1GB di memoria.In definitiva, pur avendo smartwatch nella mia collezione anche Smartwatch di marchi blasonati alla fine quelli che uso tutti i giorni sono i modelli di MobVoi che ritengo essere tra i migliore smartwatch Google Wear presenti sul mercato.PRO- Design moderno- Leggerezza- Memoria RAM da 2GB- Memoria ROM da 32GB- Processore Qualcomm SnapDragon W5+ Gen 1- Doppio display (con retroilluminazione a colori)- Durata della batteria- Cinturino da 22mm- Manuale in italianoCONTRO- Per il momento nulla da segnalareSpero che questa recensione vi sia stata utile.', 'I purchased the TicWatch Pro 5 off the back of already owning the TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra GPS, and the TicWatch Pro 2020 before that. Both the previous 2 models were superb, so as soon as the TicWatch Pro 5 came out, I knew I wanted one!  I have been using it for about a week and the long and short of it is, I love it!PackagingDifferent to the previous models, this watch comes in a long thin box allowing the watch to sit flat during transport.  The box itself feels high-quality, and contains the watch, instructions, and charger, all packaged with care to ensure a flawless product on delivery.Watch DesignAs expected, this iteration of the Ticwatch Pro series is stunning. The older Pro 3 Ultra was very good looking, but this Pro 5 version excels with additions such as the knurled bezel and almost flush glass, which is Gorilla Glass in this version – very handy and rugged, and also has an anti-fingerprint coating. The materials of the watch feel very durable, which you would expect from the MIL-STD-810H Military Standard specification.  It is also rated for up to 5ATM Open Water Swim.The side buttons both feel robust and are unobtrusive even when bending the wrist (if you wear it on your left wrist like I do, some watch buttons can get pressed when bending the wrist).  The main crown button rotates which is useful when in the watch OS for scrolling through apps or settings. The crown button also has a very attractive red inlay.  The other button is nearly flush to the body, and has a grippy texture.The watch is a few mm thicker and a couple of grams heavier than the older Pro 3 Ultra model, but does not feel oversized and is still lightweight.StrapThe supplied strap is quoted as a 24mm band, which it is at it’s widest point near the body but the strap itself is 22mm wide The black silicone strap is quick-release and is incredibly soft to the touch. It has a decent amount of flex, without feeling floppy, and at the same time it feels very durable.DisplayThis is where the Ticwatch really shines. Using the clever 1.43” dual display, the majority of the time the watch will be using the low-power always-on LCD screen. This screen shows the essential information like Time, Date, Step count, Heart Rate, NFC, Bluetooth connection and battery. By either clicking a button, touching the screen, or tilting your wrist, this activates the OLED display which then allows the full smart watch functionality, with responsive touch screen and a host of apps at your disposal.The LCD display is great for viewing in light areas, and is perfectly readable in direct sunlight, which a lot of smart watches cannot do.  The LCD can utilise a coloured backlight mode, which is a nice addition.The full OLED display is bright and vibrant with excellent viewing angles and dark blacks at a resolution of 466x466 (326ppi).AppsRunning on Wear OS3, most of the apps are fairly standard. All the regulars are there like Phone, Memo, Calc, Alarm, Stopwatch/Timer, Weather etc. With the benefit of access to the Google Play store to download thousands of other apps.My most used apps such as Google Keep, Strava, Spotify all worked flawlessly.Another big plus is Google Pay, which is fully supported on this watch, I have made numerous purchases using it, as it is SO convenient. In case you’re worried about security, if using Google Pay you must set up a PIN or pattern, which activates every time you put on the watch. Therefore, if the watch was taken from you, Google Pay would not function without it.In terms of the Tic built in apps:I have TicSleep monitoring my sleep, as the watch is comfortable enough to wear to bedTicZen and TicBreath can help de-stressTicHearing can be used to measure the volume of an areaTicPulse is used to monitor my heart rate, which I have set to do 24/7 monitoring. Accuracy seems consistent with the previous models.TicOxygen measures blood oxygen levels. I also have this running 24/7.TicExercise has all the modes you would expect from an exercise tracking app – Run, Walk, Treadmill, Cycling, Freestyle, and many more including Swimming due to the IP68 water resistant rating. It can also upload to Strava, which is my exercise hub of choice.A new addition to the Tic apps is TicBarometer, which includes an Altimeter and Compass and can be set to monitor continuously.All of this gets pulled into the TicHealth app which gives a nice overview of all the above functions.TouchScreen and HardwareThe screen is responsive to touch, I would say more responsive than the previous models. The watch is the first to utilise the Qualcomm Snapdragon W5+ Gen 1 chipset, which is a powerful applications processor and ultra-low power co-processor, performs admirably and combined with the 2GB RAM and the increased 32GB ROM it never seems to slow down or show any signs of lagging.The usual connectivity that you’d expect such as Bluetooth 5.2 and Wireless, and a whole host of GNSS technology (GPS+Beidou+Glonass+Galileo+QZSS)Battery LifeThis is where the watch really stands out for me, after using it for a week I have only charged it once.  This is a massive improvement over the previous models. Taking in to account that I was using the watch with so many features running, such as the 24/7 heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, and also wearing it to monitor sleep. From first charge, I was able to easily get 4 days, including 3 nights sleep monitoring, and still had about 30% battery left.  I have the watch set to automatically enter essentials mode during the night - which shuts down most smart functions, limits you to the LCD screen.  When I did charge the watch, it charged quicklyUIThe UI on this feels buttery smooth, with no lag that I can detect. All touches are recognised, and no delays between presses and apps opening.  Notifications show quickly and reliably, and the vibration is defined and strong.ChargingThe watch includes a discreet magnetic charging clip. It clicks into place effortlessly and allows the watch to sit at a slight angle, which would be nice for a bedside if you’re not wearing it to bed along with TicSleep.ConclusionSo in conclusion, this is a superb and very comfortable smartwatch that I can see myself wearing for years to come…Or at least until the next model comes out!']"

For one I scratched the crystal on a concrete bench, pretty sure it scraped some quartz and well the hardness of quartz means it\'ll scratch a watch crystal. I\'ll see if a jeweler can buff it out.A note on some of my complaints. The app is okay, but not amazing and the watch itself only syncs to the app when you open the app, it won\'t sync in the background (this issue might be exclusive to Android). This may be a deal breaker for most as it\'s frustrating that you can\'t ever trust your watch to sync but I found a hack someone released in like 2018 that is basically just a better app in every way to the original including a function that allows it to sync every time you unlock your phone. I\'m a big fan of easy community solutions to shitty corporate decisions so if anything it made me like the watch more.Definitely be wary that installing a random unverified apk onto your android phone is considered unsafe but in my opinion worth it because now my watch syncs properly and the new hacked app has better functionality. (if you want the hacked app for your android phone you can look it up, it\'s made by coronafire and I found it through some random reddit post.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Whelp, I got the watch around noon Aug 1 and it\'s 7pm Aug 19 and have finally gotten to 12% battery life. Now there\'s a couple things to note. Namely, that I don\'t wear it while I sleep. Otherwise I use it to track my walks, I look at the heart-rate graph at the end of the day and I only have some minor complaints.Pros: Looks fantastic, works exactly as expected. Battery life is phenomenal. Watch face is very easy to see in daylight compared to backlit screens. That\'s what you get with an e-ink display. On top of that you can customize the background to whatever you want and place different information points wherever you like.Cons: E-ink is a little slow to respond, for me not a huge deal, but if you like things snappy, you\'re not getting it with this display. It occasionally spends time unsynced from my phone, I note this because the weather occasionally doesn\'t display on the screen. Another downside is that the heart rate chart doesn\'t show exact values, and you can\'t output it either. Best you get is a max/min/avg heartrate and you kinda just have to guess the rest from the graph. Not the end of the world, but it sucks you can\'t get exact values from throughout the day. Other reviewers say they\'ve seen condensation in their watch. I\'m not a shower/sleep with my watch kinda guy, I tend not to just dunk watches in water or expose them to extreme circumstances, especially when they look this good and professional. Idk if it\'s quality control or whatever, but if you plan to treat this like a rugged watch, do this watch and yourself a favor and just get something meant for that. Sure marketing says 3atm of water resistance, but if you know watches you know anything under 5atm is basically not waterproof so don\'t get upset about it, marketing is just that, and while I believe companies should be honest I know we live in the real world and they\'re going to lie to us no matter what so understand that you\'re not going diving and you shouldn\'t shower wearing a $150 hybrid watch from Fossil.Side Note: Other reviews have said it doesn\'t come with instructions. It does, they\'re just kinda wedged in the box, just gotta look a little, they\'ve got a big ""FOSSIL"" printed on the cover I\'m pretty sure.Overall I love it, I did a lot of research and for me having a watch I can wear for 18 days without worrying about battery, but still getting little buzz\'s for notifications and still seeing steps and weather and the date all conveniently there how I want it. Truly enjoy this, it looks very professional and has a premium feel.', ""Presentation-Not a green on green background which is very disappointing, it is a black dial with a green ring, which is fine, but not all green as advertised in the pictures. Probably the biggest thing to note, it won't look like the pictures at all becuase of that.-After some researching I found out that there were two lines of this watch from Fossil one with a green background which was discontinued, and one with this black backgroundFeel-Buttons are a bit hard/painful to press but one gets used to it.-Vibrations are good for notifications, but don't trust it to wake you up for alarms- Otherwise feels great-Band feels really niceWatch UI-A bit clunky but you get shortcuts, unfortunately they updated the apps and went from 3 shortcuts to 2, which was again, disappointing-sleep tracking does not work unless you have the watch very very tightly and high on your wrist-Weather app has an issue of disconnecting, displays nothing, or gives wrong info, very annoying but seems to happen for a few ahour at a time then resolve itself-Watch may disconnect a fair bit from phone-Music controls are decent, though I wish they could be customized-Still, simple features, some getting used to, but good overallApp UI-A nightmare and regrettable, you'll need to watch some tutorials of which there aren't many with this new interface. It's really bad-Almost returned the watch because of the app-It's a learning curve, and the UI is terrible but after you get the hang of it, it's okay and you have some fair amount of customizationOverall still a beautiful watch, great for a classic look and with some smart functionality also a great battery life"", ""UPDATE: Officially dead and unable to charge 9/13/2023 (16 months after purchase). Battery seemed to have degraded very little. Metal contacts on backside of watch appear to have worn away.My opinion of this watch was entirely positive for about the first 8 months or so. I have developed a few complaints in the 15 months I've now had it, however. I wish it lasted longer.The first issue I ran into was an update for the Fossil app that broke the screen until they fixed that with the next update. The buttons worked, because the hands still moved in response, but the screen was completely blank, regardless of the face selected. This has thankfully hasn't happened since. Customer support was entirely silent about it, I never got any kind of response.The next issue, not long after, has to do with one of the bands on the strap, the ones that retain the tail end while worn. Weeks after I started wearing the watch, one was noticeably more stretched out than the other (it was also not cut as evenly as the other one), eventually becoming more than double the original diameter. This was the first band to break off. The second one never stretched out, and only ended up breaking off after it had been sliced halfway through by a claw and worn a few months longer still. The stitching held up on both bands, it was the leather that ended up giving out.The middle button has, in recent weeks, quickly become nearly immobile. I cannot see anything that would get in the way, but it feels like there's something in the way preventing it from actuating. I can't really use the menus anymore. This isn't the biggest issue for me, because the display and what it can show at a glance was one of the major selling points for me when I purchased this watch.The last time I charged my watch, it was stuck at 99% and never reached 100% - I had it plugged in for about 12 hours. The battery seems to finally be going. Seeing the same thing again today. The lifespan has been reduced only slightly, I still get close to two weeks between charges.I wear this as a watch primarily, with a few neat features. I'm not a heavy smartwatch user, and haven't explored any of the fitness tracking at all. I will note, however, that this asks if I'm working out basically any time my heart rate is up for more than a minute or two. And then it will ask every five or ten minutes thereafter. I've never answered yes. It's far more obnoxious than the Garmin I had previously worn because of that. But definitely much better looking."", 'Excelente opción como inducción a los Smart; la batería es sin duda el mejor detalle, sin problema dura más de 8 días.Diseño bonito y cómodo de usar.', ""I haven't used it yet but everything is looking fine."", 'As a lover of classic watches, I wanted something classic and smart at the same time. This watch looks simple and classy but does soo much. A single charge takes me about 7days. I am glad I made this purchase.', 'Excelente reloj, me ha servido mucho, me encanta la calidad del producto, se ve muy padre y elegante, además de que sirve Perfecto.', 'amazing quality and so practical. i’ve had an awesome experience using sleep tracking and would absolutely recommend to most everyone. i’ve recommended this to my co workers and so far 3 of them have bought and loved them. the chain of recommendations continues! it has basic controls/features which is just enough to keep track of the essentials. steps heart rate sleep, texts, calls, music control, and few more. love this product, sleek design and catches the eye. absolutely a conversation starter as well. 10 out of 10. Love it!', 'I love the vintage look but the smart functionality in it.', ""I was trying to find the right device for me and I think this is the one.I wanted a good-looking daily wear watch that provided some health tracking features (steps, heart rate, sleeping) after using Fitbit for as long as I can remember.I love the traditional style this watch provides.The screen shows data that I am interested in and I find it easy to read in most settings. With a flick of the wrist, the hands move out of the way. A quick tap on the watch and it lights up in the dark.I have enabled google fit and between the Fossil app and google fit, I can update myfitness pal with my daily metrics.I understand if it's not for everyone but if you want a nice watch with some fitness-tracking benefits, it might be right for you as well.""]"

What I didn't know until I had it in my hands was that it DOES NOT WORK ON TABLETS. To elaborate, it will attempt to sync up, but then every single app (EVERY SINGLE APP) is incompatible with the Tab series. Same Samsung, same Galaxy, nope. I couldn't even use it standalone, any attempt to manually change the date and time was met with another request that I pair to a phone.It's something that Samsung has failed to emphasize before selling you the product; I had to specifically look this issue up to realize it was a pre-existing one across any type of tablet. Smartwatches just don't like tablets, period. If you were like me and thought this would be a good accessory for your Tab, turn back. There's no hope for you. Seems counterproductive that the lightest convenient product would not work with the bulkiest one, but that's Samsung's choice.It seems unfair of me to rate it at all, considering I never actually got to see it in action before returning it to the box. I'm giving it 2 stars because it fails to even work as a digital watch without pairing to a phone."", ""I've been wearing this every day and night for Exactly 6 months now. I do shipping and receiving in a warehouse and take daily walks and go to the gym a few times a week, and I like to be able to track my steps, heartrate, and sleep.Steps: It seems to clock in a bit on the low side, if I count my steps while walking back and forth it might miss a few. I'm personally ok with that, and to keep it more accurate I try not to keep my watch hand stationary (it really fails to count steps if you're pushing a cart, pulling luggage, or just not swinging your arm it seems)Sleep: it's accurate enough to track my overall sleep quantity and patterns (I tend to wake up for a nocturnal wizz every night and it will track that, joys of getting older) however I wouldn't take the sleep quality measurements to heart. I don't have any more expensive products to compare it with myself, but people have compared it with more expensive products and of course they tend to be more accurate.Heartrate: the major downside of this is it can't take your heart rate unless you're standing perfectly still, and it doesn't seem too accurate during workouts (watch said 120, while the treadmill's sensors were showing me 155-165 at the peak of my workout). If you're just going for a run and you stop to take your rate and are careful to hold still it might be accurate, and if you're just checking your resting heart rate I think it's fairly accurate.Other functionalities are all perfect, I love being able to screen messages on my wrist without pulling out my phone, quick reply, change songs, turn off my morning alarm, and quickly check the time and weather.Physically the product is sturdy, I have a few light scratches but it still functions perfectly. It's well designed and fairly attractive for a budget smart watch, I got a few compliments in the first weeks wearing it. I do not have very large wrists/forearms/hands and it doesn't feel bulky or cumbersome. The wrist band is a bit annoying to take on/off but I've learned how to do it quickly (I take it off every night for my shower)Overall for the price and product it's probably a 5 star rating, however I'm leaving it at 4 stars because of minor accuracy problems (you don't want to get this if you're trying to track things for any serious health conditions) and because the battery itself is already at half capacity as when I bought it. I wore this, no joke, for almost 2 weeks straight without needing a charge. Now I can barely get through a week, maybe 3-4 days it will need to be recharged. There hasn't been any changes in my usage, I've been using the exact same features for the last 6 months.Overall a good product, maybe my battery was just bunk, I've seen other people say they use every single feature the watch offers and get a solid 10 days. Maybe I've just been working out more than I realize. Idk, either way I would recommend this as a starter product for people who want to start tracking fitness goals and don't want to spend $200-500 on the fancier products."", 'So I got this today to help me keep track if my heart rate and health functions. I had a galaxy s9+ with a finger sensor and I would check my rate several times during walks and exercise. A few weeks ago I upgraded to the s21 5g. When I first realized the heart rate sensors were gone, I almost sent it back. I was told a fitness band would fill all my needs and let me keep the new phone. Research led me to the Samsung Fit2. Since it\'s a part of the Samsung universe, integration into my life was easy. I charged it and put on a very nice screensaver (available on Amazon) the EZCO 3 pack. Of course I had to play with it a bit and get it the way I seem to like. Then I put it on. I have never had a band that tucked under itself, which kind of scared me a bit. I have never had or used a comfortable watch band. Even as a child I didn\'t wear my Mickey Mouse watch (wish I still had that) because the band bothered me. This has a rubberish type band which is the best designed and most comfortable band I\'ve ever had. I\'ve had it on my wrist for hours now, constant heart rate monitoring, and I\'ve used 1% battery life. Seriously, 2+ hours, constantly playing with it, checking it, wow, just wow. Best $50 I have ever spent on a watch. I love this thingUPDATE: Now I have had this for 2 days and I like it more than I did. Woke up this morning and it was at 88% battery... put it on charge while I took a shower and when I got back, it was at 100% in like 10 minutes, very nice. That was at 8am... now is 10:30 in the evening, about to goto bed, and it is at 94% so I\'m down 6 percent in 14 hours and 30 minutes. Continuous heart rate monitoring, I did turn the brightness down from max to about 20% which was very viewable except in bright sunlight, and I\'m sure that had a major impact on battery life. Love this thingUPDATE #2: Now a few days in and I\'m learning this thing. First, the wake up gesture will drain the battery fastest, even in sleep mode, just moving your wrist will wake it up. There is a little ""home"" button at the bottom middle of the screen, just touch it when you want to see everything. Today is just totally unreal, from 8am (shower time, still haven\'t worked up the nerve to shower with it on, so when I shower I put it on charge) to 8pm... 12 hours, and I am still at 100% battery. I still have it set to continuously check my heart rate, but without the wake up gesture being on, it apparently uses so little battery. My next and hopefully final update will let y\'all know how long I can go between charges, so tomorrow I\'m not charging and we will see how long it goes. I\'ve heard 12 days, and 15 days and so on but I really want to see, and I will report my findings.UPDATE #3: Wow, just amazing. I charged my battery to full at 8am on April 1st, my watch finally died at 5:00pm on April 15th, well over 2 weeks later. You must be aware that the WAKE UP GESTURE is nice and fun and everything, turn it off to save battery. My watch still continuously checks my heart rate or I could have gotten more time from my charge, but this works fantastic. I love this little fitness tracker and I\'m sure y\'all will as well.Big HINT: DO NOT WEAR YOUR BAND TOO TIGHT. I can still fit my finger under the band when it is on my wrist and it still works perfectly, it doesn\'t have to cut your circulation to work... and my bad, the EZCO 3 pack does not live up to expectations, seems the protector develops bubbles quickly and eventually just falls off, which saddened me because I liked those protectors in particular, but I did get [6 Pack] Aimtel Compatible with Fit2https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JPQ54Y4?and they seem to work very well, I have had them 5 days so far and no problems at all. Good luck y\'all', 'Nada diferente a lo esperado', 'Padrisimo. Resistente al agua y muy bonito', ""I'm comparing this to Fitbit as my family has had more than 1/2 dozen of the small non smart watch variety including Charge 3, Alta HR, Inspire 2.Band Style- I like the Charge band style. Wider and skinnier. Fit2 is narrow but thick like an alta HR. It's thickness is hidden in most of the product shots. Fitbit tends to have a lot more band replacement options.Screen- The color screen and more clock faces makes this the winner. The charge 5 has a color screen but it wasn't available when I got this band.Social- Hands down Fitbit wins. There are so many more people using Fitbit as it was the first widely adopted tracker. Most people I know use it. I don't know anyone who uses Samsung fit. But this of course will depend on social circle.Connectivity/Reliability- I've had zero problems connecting this to multiple android phones (haven't tried Apple). I've wasted many hours connecting and reconnecting my many Fitbits to both Apple and Android phones. It's been a huge time waster. Fitbit pay completely disappeared after a firmware update. I've hard reset and reinstalled the Fitbit app more times then I'd like to count. For this reason alone I swithed from Fitbit.Price- Hands down fit2 is the clear winner. It has mostly the same features at 1/2 the price.Accuracy- I tend to get more steps on fitbit then on the galaxy. I didn't manually count but it would appear a get more free steps (registered steps when not actually stepping) on the fitbit but the galaxy may be missing a few actual steps, so I'd say it a draw. Fitbit says my resting heart rate is between 63-67 bps consistently whereas galaxy has it somewhere between 45 and 90 which doesn't seem right. And based on other reviews I'd say Fitbit is the winner for heart rate.Reports- I liked the emailed weekly reports from Fitbit. Samsung weekly reports give you your average daily 'activity' minutes and daily average sleep and not much more. It doesn't give you any info on your daily or weekly total steps which is really bizarre. It should be trivial to add this. You could go to other locations in the app and calculate this yourself however but that would be painful. Note: I've read many of the detailed reporting features are going behind a pay-wall for Fitbit Charge 5 which is a shame.Other- Fibit emails you when your battery is low which is really helpful if you don't keep the battery indicator as part of the clock face.- Fit2 lets you find your phone from the watch. I'm too embarrassed to say how often I use this feature.- Unlike other watches, neither lets you use the watch as a remote shutter.- Charge 4 has build in GPS (but it kills your battery within hours).- Fit2 has a stress indicator. It is undocumented how this is determined but there is a lot of speculation out there... It appears to think I'm OK when I'm sitting and stressed at work but stressed when I'm out enjoying a bike ride. Is it just measuring heart rate? Seems like a gimick.- Comparable batter life to the small Fitbit trackers.Verdict- If Samsung could improve the accuracy of the heart rate sensor and and improve the reports it would be the clear winner. If Fitbit could improve connection reliability, come down a few bucks, and stop trying to force you to use their premium services it would take the trophy. Being where things are it's mostly a tie but I'd say Fitbit edges out Samsung because I feel a bit more motivated to keep up my workouts based on the report features, and that's really the most important point of having the tracker. But you still can't go wrong the Fit2."", 'Good value for money , good postage', 'Primeiro queu gostei que da marca Samsung e aModinha e Miband mais não quiz arriscar na época meu celular era Samsung hoje faz mais de 1Ano ainda uso está em perfeito estado uso ele com iPhone ainda recomendo ele um pouco mais caro mais vale pena bateria dura uma semana com notificações ligada', 'I had a fitbit for years and in the end I couldn\'t even see the time. So it was useless. This watch is SO bright and easy to read. I was sitting in a waiting room the day I after I got this and I felt the watch buzz and it send me a message -  ""you have been sitting for almost an hour. Get up and walk""  I almost laughed out loud. I called my husband and told him my watch is nagging me to get up and move. He thought it was great.', 'Dura mucho la pila y comodo']"

Fixed that immediately. Got a new SIM card on a different network with VoLTE function. But lo and behold, it didn't work. And that marked the beginning of a 4 to 5-week nightmare of trying to troubleshoot this, which resembled Groundhog Day set against the backdrop of tech customer service.The responsiveness of the support was great. I could reach them via Amazon chat, text messages and Whatsapp. Less great was the fact that they kept telling to do the same things over and over again, even if I told them I literally just did it. The solutions seemed to be limited to the following:Insert SIM card properly until you hear a click.Call the watch with your mobile device.Reboot.It didn't matter that I did everything that was asked of me and it still didn't work. The solutions suggested were consistently the same. Insert SIM card properly until you hear a click. Call the watch with your mobile device. Reboot. Doesn't work?

I guess some loves are just not meant to be.Just got a new line and SIM card with a different network and it works now. After 2 months and 3 SIM cards, we are finally able to use the watch. The network: Circles.Life. Considering how the watch troubleshooting experience went very much in circles, it makes sense they're compatible.In summary, the watch does not work with all network providers, at least here in Singapore.The above aside, the watch works fine. Only one significant beef: Whatsapp on the watch has a button which brings you to the top of the conversation but nothing to bring you to the end. So if you accidentally pressed the button, you'd have to scroll through the entire conversation to get to the end. Oh and you can't seem to delete messages either."", 'This is a good smartwatch for my kid. The watch works very well. GPs tracking, video calling and messaging is very helpful.

Overall is a good buy.Update (22/9/23)The first watch is not working well with the video call just within a month (no voice can be heard from the watch whenever I video call my son). updated the customer service and got a replacement (after an incredible long wait for 3 weeks).The replacement watch is not able to charge.

Then I found VIvifi plus at $9.08 a month subscription!!If you need assistance, seller is very responsive (he provides a WhatsApp number in case you have questions)The calls are very clear and tracking is pretty spot on.I have peace of mind now - my child will call and let me know where he is heading to and I can reach him anytime. Very happy with this purchase!!"", 'My son loves the watch as it is boyish and he can call and leave voice messages. He can run WhatsApp and join groups.

Kid likes the watch very much. Good buy.', ""I bought 3 of these smart watches for my kids at Christmas. After a frustrating week of email communication with the seller, Johnny, I gave up on trying to set up the APN and install the tracking app. Johnny kept asking the same questions that I'd already given answers to, while repeatedly promising to solve all my problems. Major SIM providers will NOT help to set up these smart watches, because they want you to only buy their products. I only managed to set up the basic features by myself, so my kids have been using 3 smart watches that: (1) do not have an installed APN or tracking device; (2) reset and lose information every 24 hours; and (3) cannot download anything from the internet except for whatsapp. The final straw for me, and what prompted me to write this review, is that after less than 1 month of using their smart watches, one of them stopped charging (ie; is permanently broken). This is a mechanical problem internal to the watch, as we tried recharging it with all of the chargers from the 3 watches we purchased. Never again, a complete waste of time and money."", 'Johnny is very helpful when we had any problems with the watch. Johny gave solid support during initial installation and very easy to setup.

I mainly needed a fitness tracking watch to track my walks and read notifications that come in on my phone during my walks, with good battery life. The Versa 4 fits my needs, even though it's not as fully featured as other smartwatches in this price range. This is mainly a fitness tracking smartwatch, and not really a fashion watch like other smartwatches. Lots of good watch faces in the gallery to choose from. Battery life is around 5-6 days, so that's a good thing.Some things to note though:- No 3rd party app support, like Spotify. So you can't control Spotify from the watch. Not a big deal for me though, but this might be a deal breaker for some people. The app gallery is quite limited, with only basic apps from Fitbit.- Notifications for apps won't appear on this watch unless you specifically add the app through the Fitbit app. What I found was the app likely checks the app name and only allows notifications to show for apps you select. For example, I have Microsoft Teams app installed on a Secure Folder on my phone, and not installed along with the other apps. The fitbit app doesn't show this application available to select for notifications, so notifications from the Teams app don't show on the fitbit, even though it shows on my phone. A workaround to this is to install the Teams app outside the Secure Folder as well (doesn't have to be signed in, as long as the app is there), and then select it for notifications through the Fitbit app.- Google maps app is not like on other smartwatches, where the whole map appears. The Google Maps app here just shows the navigation directions in text after you started navigation on the Google Maps app on your phone. Not really that useful, in my opinion.- Google Wallet is available, but took me several tries to set up, always saying my card was not accepted. After removing the card from my existing Google Wallet and re-adding it through the Google Wallet on the Fitbit app, it finally was able to accept my card. After it's set up, Google Wallet works perfectly, so it's a convenient feature."", '不整脈あって治療。健康管理に使うことに。同じ使うなら、アレヤコレヤと出来寺良いなと選択。セールで少し安く買えた。電池が思ったほどに持つ。公証６日はだめでも４日か５日は持つわ。腕時計をしてこなかったからか、かぶれてしまう。２日ごとに右手と左手を付け替えている。', 'Happy customer...fitbit versa 4 have long lasting battery, notification etc..', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Not as great as iWatch but good value for money.

Love the features, especially able to keep track of my daily steps.Remaining me to exercise daily..Lost more than 1kg in less than a month. Thanks to Lily!!', 'Good design & the watch & Garmin App are easy to use', '', 'I purchased the Garmin Lily mainly to help with stress management and organization. After using it for almost two years, here are my thoughts about its main features:BODY BATTERYThe body battery is the single most useful feature on the watch. It estimates the amount of energy drain and re-charge throughout the day. I use it to eyeball my sleep quality and how stressful or intense my day was. I also use daily trends in my body battery to help me predict when my period will start. It is a good synthesis of my heart rate and stress stats over time, which helps me visualize the impact of exercise and mindfulness techniques.PERIOD TRACKINGI’ve used other period tracking apps like Clue before, and Garmin’s period tracker is a lot more accurate. I have regular periods, but Clue’s predictions were normally three or four days off. From my experience, Garmin’s predictions usually are spot-on, or deviate by only one day. Compared to Clue, the Garmin app allows you to indicate when you think you’ve ovulated, and Garmin actually uses this information to adjust its predictions. You can also log symptoms on both the watch and app, but I’ve never had my data synchronize correctly whenever I do it through the watch. If I enter data through the watch, it ends up overwriting the symptoms of the previous day with the current one, so I just enter through the app instead. The interface and data visualizations for period tracking also need improvement, but generally the convenience and accuracy of this feature is a plus for me.SLEEP TRACKINGSleep tracking is terrible on this watch. I don’t know if this is true of all Garmin watches, but it has trouble detecting when I’m awake in the middle of the night, or when I fall asleep or wake up. To improve sleep tracking, you should set the time you usually fall asleep, rather than when you actually get into bed. Even then, the predictions are lousy. I believe the Garmin algorithm uses my waking heart rate as a baseline, so its predictions for the same night change at different times during the day. It is possible for me to manually adjust when I think I fell asleep or woke up, just so I have a semi-accurate record of sleep duration. Most of the time, I ignore this feature and just look at body battery or recorded movement during sleep to figure out how restful the night was. Some Garmin watches give you a Sleep Score for each night, but the Lily does not have this feature.STRESS TRACKINGI’ve had no qualms with stress tracking on this watch. The Lily is even able to (accurately) alert me when it detects high stress and gives me the option to start a breathing exercise. I mainly use stress tracking to measure the impact of a breathing exercise or meditation, because I can track the stress changes before and after the activity. It is also fascinating to see how stress is affected by my period.PULSE OxThe Lily is one of the few smartwatches on the market that can continuously measure blood oxygen levels during sleep. However, just by how finicky the sensor is, I doubt that the readings are very accurate. You can measure pulse ox on-demand through an optional widget, but I could never get it to work. You have to stay very still for at least half a minute, and it usually fails to read anything. I have pulse ox turned on during sleep just to collect additional data, but I don’t really use it for anything other than to satisfy my curiosity. The blinking light can get quite bright and occasionally wakes me up in the middle of the night, but not enough to be a nuisance.HEARTRATE MONITORINGThe heartrate tracker appears to be accurate for this watch. I like that you can view your heart rate in real-time. For some watches, you have to wait a couple of seconds until it shows you a reading. I use heart rate to help me manage stress levels and monitor the impact of exercise and mindfulness activities, so the watch works well with biofeedback techniques.COMFORTOne of the reasons I went with the Lily is because of its small size. It’s not heavy or bulky, and it fits comfortably on my wrist. There are plenty of adjustment holes and loops on the band, so it should work well with very small wrists. The band itself is not too thick. Compared to other watches, it’s easy to forget it’s there. I went with the silicon band and have not experienced any adverse skin reactions in the two years that I’ve used it.USABILITYThe watch face is smaller than most Garmin watches. For me, it’s a little larger than my thumb. I have no problems using the touchscreen, but I can see how it may be difficult if you have larger fingers. There are no buttons on the watch – interaction is done purely through the screen. The screen is monochrome, so everything is black and white, but still bright and easy to see (even in the sunlight) with the auto brightness feature. Gesture detection is not the best. Sometimes when I raise my hand, the watch face doesn’t automatically turn on. You may have to exaggerate your movements to get it to work, but it’s not a deal breaker for me. You can just double tap the screen to wake it up.APPEARANCEThe Lily’s appearance is what distinguishes it from other Garmin watches and other smartwatches on the market. Considering that most Garmin watches have all the same features as the Lily (and more!), you’re really paying extra for the size and appearance. The patterned touchscreen looks lovely in direct light. I don’t mind that the screen is monochrome. I think it gives it a classy, understated feeling. But I was really disappointed with the Lily color that I selected. The “tan” band on the rose gold option isn’t actually tan. It’s light grey.DATA SYNCHRONIZATIONI like that you can disable the Bluetooth on this watch. Not all smartwatches have this feature and some people are concerned that exposure to Bluetooth radiation can cause adverse health effects. The watch can store recorded biometrics onboard and synchronize whenever you enable Bluetooth and connect back to your phone using the Garmin Connect mobile app. I also like that Garmin offers an alternate way to synchronize your data with the Garmin Express desktop app, whenever you charge your watch. It is tricky to install without an IT background, but worth it whenever Garmin Connect is experiencing an outage. I also like that Garmin has options to view your data in the browser. There are a lot more features and data visualizations available, as well as fully customizable dashboards.CHARGING AND BATTERY LIFEI estimate that the battery life on this watch is about 3 days. Over a 24-hour period, I normally see a drain of 25-35%, with pulse ox turned on at night. I don’t usually have problems with battery life because it charges quickly. I normally take it off once a day for about half an hour and I’m all set. The charger is a clip-type charger that you connect to the USB port on your computer.NOTIFICATIONSThe Lily can stay connected to my phone for up to 15 yards (my estimate), so if I’m downstairs and my phone is upstairs, I can still get notifications about text messages or incoming calls. With an Android at least, I can even answer calls and respond to text messages (using a selection of generic responses) all from the watch. The Lily can also be synchronized to my calendar. Another nice feature is the “morning report,” which gives me a cute summary of the weather, events, and health stats for the day whenever I wake up.WIDGETSThe Lily is not compatible with Garmin Connect IQ, so you can’t add any custom widgets from the store. I’m a little disappointed about this, but it makes sense given the price and size of the watch. The widgets that are available are just what you need (calendar, weather, music playback (no onboard music storage), etc.).ACTIVITIESThe Lily is limited in terms of available activities. While it does offer a “Breathwork” activity, it is only for 5 minutes (called “Relax and Focus”). There are no advanced breathwork exercises, like “Tranquility,” which helps get you ready for sleep. Some Garmin watches also have a dedicated “Meditation” activity, but the Lily does not (I use “Yoga” instead). You also can’t create your own custom workouts. Lily doesn’t have onboard GPS, so for some activities, you have to be connected to your phone to record GPS data (although it’s not required to start an activity). It’s not a deal breaker for me, but if you’re into fitness tracking, this watch may not have all the features you want.', 'I love this watch.  I had a Fitbit Sense for almost 3 years, but the touchscreen quit working and none of the fixes repaired it.  I also wasn\'t excited about Google absorbing Fitbit and changing things, so decided to look for other options.I\'ve worn a watch since I was about 9 years old and always liked pretty watches, even when working as a nurse.  I always wore a pretty, but dependable watch.  That was one of the hardest decisions to go to a smart watch -- they\'re not small or very pretty.  But I did like my Sense.However, while so many of these watches have lots of bells & whistles, the reality is, how many do you really use?  I realized I wanted to be able to get my texts and notified my cell has a call coming in.  It\'s not unusual for my phone and person to get separated at times, so having the watch  let me know I need to get to my phone is very helpful. Some have mentioned the type is too small to read, but I don\'t have any trouble reading the messages on my screen.  For reference, I\'m 63 and wear 2.5 readers and have no problem.One of the reasons I purchased the Sense was it recorded flights of stairs.  Over time, this became less & less accurate, so I decided that wasn\'t a priority for me.I also like to track my sleep, and the Lily seems to be doing a better job than the Sense.It\'s a bit frustrating that I can only list 6 activities to track on the watch, and both walking and running are mandatory.  This is frustrating, as I will NEVER use the running mode, so I could replace that with another activity I could use.  Also when using the treadmill activity, Lily records it as treadmill running.  Nope!  I walk quickly, but am not running, and never will be!The other difference is that I could change out the bands in a couple seconds with my Sense. With the Lily, it\'s a time commitment to change a band. I obviously won\'t be changing out bands as frequently as I did with the Sense, but the bands are connected much more securely on the Lily.  I also never changed out my watch bands before I had a smart watch, so not a big deal.  I did have to search awhile to find a yellow gold band that matches the yellow gold rim on my Lily.  Everything is rose gold these days.  Hope more yellow gold will become available.I found it took the watch about 12 hours to ""learn me"" and respond to my movements and gestures.  I had a hard time getting it to turn on at first, but 12 hours later, it was working perfectly and no more issues.I\'ve only had this about a week, so still quite new and I don\'t have any report on dependability.  But, Garmin is a respected brand and I see it is already providing reliable measurements.I\'m very happy with my purchase and love the look of the Lily.  I hope in time Garmin will allow running to be removed from activities and provide a selection of yellow gold bands to match the yellow gold trim.Updated September 2023:I still like the Lily, but Garmin has been less than interested in resolving the treadmill issue, or to have running a manditory activity taking up space on my phone.  I have calibrated my step a couple of times, and yet despite this and walking the EXACTLY same route twice a day for 5 days a week... I always get different distances.I also really miss being able to set an alarm or timer straight from my watch.  Since I have to use my phone to do so, I might as well just use the timer or alarm on my phone.  Fewer steps to get what I need.All in all, it\'s ok.  I\'ll probably be investing in another smart watch in the next year, and just leave this for ""dress"" wear.  Garmin really needs to address some of these issues to make the Lily more friendly.', ""I loved this product as a whole and I had few complaints. Overall, I recommend but a few things could be a challenge for some people. The sleep tracking and activity tracking were terrific. I have a sleep disorder and use a sleep machine that already tracks my sleep but it was interesting to see just how well they agreed. Also, based on my activity on the health app and the Garmin app, they were quite similar.In terms of sleep tracking, I wish Garmin would track my naps as well, haha. Also, for whatever reason the pulse ox aspect of my device was faulty. In terms of charging, I wish they used something a bit more common. A while ago I lost my Garmin charger and it was frustrating to buy a new one because the stores I went to didn't stock replacement chargers."", ""My daughter gave me her old Garmin forerunner when she updated and I liked it but it was really too big for my small wrist. I found the Lily on Amazon, much smaller and the colors are attractive. It seems to be very accurate in terms of steps, sleep, stress, etc., and small enough that I barely notice it, even in bed, so I wear it all the time. Lots of good info on the app. I have some health issues that make it important to be aware of changes in heart rate, stress, etc., and sometimes the Lily gives me a warning that I should sit down and relax.  2 negatives - I wish the time was displayed all the time - I have to tap the face repeatedly sometimes - and the charge doesn't hold as long as the forerunner, although it does charge quickly so not a big problem. I keep the charger in my bathroom and charge while I am in the shower and that is enough. Overall, very pleased with it."", 'Possui todas funcionalidades necessárias de um garmin multiesportivo, não deixou a desejar em nada.']"

Other nights when it said I had poor deep and REM  sleep, I woke feeling great and well rested.  I think a little more work needs to be done on this feature alone so my advice is to take the sleep scores with a grain of salt.

Now that there are thousands of different makes, models and styles I thought it time to dip my wrist in to the smartwatch pool.If you\'re looking for ANOTHER review that discusses the same, useless information about smartwatches then this review is not for you.(I could care-less about the features like ""health, wellness, fit, blood pressure, etc."" and/or opinions about  ""how the watch looks""... All of which you can easily find online or in the products description).Here is what nobody seems to provide in reviews:Specific to the Fossil Gen 6:Received my Gen 6 with 57% charge. Promptly connected the USB cable and charging adapter to the watch and started charging. Charging requires the included specialty USB cable that plugs into a standard USB port on your computer but then has a small, magnetic ring that attaches to the back of the watch and has the ability to sort of rotate/slide in the small, circular groove on the back of the watch. So...no, you cannot use any of the USB cables that you have lying around the house.. The charger/adapter is a little wonky. You sometimes have to rotate/slide it around to get it to make a good connection to the watch. I will probably need to buy at least one more of these ""specialty"" chargers to keep at work.When I first received the watch I ignored the set-up instructions and ""played"" with the device.I was interested if you can connect the watch to a home network without interfacing with your cell phone. The answer is ""yes"" you can connect the device to your home network right out of the box but you can\'t do anything. The watch will indicate you have ""connected"" to your home network but there are very few features, (no apps) and/or much you can do.You will need to/have to pair your watch with your cell phone using the Wear OS app in order to get apps, configuration and customization complete.I bought this smartwatch to use as a tool for work, business and/or communications, not ""health wellness"" and my needs are:1) Can I connect it to a local/guest network and use to verify two factor authentication so I don\'t have to carry my stupid cell phone with me everywhere at work when you want to login to accounts at multiple locations?UPDATE: No....the ""Google"" world will not send the 2FA verification message to this device (Google seems to only like Android/iOS devices. The ""watch"" runs the Wear OS)2) I hate carrying around my cell phone; can I configure various/familiar (office, work, hotel, etc.) networks on the watch and use my Google Voice Phone Number/messaging to make calls, send texts, etc. when I don\'t have my regular cell phone?...UPDATE: Yes/No. Yes, you can connect to any network. No, the ""watch"" does not support the ""Google Voice"" App.3) Can I pair the watch to my wireless earbuds and connect to a random/familiar network (without my cell phone) and listen to streaming/online music (SiriusXM?)?UPDATE: Yes. Disconnect from pairing to phone and pair your wireless buds. Make sure the watch is connected to your/a network and use the Alexa app to launch your streaming music service (Amazon Music, xm, etc.)UPDATE:Cannot pair different phones (Androids) without ""resetting"" the entire watch. When you try to ""pair"" an alternate phone/Android device it will not sync/pair. You have to use the ""Reset"" feature on the watch (instead of the common ""Forget Device"" typically found on Bluetooth devices) which erases everything on the watch and returns the watch to factory default. You can then go through the setup wizard again on the watch and configure the new/alternate device.....dumb!The watch band that came with my device is secured to wrist with velcro. This is nonsense. The watch will easily become dislodged from your wrist with any intense activity (diving, sports, etc.). You will need to get a ""band"" that buckles (and don\'t forget to get a screen protector).You cannot install any app you want. The watch apparently allows what ""it"" wants.Watch has tasks called ""Tiles\' that you can change/configure using the Wear OS companion App (on your phone). Add a ""Tile"" in the Wear OS companion app and it instantly (when paired with your phone) updates the Tile on the watch. You then can ""swipe"" through your ""Tiles"" (tasks). Unfortunately, the watch decides which ""Tiles"" it allows. There are about a dozen and you can\'t seem to add your own unique Tile (task). For example; downloaded and installed the Google Map app (yes it works...sort of) and then wanted to make it a ""Tile"" so I could ""swipe"" to it instead of accessing the ""apps"" section on the watch. Nope, the Wear OS won\'t seem to let me add the ""Google Map"" app/task to the ""Tiles"" option.The watch came with almost no written instructions. The box had a small fold-out of the setup basics, and a thick, 50 page booklet about warranty-safety information (in 20 different languages)...so dumb.Texting is decent. The app is difficult to type with your fingers (letters are so small on the watch face you wish you had a stylus) but the voice-to-text option is simple and works pretty well.The watch will accept/install a ""browser"" app but the GUI and/or navigation is tricky. The watch face is small and therefore finding the ""search box"", results, etc. is challenging..... Better off using the built-in Alexa App to search for information (the watch can/will show graphics/pictures on the Internet but again, the face is so small that it is tricky to get the pic\'s to display easily/reasonably.The built in Alexa app works pretty well. After you sync the Alexa app with your Alexa account you can actually run some tasks/Routines (turn on/off your house lights, play music on the watch, etc.).Unfortunately the Watch doesn\'t seem to populate as a ""device"" in your Alexa cloud/account. The Wear OS Alexa app seems to tunnel into your Alexa account and give you basic (voice only) access. I suppose a seasoned Alexa user (Routine Guru) could exploit/configure their Alexa account to do a variety of cool things using the voice feature on the watches Alexa App..Hoping Wear OS, Android and Google will get together and resolve things like 2FA, Google Voice, pair multiple Android devices, Screen Share (Watch doesn\'t ""share"" it\'s screen to an alternate monitor, TV, screen) etc.. If this happens I wouldn\'t be able to exist with out this SmartWatch', ""I purchased this to replace an older smartwatch which broke. I ultimately decided to purchase a different smartwatch both due to improved technology and better looks but I do think that this was a decent deal for only about $220. It is a bit sluggish at times and it is necessary (as with most smartwatches) to turn off features for the battery to get through the day. The built in fitness app is limited but adequate--I believe stripped down a bit in order to conserve battery life. If price is not an issue, you can do better. However if you are satisfied with the looks of this watch and don't want to pay for a higher end one, this is definitely worth considering.Incidentally the one I received had been returned by someone else and it was still paired to their phone. As a consequence I was initially unable to pair it to my phone. As soon as I realized the problem and did a factory reset it paired fine. Another thing to beware of: I started adding apps and configuring it. Then it installed a firmware update. The update wiped everything and I had to start over adding apps and settings."", ""This watch looks absolutely stunning, it's sleek and sexy (Chrome steel color) but at the same time regular human-sized (some of the newer smart-watches are gigantic!). The display and functionality are great. Voice calls on the watch are surprisingly easy to make and I'm heard very well on the other side. Battery life is good (not great). The only thing stopping it from a five star rating are some quirks (mainly on the software side, the hardware and build quality are rock solid). It sometimes just conks out for no reason even if battery is full. Whatsapp messages don't always appear, and there are sometimes weird delays after touching the screen for no reason. All said, I really love the watch and would definitely buy again.

Below is the comment copied/pasted here.""you will have to redo this video for Wear OS 3 (Gen 6), in case your watch comes natively with a Wear OS 2 from the factory buildIn this case, the watch will do all system updates for Wear OS 2, and then install Wear OS 3Then you are prompted in the watch to switch from Wear OS app to Fossil app, and to pair the watch with.But the instructions here are insufficient: you will be stuck with a pairing error in Fossil appEven if you remove the Wear OS app, you will still be stuck with the same pairing error.To solve this, you will need to open Wear OS app again (reinstall it if you removed it), and remove the watch from this app.This can be done in the ""Advanced settings"" section in Wear OS app.When done, the Fossil watch should not be displayed anymore in Wear OS app.Now factory reset the watch, remove/reinstall Fossil app to be sure all previous data is gone, and redo the pairing.

It worked perfectly.  The Gen 6 version is pretty much the same except for a couple more health and fitness features and 2 extra buttons that do nothing.

After doing all the updates and pairing, I downloaded a new watch face similar to my old Gen 5.  I noticed I couldn't choose any colors other than black or white.  Black is useless because the dial face is black, so text or icons aren't visible.  I put the watch on my charger stand and in the morning I noticed that all of my preference settings were back to default and there was an overheating warning message.  I restarted the watch, reset my preferences, and put the watch on.  About 2 hours later, the battery was nearly drained and it was overheating again as in too hot to wear on your wrist overheating.  After another update, it seemed to fix the battery issue but I still have the overheating message every morning and I have to reset several preferences.

Overall the UI is pretty intuitive and the OS seems very fast without lag.  The screen is very nice OLED.  And big enough to see text easily.  Unlike the Pixel I had for a day this just smokes that.  And for a hundred less.  So far the HR monitor and the 02 sensor seem to work perfectly.  The steps work pretty good and even sets up a basic goal.  First day I got over 8000 steps and gave me a quick notification that I reached that.  I can see how these smart watches can help motivate one to exercise more. I like the weather app but it seems to lag in current temperature.  As it gets its information from a specific Zepp server there is not much you can do about that.  But it works pretty decent nevertheless.You will need to keep the watch connected to BT but for allot of stuff you probably don't need to keep your location on which can drain you phone down.  But for some features you will need that on as well.  There are a limited amount of faces on the watch but there are many more on the Zepp site.  However most want a buck or two for the developer. The text notification works very well for incoming messages.  However the canned responding messages are limited but still very nice being able to do this on a watch.  Now as for the phone calls this phone really rocks the house.  You can easily make and receive calls.  The speaker and voice quality are amazing.  My wife says it sounds like I'm making the call from my phone.  At 200 dollar price point this device delivers.  Setting up the phone takes some doing and I can't remember all what I did but there is stuff you have to check on both watch and phone.  For those that are saying it can't make voice calls they are just wrong.  I'm using a 2 year old LG V60 running Android 13.I have the silicon band and its pretty comfy.  I ordered a higher end fabric band from Amazon.  It uses a standard 22mm pin so there are endless options for leather, metal, silicon bands.  Battery life is also crazy good.  The pixel in comparison is just trash when it comes to battery life.  So even though there may be limited app support with the GTR 4 they package a pretty decent set with the watch .  More importantly, the battery optimization is years ahead of Web os with google.  Web os may offer some nice features but the battery optimization is absolute trash at this point in time.I would say for most people this watch will exceed expectations for a budget smart watch.  If your really into your work outs and want to have the very best tracking in all categories of workouts then the garmin will likely be a better choice."", 'Relógio muito bom', 'O relógio é bem mais bonito do que parece, casual o suficiente para poder usar em várias ocasiões e não tão formal para poder ir na academia.

The shape, size and color are really nice and fit her wrist very well! It just looks so much better than my Garmin. The functions also work pretty well. But it is not without flaws. For example, the GPS sometimes drops signals when my wife and me were running side by side. In contrast, my Garmin Vivoactive 3 (a cheaper and older watch) has no such issue. Another thing, when we went for cycling, my wife clocked 3000 steps while my Garmin only clocked 280. Small issue though.The bottom line, it's a very nice smart watch which tracks your activities. While if you want better GPS signal and more precise sports data, I think Garmin is still better."", ""I like that I can choose the watch face. It is also functional, able to track all the health stuff, like sleep pattern, steps, heart rates.

Also setting up UOB also met with quite some hiccups in UOB Mighty app but eventually I persisted and got it working.

Felt weird why something that's fixed in a older model reappear in the new one. I created a ticket, then was told to raise a feature request. I was dumbfounded, does it mean they built this from scratch without any learning from prior product? What's the product manager thinking or even doing?!?It's downhill from there, the sleep tracking is bad, regularly registering as sleep when I take my watch off. I remember this happened to Versa 1, but it wasn't as bad. And then lately I noticed my heart rate reading randomly goes through the roof, > 200 BPM at certain time of the day. I work out regularly, and it's really hard to push past 170, 200 is absolutely impossible that I don't remember.I heard really bad review in terms of feature cut in Versa 4.

Even on the 12 hour time setting it always shows a 4 digit display. No matter what watch face you pick. If it is 7:15 in the evening (PM) the display definitely should not say 0715...ummmm, that is AM not PM. this is one of the absolute reasons why I hate this watch.The app takes some time to explore and learn. You have to really explore and maybe a few YouTube videos to figure out. It wants you to pay for some items/games/faces etc. I  don\'t think I know anyone who would purchase the ""offered items"".The watch band....I  have seen alot of negative reviews on it. I myself don\'t mind it overly much, even though it isn\'t the best. Very cheap. The hardest part is taking it off. The band (this is hard to describe) tucks under the band and against your wrist, there is no buckle like you would find on normal watch bands. I think it is going to eventually break and probably relatively  soon, if I would keep this watch (which I am currently doubting) I would get a different band.I have not gotten it wet yet so I can\'t comment on the water resistant of it.Connectivity....ie Bluetooth...I still have to have my phone within 10 feet of the watch or I get nothing.  My phone is less than 3 years old (as of 2023), so not entirely sold that my phone is outdated.  Reconnecting takes a few minutes even after I am back within range of my phone.  Reconnecting ""Alexa"" takes even longer. Very disappointing , all around.Music....advertising says play music on your wrist.....not so, you can only control music functions if your phone is playing music.Health data....I  am undecided if this is any where accurate.  So far it has yet to record my sleep data (even after a few nights of having it on), so I am not sure yet if I need to tell it I am going to  sleep or not. I would think that would be automatic.  The app as far as I can see doesn\'t let you change your sleep schedule parameters.It does have a do not disturb option that will allow you to choose the times. I  have not used it yet.Over all, I would NOT recommend this watch, I am probably going to return it and save up for another Garmin watch,  which is what I have used for over 10 years.

I do get double or triple copies of a text at times but I've gotten used to it and just delete them as they come in. This watch saves me from having to carry my phone everywhere around the house to prevent missing phone calls. It's a solid buy for a watch that is under $100. I will say I only use the watch for the basics. Not exercising or monitoring various health indicators. I'm sure that would factor in to the battery life.

I charged it full when I got it 8 days ago and today, 9-8 it is still at 40%.  I don\'t ""baby"" it as I have everything turned on that I use.  I\'ve downloaded some apps that come with the software.  So in my opinion, this Amazfit Bip 5 is everything you could ask for in a smart watch, for a great price.

I have been testing the functions so far it seems very accurate in steps, sleep, GPS & BPM for daily uses. Battery life isn't bad with all the testing it is consuming about 14%/day. I will update this review as we go, but so far it is the best & most accurate watch for the $$."", ""The battery life is really good, If you dont use all the features i'm sure it'll last a few weeks.

I had to replace my Apple watch series 6 due to screen failure and didn't want to buy another one due to still oweing money on it. I chose this watch due to it's similar features of my apple watch. The only thing i miss is being able to use the watch to text. other than that this definitely fits the bill. It tracks my workouts just like the Apple watch and even looks good!

It's still has 42% left and I've had it on for 7 days. When I had my fitbit sense, i had to reconnect it to my phone every day to get notifications. On this one, you can also set your vibration setting for each notification. Now I haven't seen anywhere where I can input my food like I could samsung or fitbit, but I'm still learning. And I know I could just use another app but this is more of a smart watch rather than a fitness watch.

My only bugbear is that it requires pretty strong sunlight to charge, and solar charging is pretty slow and weak. Otherwise, it ticks all the boxes. I feel proud wearing it!"", 'was searching around a sport semi smartwatchvery happy my final pick for this watch', ""I’m a “watch guy”. I probably have about (embarrassingly) 2 dozen watches and I’ve worn a watch, basically, 24/7/365 since I was about 9 years old. I have tried about 4 smart watches and a few fitness trackers over the years before the Garmin Instinct Solar and it’s my favorite that I’ve tried by a lot, BUT…I’ve had a smartphone since the original iPhone. I use it all day every day for tons of different things and, being a watch guy, I thought fitness trackers and smartwatches were a logical progression. That’s why I’ve tried so many but they were always disappointing for numerous reasons.The first is battery life. I charge my phone often. I take it out of my pocket and plug it up. It’s charging while I’m using the GPS to drive to my next service call. But I can’t abide taking my watch off to charge it up every night. Even once a week is a stretch. I’ve been wearing a watch 24/7/365 for almost my entire life and going out of my way to take the watch off and charge it is… irritating to say the least. The Solar Instinct lasts about 20-30 days between charges. That’s with constant activity and heart rate tracking, no O2 tracking at night and not using GPS. That is fantastic!The second issue is annoying alerts. As a rabid smartphone user, I thought I would prefer the convenience of seeing calls, texts and notifications at a glance on my wrist. I was so wrong. I’m perfectly satisfied with notifications on my phone. I use my discernment to decide when to check notifications on my phone and they don't get unnecessarily intrusive. Smartwatch notifications on the other hand are extremely invasive. Having my wrist blow up on me is extremely irritating. It's distracting and costs me time by breaking my concentration on whatever task or thought I'm engaged in and the fact that it can't be easily ignored is no small matter. I have my Solar Instinct set up for no notifications which I greatly prefer.The third consideration would be the features. The ability to control your music or engage your phone’s camera with your watch is fine but those types of things (or, obviously, phone notifications) don't concern me. What I love about the Solar Instinct is the customization to display many pieces of information that I value, by default, on the face and the ability to track my heart rate 24/7, my sleep, my general activity and GPS without a huge battery life cost or a phone connection. What I really like is that it also has good watch functionality, i.e. stopwatch, timer, alarm, etc. What I find useful on occasion is the O2 monitor and the ability to use it as a little flashlight in a pinch.The final consideration which may be the one most pertinent for me is ruggedness. You see, in the HVAC trade, I work with my hands for a living. I'm also a red-blooded American. In addition to the physical nature of my job I frequently do yard work and find occasion to cut down/up trees, split wood, build things, work on things and engage in maintenance on vehicles and my home and, as established, I wear a watch at all times which includes when engaging in these activities as well as showering and swimming. I have destroyed many watches, particularly the ones I’ve worn while working.When I first got my Instinct Solar I was babying it because, well, my experience has been that smartwatches and activity trackers are FAR from rugged and robust. I didn't wear it at work. I would swap it out with my work watch when I got home & swap them back before I left in the morning. I wanted it to last and, to start, I sacrificed tracking during the majority of my activity (while at work) for the sake of protecting the watch and longevity.Finally, after a few weeks, I wore the watch while doing yard work on the weekend. THE FIRST TIME I wore it while weed-eating the screen got busted. Now, I'm sure the reason this happened is that they used a nice, hard, highly scratch-resistant crystal for the watch BUT this is a real problem. I didn't expect that it would be too much to ask of a “robust” watch that’s “mil-spec” rated to be able to wear it while doing basic yard work. You know, a period where you might want to track your heart rate and activity. What's more, of the hundreds of times I've done yard work and used a weed-eater, always while wearing a watch, NOT ONCE has it ever damaged a watch. Until that is, the first time I did it wearing my Instinct Solar.I replaced that watch and disappointedly decided I'll just have to use screen protectors from now on. The new Instinct Solar took a dive after just a few weeks. It began an endless bootup loop. It would boot up and crash and boot up again endlessly. I tried charging it, letting it die and doing a hard boot. Nothing worked.Tech support had me, of course, do another hard boot because that's what they do to people who take the time to troubleshoot their own issues. They have you repeat the steps you've already taken. After that they had me send them a video of what the watch was doing and they promptly sent me a replacement. They did make it right.By this point, I decided I'm done babying it. I keep a screen protector on it and I may remove it to shove my hand/arm in a tight spot at work but I wear it 24/7 now. It is what it is. If this watch can't handle normal life so it can track my heart rate and activity then so be it. I have plenty of “normal” watches I can revert to in that event (which cost a fraction of the cost by the way). If that occurs I suppose I'll just forget about smartwatches until someone finally comes out with one that at least has the capabilities of the Instinct Solar and is truly rugged.As a side note, we are now back to warm weather and I have worn it while weed-eating twice. That resulted in cracking and replacing the screen protectors for the first two times. So, the tally is weed-eating three times resulting in one broken watch and two broken screen protectors. I'm also not fond of the proprietary watch band attachment that prevents the use of a regular band like 99% of other watches use. At this point, however, I'm not sure this will even become an issue. I don't see the watch lasting long enough to require a band replacement but we’ll see.As much as I like the Instict Solar it just doesn't seem to be resilient enough to hold up to my normal life. It may be absolutely great for someone who lives in an apartment, works at a desk or a counter and whose physical activity consists of working out at the gym or running or swimming or biking. If, on the other hand, you have a rough-and-tumble kind of life you should think twice about spending the scratch on this watch if your plan is to wear it 24/7. It certainly seems tougher than 99% of smart watches but it can't hold a candle to the beating the right $30-$40 Casio can take, much less a G-Shock."", 'I\'ve had this watch for a few weeks and I wanted to give a review because I feel this watch deserves one. First off, this is not going to be a technical review, more of an overview and my experience so far. If you are looking for a review that gives detailed specs. GPS accuracies, and types of activities that can be tracked, you might want to read another review. For most people just looking for an activity tracker, this watch might be a little overwhelming. While I don\'t go on long jogs or marathons, and I\'m not into rugged mountaineering, I feel like this watch could definitely handle that. I was just looking for a watch to track my daily activity, walks or runs in my neighborhood, occasional tail hikes, sleep, pulse ox, phone notifications, and include things like weather, stopwatch, countdown timer, compass, and most of all have a great battery life. This watch easily delivers all of that. In fact, there are so many features in this watch, I\'d say that most people might never try them all.  I would suggest that anyone interested in this watch download the manual from Garmin\'s website and just look at what it offers.This watch is very light and comfortable. In fact, I\'m amazed they were able to pack so much into this watch and I can barely feel it on my wrist. The band has a large number of adjustment holes in the strap. So, nearly everyone should be able to adjust it to fit comfortably. Many of my watches only have 8-10 holes in the strap and it can be hard to find an adjustment that is not too tight or too loose. The adjustment holes in this watch strap go all the way up to the watch itself. They also allow good ventilation, in case you sweat during a workout.The battery life in this watch has been amazing for me. I\'m the kind of person who drains a watch battery in 1/2 of the amount of time it\'s supposed to take, and that is without including GPS activities. The first time I fully charged this watch, it showed a 27 day battery life. Without doing GPS activities, it will easily make it a full day and show 26 days by the next day. In my experience, the watch seems to calculate the remaining battery life based on recent usage. So, after a GPS activity, you might see the number of days decrease accordingly, like using an extra day or two of battery life depending on how long your activity is. But, sunlight will help with that. Garmin recommends that you give the watch 3 hours of full sunlight a day. While that would be nice, it\'s not really practical on a daily basis for me. But, in my experience, it\'s not really required either if you are just looking for a watch that will make it through the better part of a month without charging. What 3 hours of sunlight will give you is about 2% , or +1 day battery life.I like the fact that I can wear this watch and never worry about getting it scratched or damaged. Working outdoors, mowing, trimming, occasional chain saw use, this watch won\'t even flinch. It\'s very rugged and well built. I actually appreciate the fact that it does not have a touch screen. You can navigate through all of the menus and options, even with gloves on. Phone notifications are very prominent (they use a double-buzz for each one), so even while working outside, I can still feel it.I also have a Garmin Venu and I enjoy the full color touchscreen. But after using this watch, I realized that you don\'t actually need a full color screen. In fact, I realized how much I missed not having a watch with a display that was easily visible in any light and be always on. Yes, the Venu has an always-on screen option, but it is not very visible in sunlight and the battery life with that display on was extremely short. I like being able to look at the Instinct\'s display any time and see the time down to the seconds, and everything else I need without trying to tilt my arm just right or tap on the screen. One thing that I thought that I\'d miss is the Garmin ConnectIQ store, which is on the Venu but not on the Instinct. But to tell you the truth, I don\'t miss it. I know you can get all kinds of unique widgets for your watch there, but a lot of them are just fluff. Everything you would typically need is already ""baked into"" this watch. The nice part about that is all of the widgets on the Instinct are Garmin widgets so you know they were designed specifically for your watch, and they will work. One item I have been missing that I think should be included with the weather is the current UV index.One thing that I did miss was the ability to make customizations to the Instinct watch from the Garmin Connect app. Nearly everything from the watch faces to the widget settings were configurable on the Venu from the Garmin Connect app. Most of the changes you need to make to the Instinct, you\'ll need to make on the watch itself through the settings menu. As it turns out, I like to tinker with the settings on watch, so it ended up not being a big deal after all. One trick I found in the settings to save a little battery life was to turn off the display light when I press a key. This watch is so customizable. You can even set the display light to come on when you press a key only after sunset, for example. But I just turned mine off because if you do need the display backlight, you can simply press the upper left button and it will come on. You can set the timeout for the backlight, but it will automatically stay on as long as you are interacting with the watch and pressing buttons.With 5 physical buttons, there is a learning curve with this watch. However daunting it might seem, within a day or two, I was intuitively using the watch and knew which buttons did what.  The buttons are very solid and have a nice tactile click when you press them.The Control Menu, which is available in many Garmin watches, is a quick launch list of shortcuts to commonly used activities. This is fully customizable and can include things like alarm list, timers, do not disturb settings, find my phone, sync, and many, many more. It does have a flashlight shortcut, but it\'s too dim to be much use in anything except for close up in total darkness. Navigating through the Control Menu on the Instinct is slightly slower than my other Garmin watches because it is not a touchscreen and you have to scroll through the list of shortcuts to find what you want. But it remembers the last thing you used, and it will open with that item selected the next time you launch the Control Menu. The Control Menu on this watch can include more items than you can see on the screen at one time. That is not possible with the Venu because it has a fixed number of slots.The watch faces are very customizable. The default one has a graph on the top left-hand corner. You can use this for things like heart rate, solar charging levels, and so on. I use it to display a barometric pressure graph. And even that is fully customizable, to graph either the last 6, 12, 24 or 48 hours. There is a prominent circle on the upper right of the screen that can customized to contain things like the date, or current temperature, or heart rate, or altitude, or barometric pressure/trend,  or moon phase, or many others. I use it to display the number of notifications currently on my watch. Notifications can be easily dismissed on the watch and they immediately disappear from your phone. Just be aware that it is the down button that dismisses the notification. It is also the same button used to scroll down though the notification content when you select the notification. More than once, I\'ve accidentally dismissed the notification thinking that I was going to scroll down to see the additional content.I like the Sunrise and Sunset times, as well as the Moon phase with the moon rise and moon set times widgets. You can even include some of these details onto a watch face. I use part of the lower section of the default watch face to display either the sunrise or sunset time, depending on which comes next. I also include the day/date in the other section of the lower watch face. As you probably figured out, the lower second of the default watch face can contain 2 separate data elements.Overall, this is probably one of the best watches I have. I enjoy the extended battery life and the fact that the watch is highly customizable, and very durable. And I didn\'t even cover what this watch can do with respect to activity tracking, ABC functions, and GPS capability. That would be a another review altogether.', 'I’ve had this watch for 4 months. I couldn’t decide between a four or five star rating. I went with five because the cons I see are more my complaints than the device. I wish it had Vo2 Max. And I wish it didn’t break me out (rash around wrists, I have to switch it at least once a day). I’m allergic to everything though and this watch has been the least irritating one I’ve owned (in several areas but I’m just talking skin right now).Pro- it’s rugged. I have beat this thing up. I should probably buy one of those screen protectors for it but so far it’s holding up nicely. I am rough on accessories. I only wear this watch and a silicone wedding band. Because I break everything on my person while out working on the farm and taking care of the house. Break a diamond off an engagement band while unloading a washing machine- check. Have a cheap fitness tracker ripped off by a goat and then trampled-check. I’m rough on stuff. And this watch holds up.Pro- Battery. I charge it while in the shower. That’s it. I think maybe a few times I left it on charge longer than a shower (once over night and an occasional trip to town after a shower and I forgot to put it on). It holds charge better than anything I own. I don’t know if it’s the solar aspect of it or it’s just got a phenomenal battery, but I wish all of my devices lasted like this thing. I wear it day and night.Pro/con-night wearing. I’m not a huge fan of things on my wrist while I sleep. That includes this thing. It’s not sleek. It’s a bit on the bulky side. And I have found that for some reason it reads better while it’s on my right wrist. For example the body battery always seems to be better if I put it on my right at night. And I find it reads hr better while exercising if it’s on my right as well. Not sure why this is. That’s somewhat bothersome because as I mentioned before I have to switch wrists at least once a day (so roughly 12-16 hrs on one wrist). However, I do enjoy the stats I receive in the morning. I also didn’t know my hr dropped so low through the night…a topic I’ll bring up to my dr at next visit. I like to see the stress level meter. I find it accurate (mostly) and quite interesting to try to change. Apparently I’m quite stressed…and some of my favorite activities are stressful to my body. I’m learning to find balance.Pro- I love love love that it’s not touch screen. I thought I wouldn’t like that when I got it but as I’ve worn it and touched that screen so many times on accident I think back to all the accidental texts I’ve sent my contact list while wearing apple.🤦🏼\u200d♀️🤦🏼\u200d♀️🤦🏼\u200d♀️ and how many texts I’ve received from contacts that wear apple. It’s frustrating and I’m so glad I don’t have to deal with that.Pro/con- the side buttons. They take a little getting used to if you’re used to a touch screen, but you’re smart, you can do it👍 they do occasionally get pressed by accident, but it’s not too big of a deal…Pro-app. I like the app. It’s user friendly. No frills, bells or whistles. Get the info you need and go on about your day.Pro/con- band. It’s ok. I like that it’s breathable…but I can’t for the life of me get it ‘just right’ it’s always too tight or too loose. I find if it’s too tight (so it doesn’t slide around) it doesn’t read hr accurately. And if it’s too loose and you’re moving a lot, it doesn’t read hr accurately. I’m kinda learning the sweet spot but it’s still not perfect…All said, this is a great fitness watch for anyone who is rough on stuff and needs long lasting battery. If I think of other things or find more pros/cons that need to be shared, I’ll edit.', ""I have had a fit bit before and it was trash compared to the Instinct Solar. I have had this watch for about a year and love it. The battery lasts usually about 15 days or so. I get a lot of emails and messages which I am notified through my watch, (you can select what notifications you get). My fitbit was charged every night and I hear Apple watches amd most other watches need to be charged at least every other night. No I can't make phone calls through it but that is ok with me. It has so many features you will need to watch a tutorial to figure them out. I love how accurate it is with the step counter and how many flights you go up and down. It has a body battery meter which tells you how rested you are. After many months I figured out it was pretty accurate. It also has a sleep tracker which works very well. As I mentioned, it has tons of features. Check it out and buy one. I don't get commissions or any thing from this. I just like to recommend a good product when I find one."", 'I\'d been wearing a garmin forerunner 230 for about 6 years and had a much less impressive 1st gen garmin step tracking watch before that. Nothing can compete with Garmin battery life and the forerunner had all the metrics I liked to gush over. I\'d tried cheating on it with the galaxy active watch, but it was a quick, disappointing fling. Then for Christmas, my husband got these for us. I\'d said for months that the instinct (the solar in particular) would be the only watch worth upgrading to because of improved battery life and a built-in altimeter. He helped me make the transition and I haven\'t looked back. (He has also never been one to stick to a smart watch for long, but I\'ve only seen this leave his wrist once or twice for charging.) As a runner, I\'ve been blown away with the changes having a built in heart rate monitor has made in my training (the 230 didn\'t have a heart rate monitor like its 235 twin). And I\'ve found the feedback accurate enough for my purposes. The altimeter is significantly more accurate than relying on my phone metrics (I live and run in the mountains). And as expected, the battery life is phenomenal. (I\'ve charged it 2x in 2 months. I don\'t use many phone/internet features, but I run 4hrs/week.) As a runner, there are a couple drawbacks that I might figure out how to remedy with time. 1) The top issue is that there isn\'t a ""lap"" button. So, if you\'re used to having that on the go, you have to pause the workout, tell the watch to register the pause as a lap end, and then start the workout back up. This could be a pain if you enjoy ""free-style running"" and using the lap function throughout OR you use the lap button to move forward with your preset workout. 2) I\'m not a fan of the activity screen when running. The metrics shown are pretty minimal and not terribly useful, but I just click to the screen I\'d set up and that\'s fine. 3) Watch faces are limited to four layouts and you pick what is displayed. I miss my old watch face, but I\'ve adapted to that as well. I really like that I can display moon phases in the circular spot at the top of the display. That circular spot is the reason watch faces are limited. It\'s part of the screen and of every watch face and metrics screen. 4) The band is not my favorite. Now that I\'m working with heart rate, getting a proper fit is crucial. The band that comes with the watch is comfortable and secure, but my ideal size is between two of the notches and I haven\'t found a remedy for that yet. Also, I don\'t sleep with my watch on. The nub that holds the piece securing the strap can kind of make it a pain to get the watch off because it\'sgood at its job. 5) The watch won\'t freak out if you are in an activity and start driving. This can be both good and bad. If you want it tracking your drive, it\'s great. If you forget to stop the tracker after a workout, you\'ll blow all your pr\'s out of the water... 6) Just pressing the back button while in an activity doesn\'t stop that activity. It will, however bring you back to the home/time screen and continue tracking. For someone hiking or running many miles, this could be a plus. For a short run, you can end up in the car scenario mentioned above pretty quick.I know I listed quite a few cons, but honestly, it is top notch. My husband also loves it and loves tracking our hikes with it, which it does very well. I have to drive to where I run. So I have to take my phone and wallet with me regardless of what my watch can do. If I was walking out my front door to go for a run, my needs would be different. Having a watch that could store music and a credit card and make an emergency call or text would be higher on the priority list. But for an adventurer in the boonies, it\'s absolutely perfect!', ""This watch is life changing. It's just a very high tech precision instrument especially at such a low price. It exceeded my expectations in every way.I will say not enough people speak on the nav portion of this watch. It's so nice to finally put away my old Garmin fortrex 401 since this has all the same functions and more with the support of GLONASS and Galileo and the Battery lasts long whereas the fortrex drained through triple As in about 4 hours.

It was well worth the drive in a blizzard risking life and limb to obtain one elsewhere just in the knick of time for christmas. Speaking to the reps at amazon was an amazing experience. We feel completely appreciated as prime members to have such fluent reps who know how to speak efficiently and clearly in multiple languages, it helped me best understand where and why we had our issue and it makes me want to learn more languages so I can help others too. Especially the 35 minute call where we were offered a full refund and cancelation at the end of the extended hold time (that music rocked too!) all of this a day before Christmas. This was highly appreciated and makes us likely to return. We are disappointed we cannot request certain reps if we ever need to call back, he was top notch and deserves a promotion for explaining so well what happened. It all made perfect sense and was completely reasonable. As for the function of the watch…This watch fits her small wrist, had an amazing flashlight so when she drops it a thousand times we can easily find it, oh wait, I mean when she drops it a thousand times we find it with her new fire tablets light, but regardless we find it. The best feature is the lock we can put on it to limit her time using this in a blank mental zone, and allow it when we need a break so we can zone- lol. You can put it in a mode so as not to be a distraction at school, supposedly. Insert eyeroll. This should probably just be an at home thing people…its quite the watch. Battery seems good, fairly easy to use and my favorite part is actually when you go to the parental settings it has this unique security feature to ensure kids cant break into it and change their settings.

I do like both of them but the GTR 4 seems to be a little bit of an upgrade. It is bulkier and heavier then the GTS 4 but I still prefer it. I know the GTS 4 is listed as a women's watch versus this one, but I still like the larger watch face of GTR 4. Also it's easier to find what you need weather for Workouts or health such as BPM, Steps. PAI, Sleep, Blood Oxygen, Stress Level etc.  The Watch Faces seem extra nice too. There are plenty of them. Some more geared for weather with beautiful designs to choose from, while others geared for health stats you can view during the day. I plan to use the women's GTS 4 for when I swim to keep track of the health side during that time in the water. I have not tested that yet on the GTS 4. I'm hoping water doesn't get into the watch face. There is a water eject on both watches but I read an article about smart watches in general which can be used in water, can fog up the face. Hoping that won't be true with the GTS 4. I don't want to take a chance with the GTR 4 that way since I like that one a bit better. The watch face is easier to read on the GTR 4; much better that way. The Zepp App takes getting use to but after a few days of using it, the things you are looking for get easier to find. The charge cord is magnetic and it charges within a few minutes. It's excellent that way. Also there are plenty of wrist bands to purchase for easy on and off so you can change it out at will. It is definitely a good purchase and watch. I looked at various other high end ones, $200 to $400 range, which this falls into a d I'm glad I chose this. The changing out of the Watch Faces was an important feature for me as well. There is an amazing variety and colors and styles to choose from. I would recommend this watch completely. The size of the face is excellent so there is no straining your eyes to see your stats. It's solid. It is a bit heavier but I got use to it quick. I'm female with smaller wrist and I still love it. I never have a problem with the watchband that came with it, it so far has not irritated my skin. I recommend this watch completely."", ""I'm coming from the GTR 3 Pro Limited Edition. I just purchased it last month and was disappointed to see that the sequel was released so soon, but that was because I loved the GTR 3 Pro Limited Edition's design language, battery life, and OS so much that I knew I would have to grab one! My main gripes with the GTR 3 Pro were display refresh rate usually being locked to 30hz, OS slowdowns when more than 3 notifications popped up, and Alexa being a bit muffled. Thankfully all of that has been fixed in this iteration. The device is smooth as butter and runs at a constant 50 to 60 hz! Still waiting on the update for Alexa support. There was an OTA update when I set the watch out but I didn't come with Alexa so I'm assuming within a couple of weeks we should have it. Hopefully Alexa's voice is clear and I'll have zero complaints with this watch! The design is an evolution of last year's model, with more masculine and streamlined design as opposed to last year's flat design. I'll include an image of the two! The watch faces are now interactive which is a nice feature to see, for instance if a watchface has the current weather or your heart rate on it, you can tap on the said portion of the watchface to receive detailed information on that particular metric, weather, etc. This was a feature on very few watchfaces for the GTR 3 so it's nice to see it be available on nearly all watchfaces now on this model, I also appreciate the inclusion of Wi-Fi for updating from the watch as well as water ejection for when you go for swims or showers. Battery life has also been improved by a couple of days which is great. The GTR 3 Pro lasted me 4 days with always on display and tilt to wake always on. All the new watch faces are very nice and appealing to look at as well which is great to see because one of my complaints from last year's model was that some of the watch faces made the watch look a little cheap but these new ones are all elegant! The membership card feature is excellent as well, as you can put your gym membership onto your watch so you don't need to bring your card or scan your phone! My only critique is for the Zepp OS. I would like to see more playful animations when interacting with the watch and would like the always on display to fade transition into the main watchface rather than the current cut transition. Other than that I love the OS! Great job to Amazfit! I'm glad they're listening to the community and improving their products tenfold every year! I'm excited to try the GTR 5 Limited Edition at the start of next year! You've got another yearly customer on your hands!"", ""Before buying this Amazfit GTR 4 Limited Edition, I was using a Fitbit Versa 3 and I simply adored the fitness reporting capability because it helped me to control various aspects of my high blood pressure more closely.  The only real reason that I stopped using the Fitbit is because the Versa 3's GPS would stop in areas of weaker reception to the point that I became so frustrated that I overcompensated by buying this particular Amazfit watch because of its beefed-up capabilities in that arena.  So, what I am left with is a very nice watch with great GPS mapping capability an many nice features, but, a very weak controller application in Zepp 2.0.  The folks at Zepp have sidestepped offering useful exercise statistical reporting in favor of calming music while you sleep in the form of Zepp Aura, a feature that I have absolutely no use for.  In my opinion, the folks at Zepp should beef up the part of their app that offers its users the ability to recall ALL useful exercise statistics over longer periods of time instead of just the few that THEY think are important.  Is the Amazfit series of watches being manufactured and targeted to aromatherapy junkies and people who find sleep music more important than exercise and exercise tracking stats?  If so, I would love to know so I can avoid what otherwise is a nice watch and go back to Fitbit who has a great free app for its watches.  The Amazfit watch is too nice to be stuck with an app like Zepp!"", ""My primary desires for a smartwatch are notifications, battery life, aesthetics and screen. I really don't have much need for the other functions, though the sleep tracking is at least interesting.This watch delivers! I get all notifications (when Bluetooth is connected) and with the always on screen activated it's at least 2 weeks between charges. The Limited Edition is very low key but beautiful (IMO). However, I did buy a new band.My previous watch was a Garmin Vivoactive 4S (the S mean smaller screen) so I was a little nervous about the size, but I actually like the (slightly) larger one on this device. Another difference is the GTR 4 screen is AMOLED, which is gorgeous, but it's a little more difficult to read in direct sunlight. I usually have to activate the 'full screen' in that case (which doesn't bother me in the slightest).This is my 4th Amazfit device."", 'Schöne Uhr, Klassisch zeitlos.

I never used it for my Alexa anyway. Battery life is very good. It is light and slim and fits my small wrist well. The price is very good for a useful smart watch.The proprietary charging cord is too Short! See the photo. It is only 17"" long and won\'t reach from the charger plug to a night stand or end table. The charger cord for my GTR 3 is 32"" long.  I think it is an important point. How much extra would it cost to provide a decent length charging cord!?And yes.... I can get an extension but that is not the point.This is the reason I only gave 4 stars. Lack of attention to the detail.Overall this smart watch is a good value for the money.', 'Have been putting this through some abuse now, and this is what I have to say:HR is in line with other monitors I’ve tried. Same with o2 sat. Sleep tracker can be glitchy for me being on an overnight schedule; it doesn’t like to recognize my normal sleep sessions and counts them as a nap. I guess that’s something to do with their algorithm and when you go to sleep past a certain time. For me, I’m more concerned with the overall amount of time I was asleep rather than all the other metrics. If it shows I had an 8-hour “nap” because I went to bed too late and I wake up feeling rested, it’s enough to see that sleep duration (I’m really bad about keeping track of when/what time I fall asleep)Was honestly shocked at how accurate the activity and resting calories burned trackers have been; they fall directly in line with how much weight I’ve been losing vs my caloric deficit through this cut. The few workout modes I use (strength training, indoor cycling, outdoor running) all seem to work well enough, and it’s interesting looking at the metrics sheets the watch and app come up with for the workouts. Is it 100% on point? Most likely not. Is it close enough to have an idea of how I’m pushing myself through my workouts? AbsolutelyIt shows texts notifications, but not WhatsApp notifications. It doesn’t get the Do Not Disturb memo from my phone and lets texts through, unless going into the watch’s settings and turning on the watch’s Do Not Disturb. Swipe controls can feel a little sluggish, and water streams from a shower head can manipulate the screen. Slightly annoying, but nothing I can’t ignore/get past.GPS tracking has been accurate for runs through my suburban neighborhood, though haven’t tried it outside of this smallish area yet. As far as battery life and charge speed: both have been absolutely phenomenal (Recent run went from 100% to 39% over 6 days and took maybe 30-40 minutes to come up to 100%). Build quality on it is decent. Not the fanciest, but it definitely doesn’t feel like something cheap.Overall, for the $120 I spent on it, I was actually impressed. Was really just looking to snag a basic watch and fitness tracker combo, but this surpassed the expectations I had. Yeah, there are things that could be better with it, but for the price point, I’m happy with what it can do.', 'The GTR Mini feels lightweight but also premium. It has some really beautiful faces and clear screen. I love the rose-toned trim. I’ve only been wearing it for 3 days and already gotten several compliments. So far the battery life is great (only lost 30% in three days so we’ll see how much I can get out of the first charge) and GPS has been spot on when I take it for a run. The sleep tracking also appears to be very accurate.  There are some features I haven’t totally utilized yet, but it’s easy to use and it seems to be a great watch.', ""I recently had the opportunity to try out the Amazfit GTR Mini Smart Watch, and I must say that I'm thoroughly impressed with its features and performance. First and foremost, the design of the watch is sleek and stylish, fitting comfortably on my wrist. It's a perfect blend of aesthetics and functionality.One aspect that stood out to me was the wide range of health tracking features and reminders available on this watch. From monitoring my daily activities to providing insightful data on my sleep patterns, the watch excelled in helping me maintain a healthy lifestyle. The accuracy of the functions, including step counting and sleep tracking, seemed spot-on, giving me confidence in the data it provided.One of the standout features of the Amazfit GTR Mini is its exceptional battery life. Even with continuous use, the watch conserves power effectively, allowing me to go about my day without worrying about frequent charging. This is particularly useful during longer activities or trips where access to a charger may be limited.Although I haven't tested the GPS functionality extensively, I believe it would be a valuable asset for outdoor enthusiasts. The inclusion of 5 satellite positioning systems promises reliable and accurate tracking, especially during runs or hikes.The overall user experience of the Amazfit GTR Mini is highly satisfactory. The accompanying app complements the watch seamlessly, offering detailed insights and customization options. The app's interface is intuitive and user-friendly, enhancing the overall experience of using the watch.I was impressed by the accuracy of the SPO₂ and heart rate monitoring features. During my use, I didn't notice any significant variations in my heart rate readings, indicating the reliability of the watch's sensors. While I haven't tested the water resistance personally, the watch's 5 ATM rating ensures it can withstand immersion in water up to a certain depth, adding to its durability and versatility.In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend the Amazfit GTR Mini Smart Watch to anyone seeking a reliable and feature-rich device to monitor and improve their overall health. Its sleek design, impressive health tracking capabilities, long-lasting battery, and user-friendly experience make it a worthy companion for your fitness journey."", 'Watch was super easy to pair with my iPhone.  I love the look of it and how easy it seems to be to use. I’m coming from the same Fitbit for over 6 years so it will take some getting used to, but so far it’s much easier than I anticipated.  It does show iMessage notifications without an issue (some reviews said they didn’t work), and shows basically all my phone notifications so far.  I have to say for the price point I am extremely impressed. I did buy a skinnier watch band - which was super easy since it’s just a standard 20mm (way more options than being confined by there brand!!) I’ve had it on now a few days so I will update if my opinion changes in the future.', ""I own a Fitbit Sense, Samsung Galaxy Active2, and Amazfit GTS 4 Mini, and curiously, I liked the Amazfit watch the best.  The Amazfit GTS 4 Mini has more features than I need, long battery life, while not being bulky.My Sense and Active 2 needed to be charged every few days which seemed to be a pain to me.  When do you charge, at night and you lose sleep tracking?  During the day, and you lose the activity tracking?I like the Sense, but the frequent charging issue had me looking for an alternative.The Samsung Galaxy Active 2 is very bulky, and recently, after limited use, the screen started to separate from the bezel, and I could see the glue.  Called Samsung, who basically said I was SOOL.  No Samsung, you are SOOL, because I will never buy another one of your watches.I received the Amazfit GTS 4 Mini was a gift from my daughter a few months ago and I liked it so much so, that I purchased a second, the GTR Mini.  I had considered the full GTR 4, but after comparing the two, the Mini afforded me all the features I needed, minus the ability to answer and make calls, but truthfully, if I need my phone to be with me to use this feature, I mine as well just use the phone.The GTR Mini is as lightweight and thin as the GTS 4 Mini, that I often forget that I'm wearing it.I also like the fact that I can store my gym membership and loyalty store cards on it.  My gym started doing away with the cards, which means once the card has worn out, I'd have to bring my phone into the gym, and a) don't want to risk damaging my phone during my workouts and b) don't want to be one of those annoying members on their phone when someone else is looking to use the equipment.The price point of the Amazfit GTR Mini makes the watch a no-brainer.Hopefully you find my review helpful."", ""I'd consider this a stepping stone for a bigger brand name; usually I stay away from some of the big name accessories just because of how I am as a person. I bought this as a trial run anyways, but I returned it becuade it did not work as it was advertised with some of the rout tracking apps, but it monitored my blood oxygen level accurately and thats why I bought it. I have since returned it and will looks for other option. On a weird note, it had a bad habit of collecting dead skin cells around the back plate and that grossed me out enough to genuinely reconsider the big name purchase at all. Good in a pinch, works alright, but the apps need some work."", ""I will say, if I could have easily gotten one more feature, this would  have been the watch for me. There are no native dexcom watch faces or support. It seems possible to get the dexcom to work, but it requires too much money and effort.Pros:  It is light: Seems to be well made: Not overly complicated to operateCons: Zepp app: Not a lot of free watch facesI have owned a few Fitbit watches, a couple of Amazfit and currently a Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 LTE. I don't care much about fitness tracking, so my main concern it to see blood sugar and get notifications etc. They all do fitness tracking tho, but I can't really comment about each's accuracy.To me, this Amazfit strikes the right balance between what I need displayed and battery life (except for the dexcom issue). It's a nice watch and as long as you don't need exactly what I need, it would be a fine watch to own."", 'I bought this strictly for running, being used to dedicated Garmin watches.  If for all-around use, like as with a FitBit, this would be a good watch, with HR, step, sleep monitoring, etc.  I liked the simple touch screen display.However, for dedicated running:1.  I could not set the display to stay on (in spite of there being a setting for ""always on"") - it constantly dimmed out, and I would have to wait a moment or two while running for the screen to re-illuminate when I raised my wrist to look at data; not ideal when you want to keep your eyes on the road;2.  I could not find a way to easily program custom runs (like an interval workout);3.  I feel that there are too many button-pushes/menu-navigation steps to just go directly to a running workout;4.  There are extra steps (going to a separate screen) to do a simple stopwatch pause while running;5.  In spite of a photo in product images showing a map display on the watch, this actually requires extra steps to upload a self-created map route to the watch - rather cumbersome;6.  I could not get the compass to register in spite of moving the watch in the required figure-of-8 motions for so many minutes that I began to feel like a fool.Good features:1.  Lightweight, sleek, streamlined size;2.  Intuitive, easy-to-navigate on-screen menus;3.  Customizable data fields on the display;4.  Bright, easy-to-read display (when it\'s not repeatedly fading out);5.  Many watch faces with nice display graphics to choose from;6.  Great battery life;7.  Great app (Android in my case) with nice post-run graphics and copious data displayed;8.  Seemingly accurate HR monitor;9.  Great value for the money.In short, this would have made for a good, fun, cheap, all-around smart watch, but fell short for more serious dedicated running (and presumably other exercises).', 'Desde el primer momento, lo amé, la batería me duró la primera vez casi 15 días en uso normal de reloj, conectado al cel y usándolo cuando hago ejercicio, me gustan los relojes grandes y este me encantó, el color es bellísimo, pues aunque es como rosa muy clarito, a veces se ve como gris o casi blanco, justo lo que buscaba, un buen reloj, grande, de buena marca, con mucha opciones de caratulas y sobre todo que la pila le durara varios días, al principio le batalle para que se conectara al celular, pero agarrándole el modo, es bien rápido, lo recomiendo al 100%']"

Attached to my wrist, I won\'t loose it!  I was leery that it works.  I had to switch phones, my Motorola was not supported by dexcom software, see dexcom website for compatibility.1. Make sure you phone will receive dexcom.  The phone reads it, and just sends data to the watch.  Phone has to be within about 20 feet of you.  A. When phone is out of your area..you will loose Bluetooth connection.  B.  If that happens, all I have had to do is open the fit it app on my phone and it starts syncing again .2. Download fitbit app to your phone.  Fitbit is owned by google, now.  You will need a gmail account.  They are free.-- the fitbit app is very clear, follow the menus and change your phone settings to ensure it works well!  The watch will auto connect if everything is set correctly.3. Download the Dexcom app onto your phone.  This software is very good, as well.  It walks you thru any setting s that need adjustment. You do not need Clarity, just the main Dexcom app!--you are successful when your phone starts reading you cgm!  Ps. You need your sensor and transmitter numbers! My transmitter # had to come from my Dexcom receiver!  The sensor...dug in the trash! Found it!4. Last step.  Go to your fitbit app on your phone.  There is a blue icon to select screens, see YouTube videos for visuals!  Search for ""Glance"".  It was created for this use.  download it for your fit it watch.Now you are ready to wear your watch!!! Done!Ps.

Does a good job with heart rate and sleep patterns is interesting.What does NOT work? The step counter.  My first 8 hours, I was asleep.  It was going nuts with alert vibrations.  The FitBit was VERY proud I had walked 150,000 steps at night, asleep.  I must get tons of work out.  No wonder I don\'t sleep well! 😁😁😁😁😂😂 it counted each vibration on all the alerts all night as steps!!! Stupid watch.  I have not tried to fix it.  Don\'t care about that function.I really like the convenience for CGM. I still need my regular receiver.  But this is a quicker glance and a quieter alert.  Its also nice to have weather, and maybe Alexa and Google maps.  Have not tried the maps yet.  Google voice is not loud enough unless its held on your ear!', 'If someone asked me whether I like this watch or not, I would say that I like it. It is simple and the interface is decent. I do not want a watch that attempts to replace my phone, but rather one that complements it. I think that the Fitbit Versa is a good choice for this. It tells me notifications, tracks sensor telemetry, tracks my physical state, and has decent battery life. These are things that my phone cannot easily do.Other smart watches such as the Samsung Galaxy Watch do too much. I don\'t really care that I can reply to texts, browse the web, or essentially replace my phone. I always have my phone on or near me. If I am too busy to reply on my phone then I also wouldn\'t reply on my watch, an only worse experience because they try to cram a full QWERTY keyboard on it.I bought the Fitbit Versa 4 because one of my requirements is that the watch I use has Google Pay on it. It does not at release, but I\'m fine with it coming later as it is not an immediate requirement. I also assumed that the fitness tracking on Fitbit would be good because Fitbit is basically the oldest consumer tracker company I know of, so I guessed it probably works well.Comfort - 9/10The strap that it came with is quite comfortable. I do not wear watches, primarily because the ones I have tried were not very comfortable.  This watch and strap is pretty good. I\'ve only had one day tuning the tightness and position where it was uncomfortable and that was my fault as it was too tight. I also like that it is small and light. I mostly forget it is there, and am comfortable sleeping it with.Update Nov. 5th 2022: After about a month of wearing it almost 24/7 I have some irritation. Also if I sleep with it and put weight upon the watch band (the watch face going down in to the bed) I will wake up with a lot of irritation.Interface  - 7/10The interface is mostly intuitive. It is not that clunky as some smart watches I have seen in the past. The main thing I do not like and I didn\'t quite get at first was that the apps list is found by pressing the button. I didn\'t know how to use the alarm the first night because of this. But overall it works. It is mostly responsive, but sometimes not if it is rendering many things in the interface. I can forgive this as it is not a super powerful watch. I am happy with this.Battery life- 8/10One of the primary things that I want in a smart watch is a longish battery life. The more general smart watches\' battery life is not that great. This one lasts about 3 days with the always on display turned on, which I am happy with. I will try it with the always on display off to see how it lasts. With sleep mode on it drains about 10% battery over 8 hours.Update Nov. 5th 2022: With display not on always-on, then it lasts about 7-9 days depending on how much I exercise.Sleep Tracking - 10/10I am quite impressed with the sleep tracking. I don\'t have to tell it anything. It just knows that I am sleeping and tracks it. Even random naps that I take in the evening. I do not know the times I fall asleep, but it is always on the exact minute I wake up. Good job on this, and I quite like it. As for the oxygen saturation tracking, I have nothing to compare it against so who knows, it could be made up for all I know.Heart rate - 3/10Oof, this is not good and I am quite disappointed with. During the day at work and home it seems to be fine. This is good for capturing my resting heart rate which I am interested in. But during workouts it is basically useless. I have worked out 3 times with it since I got it, and it is just wildly inaccurate. The only thing it is good for is using the workout timer to count my pulse manually. While doing some spinning in the gym I consistently measure my pulse at 170-180 BPM, but this thing is measuring as low as 90 BPM to 160 BPM, usually ranging in 130-150. I can forgive being off by 10 or so BPM, but this is just wild. Once my heart rate goes about 140 or 150 it just becomes useless. It will vary by 10 BPM each measurement, vibrate warning my heart rate is not in ""the zone."" Well that sucks. I bought this thing specifically so that I could track my workout, hoping because Fitbit is a well known brand that it would do this specific thing well, and it does not.Other -I like the alarm, but I think all watches do something like that. I use the weather occasionally, and the timer is fine. I would prefer that it sets the timer, and allows me to actually start it rather than automatically starting when I lock-in a time, but that a minor gripe. The phone interface is good, and I think that it summarizes the telemetry pretty well. I also like the default watchface, and have not changed it.Update Nov. 5th 2022: I did not realize this before, but the alarm only alarms for like 20 or 30 seconds before turning off. This is fine some times, but other times I need way more effort to wake up. I have no seen a way to configure this. I would prefer that it alarms until I turn it off.ConclusionIf I can find a smart watch that is similar size, as I do like that this one is small and light, I may replace it. Mainly because of the heart rate tracking. But I am very impressed with the sleep tracking, and i like the battery life and comfort so I am going to stick with it for now. I hope that heart rate tracking can be fixed with a software update, because I do want to like this watch.', ""This is my second FitBit. The bracelet on my Alta broke, and I finally decided to upgrade. But the software for this fancier version is a bit problematic. My biggest complaint is that while on a two week trip on a ship with little wifi I could NEVER get the watch to tell the right time. There was no way to get it to work. Maddening! I tried refreshing hundreds of times, everything I could think of. So that's a real downside. The Alta was much more straightforward, probably because it wasn't trying to do as much? The sleep tracking works well as long as you have wifi, and the heart rate monitor is useful. They really need to work on their software if they want to compete with Apple. Their battery pairing device is much improved on this version."", ""I purchased this because I had the Amazon Halo band which was discontinued. Amazon refunded our money for the Amazon Halo band and I use that to purchase this watch on Prime day. So I got it at a great price. It also came with 6 months of extra features. This has so much information on the app in the watch that I absolutely love it. It's already saved me because I lost my debit card and it was able to use the watch to access my money at the ATM machine using Google wallet. I highly recommend this watch for exercise purposes and other functions. You can text on it, you can call on it, you can start your exercise on it. Many great features for the price."", 'I could tell my charge 3 was going to die soon. It started getting more lines across the screen like what happened with my other fitbits in the past. This was on sale $30.00 off so I decided to get the versa after comparing the charge and luxe. I do like that it will tell you how many more steps you need to reach your goal and the maps feature. I have had it a few weeks and it already froze. I have come to the conclusion with fitbits not to expect them to last long because that has been my past experiences. I take care of my products and it is sad to have gotten lines through every fitbit I have owned. I probably would not have paid full price for this but bought it because of the sale. Hopefully I will continue to enjoy!', 'Like other reviews have said, since Google has acquired FitBit, I have found that I don’t have as many features. I struggle to get the map after going on my walks, texts don’t really come through, and other things aren’t the same. It’s still useable and comes with Alexa if you’re into that sort of thing. I love the new screen faces, especially the Google art one because it changes each day.', ""When I got the watch I didn't check the box for Contents. My wife has the same watch so I used her charging cable. The box says to charge the Fitbit using the enclosed charging cable. I'm going on a trip alone and need my own charging cable. I opened the box again and there is no charging cable. I wish I had checked it thoroughly when I received it. Other than that, the watch is a good buyand I would buy it again""]"

As a sport watch, it has been serving me well.  Two years on, it is going strong still.  Battery last long, only need to be charge every alternate day.  Light and easy.  My previous Garmin Forerunner lasted 3 years, I have a feeling that this vivoactive would serve equivalently well or better.', 'If you\'re looking for a really good looking activity watch that you can wear to work without announcing to the entire office that you\'re an insufferable workout addict/apple fan, then this watch is a treasure. Light, wonderfully simple and affordable (S$180-220), this is the watch to set your mind to rest without breaking your wallet.I like that the watch can play/pause music, notify you of calls/messages and supports payments. While none of those features are strictly ""needed"", it does help that you don\'t have to reach for your phone for these during a workout,or even while strolling. GPS tracking is good under open air (I tested it using the pin location feature, which I quite like, I think it will be quite handy during a hike).A full charge lasts about 5 days, which is fine for me. The only downside is one more charging cable to keep track of/pack while traveling (wish they\'d used USB-C or something). Not worth deducting a star though, the watch is a treat. I hope it\'s built to last.', 'Cheapest price for both online and offline retailers. Delivery took about slightly one over weeks from USA to Singapore. It is authentic Garmin watch manufactured in Taiwan with serial numbers and able to register product through Garmin website for one year international warranty.

Battery life is around 3 hours.', ""Have been using this watch for close to a month. Though I could have chosen the latest Garmin, I thought I should get one that's easiest to use and learn. Have to admit I was tempted to get myself an Apple but thank God I am not disappointed by this Garmin. Took me a couple of days to understand most of the functions. Able to keep track of my different activities (i.e. indoor cycling, treadmill and swimming) without problems. Best part, I only need to charge this watch once every 3 to 4 days as I have the lighting turned up to the max. No problems with phone notifications too though I do not use Spotify as I workout with my phone.

Das will ich einfach nicht mehr missen und als ich die neue TicWatch gesehen habe, habe ich kurz überlegt und mir die dann doch gekauft. Bei der Farbe habe ich das neue Sandstone gewählt, weil es einfach Mal eine andere Farbe als schwarz (oder wie auch immer das im Einzelfall bezeichnet wird) ist. Ich habe bereits die Vorgängermodelle und habe mich nun auf das Upgrade gefreut. Und das hat sich gelohnt.Die einzelnen Aspekte Mal im Detail beleuchtet:Verpackung:Daran gibt es nichts auszusetzen. Die Uhr und das Zubehör sind gut verpackt und kommen in einer ländlichen Verpackung aus Karton. Die Verpackung ist stabil und sieht gut aus. Nicht zu viel als nötig und trotzdem dem Zweck mehr als gerecht. Der erste optische Eindruck, noch bevor man die Uhr selbst sieht, ist entsprechend positiv.Zubehör:Neben der Uhr liegt als Zubehör bei:- Ein Ladekabel- PapierkramZum Ladekabel:Es hat auf der einen Seite einen Standard USB-A Anschluss und auf der anderen Seite einen magnetischen Anschluss für die Verbindung zur Uhr. Das Kabel ist ca. 1 Meter lang und hat eine flache Form.Das Ladekabel ist kompatibel zum Ladekabel der TicWatch Pro 3.Zum Armband:Das Armband ist hellbraun, passend zur eigentlichen Uhr und aus Gummi. Das Armband selbst ist leicht flexibel und macht alle Bewegungen etc. ohne Weiteres mit. Das Material hemmt auch ein verrutschen auf dem Arm. Das Armband kann ohne Weiteres leicht mit anderen gängigen Armbändern ausgetauscht werden.Die Uhr an sich:Die Uhr an sich ist leicht. Das Gehäuse ist aus Aluminium (denke ich) und entsprechend lackiert und sieht hochwertig aus. Die beiden Knöpfe haben ein sehr gutes Feedback, sodass man gut mitbekommt wann ein Knopf gedrückt wurde. Einer der Knöpfe ist die Krone, welche im Vergleich zur TicWatch Pro 3 nun drehbar ist (incl. Entsprechender Funktion, z.B. zum scrollen).Um das runde Display herum ist ein Kranz mit einem schlicht gehaltenen Muster. Dieser ist nicht beweglich und rein dekorativ.Inbetriebnahme:Die TicWatch kam fast vollständig aufgeladen bei mir an. Ein kurzes gedrückt-halten des oberen Knopfes erweckte diese zum Leben. Zunächst erscheint das TicWatch Logo und anschließend kann die Einrichtung des auf WearOS basierten Betriebssystems der Uhr mit einem Tab auf den Bildschirm beginnen.Das Setup beginnt mit der Sprachauswahl. Standardmäßig ist Englisch die Sprache, aber auch Deutsch lässt sich ohne Scrollen direkt auswählen. Anschließend muss der ""Papierkram"" bestätigt werden und schon kann die Kopplung an das Smartphone beginnen. Dies funktionierte ohne größere Probleme und voll automatisch. Man musste lediglich die App Mobvoi Health zuvor auf dem Smartphone installieren, worauf man hingewiesen wird, und anschließend einen Kopplungscode eingeben. Das war es dann schon.Display:Die TicWatch Pro 5 hat eine Funktion, die mich ursprünglich zu ihrem Vorvorgänger geführt hat: Die Anzeige der Uhrzeit (und ein paar zusätzliche Infos), auch wenn das Display ausgeschaltet ist. Auch die TicWatch Pro 5 hat diese Funktion. Ähnlich wie bei ePaper Displays sind diese wesentlichen Informationen immer ablesbar, ohne dass das LED Display aktiviert werden muss. Bei Nacht muss eine Hintergrundbeleuchtung die Arbeit der Sonne übernehmen, sodass die Uhrzeit immer ablesbar ist.Batterielaufzeit:Beworben wird die Uhr mit einer Laufzeit von bis zu 80 Tagen. Das ist allerdings kein realistischer Wert. Dieser Wert KANN wahrscheinlich zustande kommen, wenn die Batterie voll aufgeladen, die Umgebungstemperatur nicht zu kalt und ausschließlich der Essential-Modus der Uhr aktiv ist. Also keine Smart-Funktionalität oder andere Funktionen abseits einer Standard Digitaluhr. Die Laufzeitangabe von 4 Tage (wenn man anfangs noch viel an der Uhr rumspielt) bis 5-7 Tage (im mittel- bis langfristigen Gebrauch) sind hier meiner Erfahrung nach realistisch. Die neue TicWatch Pro 5 hält auf jeden Fall merkbar länger als der Vorgänger. Und das Laden funktioniert, bei entsprechendem Ladegerät, super schnell. Innerhalb von etwas über einer Stunde war die Uhr von ca. 15% auf 100% geladen.Gesundheitsdaten:Vorab: ich kann über die Korrektheit der Daten nur eingeschränkt etwas sagen, da mir keine professionellen und zuverlässigen Geräte zur Verfügung stehen um die Werte zu verifizieren.Über die Apps TicAtmung, TicBlutsauerstoff,  TicCare, TicGesundheit, TicPuls, TicÜbung, TicSchlaf und TicZen lassen sich diverse Körperwerte messen und auslesen. Z.T. sind diese in den Apps redundant zu finden. Die TicGesundheit App fast aber die allermeisten Daten zusammen.TicAtmung ist eine Unterstützung zur Entspannung durch Atemübungen.TicBlutsauerstoff misst den Blutsauerstoff. Im Vergleich zur Vorversion der TicWatch ist es nun endlich möglich eine permanente Überwachung des Wertes durchzuführen. Das geht zwar ordentlich auf die Batterie, aber für eine Überwachung z.B. von Schlafapnoe ist diese Funktion zwingend erforderlich. Ansonsten lässt sich noch eine 30 oder 60 minütige Messung einstellen.TicCare dient dazu Fitness und Gesundheitsdaten mit Freunden und Familie zu teilen.TicGesundheit fasst die Daten der verschiedenen Sensoren zusammen. Z.B. Kalorien Verbrauch, zurückgelegte Entfernung oder Höhe, Trainingszeit, Herzfrequenz im Laufe des Tages, Blutsauerstoff im Laufe des Tages, Schlafqualität der letzten Nacht.TicPuls lässt einen den Puls messen und zeigt dazu diverse Auswertungen. Auch Auffälligkeiten wie Aussetzer oder unregelmäßige Schläge sollen so erkannt und davor gewarnt werden.TicÜbung ist die Fitnessapp mit der man diverse sportliche Aktivitäten aufzeichnen kann und so die interessanten Daten zu der entsprechenden Übung sieht. Die Uhr erkennt aber auch automatisch wenn man beginnt Sport zu machen und startet den Übungsmodus automatisch.TicSchlaf zeichnet den Schlaf auf und wann leichter Schlaf, Rem-Schlaf oder Tiefschlaf stattfindet. So kann man morgens ggf. sehen, ob man etwas an seinem Schlafverhalten ändern sollte oder man immernoch müde ist, weil man quasi keinen Tiefschlaf hatte.TicZen soll einen ähnlich wie TicAtmung entspannen und einen zu einer kurzen Pause anregen.Mich stört an allen Apps, dass diese bei jedem Start Abfragen auf welche Sensoren sie zugreifen dürfen, solange man einen der Zugriffe nicht erlaubt hat. Dazu zählt auch, dass man den Apps (nicht) erlaubt die Daten in die Cloud zu übertragen.Weitere Apps ohne Gesundheitsbezug sind:TicBarometer zum Messen des aktuellen Luftdrucks. In Verbindung mit den GPS kann hier auch die aktuelle Höhe mitteilen. Wichtig ist, dass die Höhe zuvor kalibriert wurde. Ansonsten zeigt die Höhe Quatsch an.TicKompass nutzt den eingebauten Kompass um die Uhr als Kompass zu nutzen.Companion App ""Mobvoi Health"" für das Smartphone:Auch hier: Jedes mal Nachfrage der Zustimmung zum Upload der Daten in die Cloud. Auch wenn diese immer wieder verwehrt wurde. Konsequenter Weise müsste dies auch nach getätigter Zustimmung jedes Mal erfolgen oder, wie im Falle einer Zustimmung, nur ein Mal. Ansonsten ist die App sehr übersichtlich im positiven Sinne und zeigt vor allem die Gesundheitsdaten gebündelt an. Sie versucht durch ein wöchentliches Ziel einem zudem zu mehr Bewegung zu animieren. Auch kann man hier kostenlose und kostenpflichte Watchfaces auswählen sowie Audioaufnahmen und Screenshots von der TicWatch herunterladen. Auch können hier, wie in der TicCare App, über TicCare andere Personen mit der App gekoppelt und verglichen werden. Am Ende also nichts, was man nicht auf der TicWatch machen könnte, allerdings Dank größerem Display deutlich übersichtlicher. Im Grunde hat sich außer dem Namen und dem Logo bei der App im Vergleich zur Zeit der Erscheinung der TicWatch 3 nichts verändert.GPS / Kompass:Neben der Fitness Apps, kann z.B. Google Maps über den Play Store installiert werden. Damit lässt sich mit der Uhr dann auch navigieren. Der Empfang ist auch in schwierigen Positionen weiterhin gut und auf wenige Meter genau.Lautsprecher / Mikrofon:Natürlich ist der Lautsprecher kein Hifi Sound, aber um kurzfristig an ein Gespräch vom Smartphone anzunehmen reicht es. Natürlich können dann die Leute in der Umgebung auch mithören war der gegenüber so daher, da das dann aus dem Lautsprecher kommt. Die Qualität ist den Umständen entsprechend gut. Man versteht den gegenüber deutlich und der gegenüber versteht einen auch gut. In ruhiger Umgebung merkt der gegenüber nicht einmal einen Unterschied zum normalen Smartphone.Bluetooth:Via Bluetooth wird die Smartwatch mit dem Smartphone verbunden. Aber auch ein Bluetooth Headset kann, z.B. beim Sport treiben, mit der Smartwatch verbunden werden. Somit kann über ein Headset/Kopfhörer dann Musik gehört oder auch telefoniert werden. Allerdings kann man das Headset dann auch gleich mit dem Smartphone koppeln…Zusammenfassung:Nach mehr als einer Woche im Einsatz im täglichen Gebrauch und einigen Tagen im Urlaub macht die Uhr einen sehr soliden Eindruck. Das große Display und auch die bessere Geschwindigkeit durch aktuelle Hardware und WearOS 4 (offenbar mit Option zum späteren Upgrade auf WearOS 5) machen auf mich einen sehr zufrieden stellenden Eindruck. Auch das neue Menü von WearOS 4 gefällt mir ebenso wie die Möglichkeit aktuell wiedergegebene Medien auf dem Smartphone zu kontrollieren (z.B. YouTube ist Spotify) ohne extra eine App öffnen zu müssen. Auch die neue Farbe gefällt mir, die ich bei der Bestellung noch als ""gewagt"" empfunden habe. Nun aber sie durchaus dezent und alltagstauglich empfinde.Ich vermisse derzeit noch eine Version mit Mobilfunk, aber die kommt ja vielleicht noch.Von mir daher auch für die TicWatch 5 Pro volle fünf Sterne!', 'Ya tenía ganas de tener este nuevo reloj de Ticwatch, Creo que es un acierto este nuevo color, que llaman Sandstone. La combinación con el color negro, tanto por la pantalla como por la parte trasera, e incluso la hebilla, hacen que la gen se te quede mirando tu muñeca. Y da lo mismo si estás en el gym o en tu oficina. En la compra o en el campo. ¡Es una auténtica pasada!El reloj está muy bien pensado. Dispone de una corona en la parte derecha del reloj, a las 3, y con ella manejas todas las funciones. Tan fácil como pulsar y girar. Dos minutos y tu haces con él.Y lo más increíble, está certificado bajo estándar militar MIL-STD 810H. Y 5 atm de resistencia al agua. Te puedes olvidar que lo tienes en la muñeca, incluso cuando estás en la piscina.En el día a día, el reloj no se nota que lo llevas, es súper ligero y nada alto. Y, además, puedes usar correas normales de 24 mm. Ya podían a aprender otras marcas. Y aunque la que viene de fábrica es muy cómoda, puedes usar la que más te guste, siempre que no sea NATO y tape el sensor.Y de pantallas, este reloj es lo más. Tiene una pantalla de ahorro. ¿Para qué quieres un reloj con una pan talla bonita Si no la ves, y tienes que cargarlo cada noche?Me mata cuando tienes que quitarte el reloj para cargarlo. Pero te dice que lo lleves siempre… al final, siempre tienes que cargarlo cuando más lo necesitas. En su primera carga el reloj se planta en el quinto día todavía con batería... es una auténtica pasada.Para ello, tienes que jugar con su pantalla de ahorro. Puedes programar el modo esencial del reloj (pantalla de bajo consumo) a las horas que quieras, así como ajustando el nivel de batería mínimo con el que quieres que se active).Y la pantalla de bajo consumo puede mostrar ritmo cardíaco, calorías, oxígeno en sangre y brújula, solo con el uso de la corona. Todo eso sin encender la pantalla AMOLED. Es increíble. Y cuando haces ejercicio, el color cambiacde acuerdo a tu ritmo cardiaco… alucinante.Ah!! Puedes pagar de manera rápida y sin complicaciones en tiendas que admitan pagos NFC. Permite utilizar la tecnología incorporada para realizar pagos sin contacto con Google Pay con prácticamente cualquier tipo de tarjetas. Olvídate de comprobar si tu tarjeta está admitida… 😉Y dispone un modo de control del estado de salud con un solo botón y en 90 segundos midiendo los siguientes parámetros: ritmo cardíaco, oxígeno en sangre, frecuencia respiratoria, nivel de estrés y salud cardiovascular. Más sencillo no se puede hacer.Es un completo acierto. ¡¡¡Sencillamente me encanta!!!', 'Este nuevo modelo es realmente espectacular. El acabado de la estructura del reloj combinado con un sutil brillo en el borde del bisel le otorgan una elegancia innegable. La luz de fondo de la pantalla se sincroniza perfectamente con el color del reloj, creando un efecto visual impresionante. Aunque siempre he tenido smartwatches en negro o con acabado en acero, al ver este modelo, me entraron dudas pero no me arrepiento ni de lejos.Además de su estética, el funcionamiento es precisamente lo que esperarías del mejor hardware disponible en el mercado. La fluidez y la rapidez al abrir aplicaciones y menús son muy buenas. Además, ofrece todas las mediciones de salud habituales, junto con características adicionales como barómetro, altímetro y brújula. La corona para navegar por las aplicaciones es excepcional en cuanto a sensibilidad y respuesta táctil.Vengo de probar modelos anteriores y ha mejorado significativamente en términos de batería, potencia y almacenamiento. La pantalla secundaria ahora muestra datos de salud y ofrece widgets para un seguimiento más completo. Con el nuevo procesador de dispositivos móviles, todo funciona con fluidez y la autonomía se ha mejorado notablemente. En mi experiencia, la primera carga duró tres días con un uso intensivo, incluso realizando actividades deportivas.El altavoz, el brillo y la calidad de la pantalla también han mejorado, ofreciendo una experiencia más inmersiva. El software se ha actualizado a la última versión, con una integración perfecta de las aplicaciones de deporte, sueño y salud propias de la marca. Esto convierte a este reloj en uno de los dispositivos Wear OS más completos disponibles en la actualidad.Destaco especialmente la duración de la batería, que ahora llega a más de 6 días con un uso normal, en comparación con la versión anterior que apenas duraba de 1 a 2 días. Además, la carga rápida permite tenerlo operativo en poco más de media hora, lo que significa que prácticamente nunca tengo que prescindir de él, incluso mientras duermo, ya que monitoriza la calidad de mi sueño.Como un usuario que ha adquirido todas las versiones anteriores de los relojes Ticwatch Pro, puedo decir que este nuevo modelo es una verdadera maravilla. El nuevo color es elegante y atractivo, superando las expectativas.El sistema Wear OS 3.0 funciona de manera excepcional en este reloj, introduciendo numerosas novedades que lo hacen perfecto para el día a día y para actividades deportivas, como la natación. La pantalla del ""modo reposo/esencial"" ofrece ahora una gran cantidad de información sobre pasos, sensores, y más, sin necesidad de encender la pantalla principal del reloj, simplemente girando la nueva corona. Esto es un gran acierto.Recomiendo al 100% su compra, dado su precio realmente atractivo en comparación con la competencia y todas las funciones que ofrece.', 'I have owned many smartwatches over the years and the best one hands down was the TicWatch Pro 3. So, when I saw that Mobvoi had brought out an upgrade to the Pro 3 I had to get it. I chose the sandstone colour watch as I really like the colour and it stands out well on formal dress as well as casual over the standard black you mostly get with smart watches.DesignAt first look you wouldn’t notice a huge difference between the TicWatch Pro 3 and Pro 5 but there are subtle differences. The watch strap has changed from 22mm to 24mm so all the straps I had for the Pro 3 I can’t re use. Also, the screen has increased in size so the I can’t use up my leftover screen protectors from the Pro 3 but these are minor issues. The rotating crown in replacement of the second button is a great addition. It allows scrolling through apps when in smart mode or in low power mode it can scroll through different tracking metrics.ScreenThe dual display from TicWatch Pro3 which I think was such a game changer is still on the Pro 5 but with some big enhancements. The low power always on LCD can now show live data for heart rate, steps, blood oxygen, calories, and a compass which saves having to go into smart mode view this info aswell as battery saving. Also, when doing a workout, the backlight will change colour based on your heart rate Light Blue - Warming up, Yellow - Fat Burn, Orange - Cardio, Purple - Anaerobic and Red if your heart rate is above 180BPM. The main OLED screen is very snappy and bright. scrolling through the different options is really quick and saw no slow down when open up all the different apps. You can see a big visual upgrade from wear OS 2 on TicWatch Pro 3 to wear 3 on the Pro 5.BatteryThe battery life on this watch is amazing with all tracking features on, notifications throughout the day and tracking daily workouts this watch lasts about 4 days on a single charge. There are alot of settings you can tweak to extend this further like the essential mode disables all smart features but still tracks steps, heart rate and sleep. The watch come with a new fast charge cable that can charge the watch up over 50% in half hour which would give you easily another day or 2 if you are in a hurry.Health trackingThere are so many different metrics this watch tracks it unbelievable, heart rate, blood oxygen level, stress levels, sleep and even skin temperature. Once you have it all setup you get notifications if it even notices an irregular heartbeat. I have even had it that after a very tiring meeting my watch let me know that my stress levels were high, and I might be de hydrated.SummaryThe TicWatch Pro 3 was an amazing watch but the TicWatch Pro 5 blows it out of the park and is a worthy upgrade. It is the best watch I have owned, and I can’t recommend this watch enough.', 'Ventajas:El modelo en color Sandstone del TicWatch Pro 5 es impresionante, tiene más textura de la que esperaba y se convierte en un reloj inteligente excepcionalmente elegante. Su artesanía es impecable y su apariencia no deja nada que desear. La comodidad al llevar la correa es excepcional, aunque tiene un estilo más orientado hacia actividades al aire libre y deportivas, lo que lo hace menos adecuado para entornos empresariales. Sería genial si se considerara la posibilidad de ofrecer correas de metal o cuero para adaptarse a diferentes ocasiones.Gracias a su potente chip, el TicWatch Pro 5 ofrece un funcionamiento sumamente fluido, sin retrasos ni sobrecalentamientos. El diseño de la corona giratoria mejora la facilidad de uso. El reloj es extremadamente ligero y, incluso después de un uso prolongado, no causa molestias ni incomodidades.Aunque no admite la carga inalámbrica, la velocidad de carga es bastante rápida. Según mis pruebas personales, una sola carga es suficiente para aproximadamente dos días de uso, lo que significa que no tienes que preocuparte si olvidas cargarlo de vez en cuando.La calidad de la pantalla es excepcional, con imágenes nítidas y una visibilidad excelente incluso bajo la luz solar directa.En comparación con el modelo anterior, el TicWatch Pro 3, el TicWatch Pro 5 incorpora nuevas características como el motor lineal, un altímetro, barómetro y brújula, lo que mejora significativamente la utilidad del reloj y proporciona más comodidad a los usuarios. Espero que en el futuro se añadan aún más características que mejoren la experiencia del usuario.Áreas de mejora:La única desventaja es la limitada variedad de correas opcionales en términos de tipos y colores. Personalmente, prefiero las correas de metal, pero la tienda oficial no ofrece opciones similares. Esto es algo que podría mejorarse en el futuro. Espero que se añadan más opciones de correas para satisfacer las preferencias de diferentes usuarios.', 'Una maravilla de producto, he adquirido todos los relojes Ticwatch Pro desde que los han fabricado, y se han superado versión tras versión. El nuevo color es muy bonito y elegante, mejor de lo que se aprecia en las fotos de la web.En este reloj, he de destacar la batería, que me dura más de 6 días con un uso normal (la versión anterior me duraba 1-2 días) y además, con la carga rápida, en poco más de media hora lo vuelves a tener operativo para no prescindir de él prácticamente nunca (lo uso hasta para dormir, ya que me controla la calidad del sueño).Así mismo, el sistema Wear OS 3.0 va súper fluido en este reloj, incorporando muchas novedades que lo hacen perfecto para el día a día, para hacer deporte etc. Practico natación, y es perfecto para este deporte que, además, ahora puede usarse para nada en aguas abiertas. También tengo que destacar la pantalla del ""modo reposo/esencial"" que ahora ofrece gran cantidad de información sobre pasos, sensores etc, sin necesidad de encender la pantalla principal del reloj, tan solo desplazándose por la información girando la nueva corona. Todo un acierto.Por poner algo negativo (que no lo tiene), es que estoy esperando a que saquen la versión con LTE para adquirirlo, pero es simplemente otra opción que espero que añadan pronto, de resto el reloj es un 10/10.Recomiendo al 100% su compra, además de tener un precio realmente bueno en comparación con la competencia, y a todas las funciones que incluye. Pruébalo, te aseguro que no te arrepentirás.A modo de conclusión, estaba dudando entre este color o el negro, pero finalmente es lo que más me ha gustado.', 'Simplemente espectacular.Se trata de un dispositivo de alto rendimiento con todas las funcionalidades posibles y con un diseño elegante.El color muy poco visto en el mercado, diseño elegante y moderno, llama la atención el ajustado peso que tiene para su tamaño. No lo notas en el día a día.La correa con un tacto soft hace que se ajuste muy bien, sin deslizamiento. Sistema de cambio rápido de correa bastante bueno.A nivel de batería es pronto para mí, pero a mis compañeros les aguanta de 3 a 4 días co. 1 hora diaria de deporte.En el uso ligado al teléfono, bastante bueno en las funciones de mensajería y teléfono, volumen alto en llamadas.A nivel de biorritmo es preciso en las mediciones, no como mi anterior huawei, si bien el propio dispositivo te avisa de que debes ajustar la correa bien en caso de no estar suficientemente ajustado.A nivel de menús y funcionamiento, rápido y con una interfaz muy intuitiva. En 2 horas sabes manejar todo de memoria.El enlace con el teléfono sencillo.A nivel de calidad del GPS, en bicicleta que es el uso que le doy, bastante más exacto que todos los que he tenido.Amplia gama de deportes a realizar en el menú.Sistema de bloqueo con pin o patrón eficiente.La verdad, aposté por esta marca sin conocerla demasiado y es muy probable que sea mi marca en adelante.', 'Een smartwatch kan nog zoveel functies hebben, maar als de batterij binnen een dag leeg is, heb je er alsnog niets aan. Daarom stapte ik eerder over van een Skagen Falster 3 (gelijk aan de Fossil gen 5) naar de TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra. Opeens hoefde ik niet meer dagelijks mijn horloge op te laden (als ik überhaupt etenstijd al haalde), maar hoefde ik pas na 3 dagen op te laden.Toch had de TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra nog wat kleine verbeterpunten. Daar hoort een nieuwe WearOS-versie overigens niet bij. De oudere versie voldeed meer dan prima. Hoe dan ook, de TicWatch Pro 5 komt met de laatste WearOS versie en nog veel meer verbeteringen.-Zo is het aantal sensoren toegenomen met o.a. een temperatuursensor, maar ook het kompas werkt nu.-Daarnaast was het energiezuinige scherm op de Pro 3 Ultra al geweldig, maar voegt de Pro 5 daar nog flink wat functies aan toe. De meest essentiële is voor mij dat ik nu ook op het LCD-scherm kan zien of er notificaties zijn binnengekomen.-Een andere grote verbetering is de trilmotor. Die was bij de Pro 3 Ultra vooral hoorbaar, maar minder goed voelbaar. Bij de Pro 5 is hij stil, beter voelbaar en geeft hij een prettige haptische feedback wanneer je het aanraakscherm of de digital crown gebruikt.-Die digital crown is overigens ook een verbetering, hoewel ik daar eerst wat huiverig voor was. Op mijn Skagen had ik ook zo\'n kroon die tevens ingedrukt kon worden. Probleem daarmee was dat de kroon behoorlijk ver uitstak, waardoor ik regelmatig onbedoeld de Google Assistent activeerde wanneer ik mijn pols boog. Dat is bij de Pro 5 gelukkig niet het geval. Met de kroon scroll je sneller door de menu\'s en bij het indrukken ga je een stap terug. Er wordt geen assistent geactiveerd.-Die assistent zit er overigens helemaal niet op. Dat kan voor sommige gebruikers een gemis zijn, maar ik ben nooit iemand geweest die a la Michael Knight tegen zijn horloge praat. Of de Google Assistent later nog wordt toegevoegd met een software update vind ik dan ook niet interessant.-Tot slot is de TicWatch Pro 5 voorzien van nieuwe processor. De Pro 3 Ultra was al geen traag horloge, maar de Pro 5 is net weer een stukje ""snapier"".Op papier is er nog een hele lijst aan verbeteringen, zoals 5ATM waterdichtheid, maar al met al heb ik vooral gekeken naar waar ik een smartwatch voor gebruik en hoe dit nieuwe horloge zich verhoudt tot mijn vorige smartwatches. Uiteindelijk biedt de TicWatch Pro 5 eigenlijk alles wat ik van een smartwatch vraag en verwacht en worden alle (kleine) minpunten van de toch al geweldige Pro 3 Ultra zelfs verbeterd. Dikke aanrader!', ""Ever since my first Ticwatch, the Pro 4G LTE one with Verizon, I've been a fan. The other Ticwatch models I've had was the E3, Pro 3 Ultra GPs and now this one, the Pro 5. I've tried other smart watches from LG, Motorola, Samsung and even the new Pixel watch, but I always come back to the Ticwatch.The first thing I really like about the watch is the color, they call it Sandstone.  Second thing is the Google Wear 3.5, which is a big improvement over the previous version. I'm still actually waiting for the Wear 3 update on my Pro 3 Ultra GPS. Third is the rotating crown, which is a huge improvement over all the other models, it's a lot easier in opinion to scroll through the watch than swiping - I'm really glad that was added.  Fourth is the new Snapdragon processor - paired with the 2GB RAM, this watch is FAST. Also has 32GB of storage which doubles the 16GB the new Galaxy watch has.Everything works as it should. All the health apps are great and this watch has awesome battery life. The main reason Ticwatches get the best battery life out of any smartwatch is from the 2 screen system they have. There's a LCD screen that the watch goes to when not using the main screen to save power.  I really like how the LCD screen shows a little more info than previous models. Also the backlight is brighter, and you can change it to different colors.My wife has never liked Ticwatches, but this one because of the color, the Wear 3 OS and the rotating crown she actually loves. So she ended up taking this watch from me lol. Now I'm back to using my Pro 3 Ultra GPS, but that's ok because it's also a good watch and I finally got her away from Samsung, which I've been trying to do for a while! My wife has always been a huge Samsung Galaxy watch fan, so for her to move away from that to the Ticwatch says a lot. Hopefully this watch goes on sale soon so I can purchase another one to keep for myself this time!The only negative thing I can think of is that there's no Google Assistant. I'm hoping that'll change in the future with an update. I know that Samsung watches didn't have it at first and then it did after an update. Other than that 1 negative thing, this watch is almost perfect. And I know it'll be better once it's updated to Wear 4 from The 3.5 it currently has."", ""I have previously had the TicWatch 2020, the E3 and the Ticwatch Pro 3. All of which I have found very good at what they do. However I purchased the Pixel Watch at launch and that has been my go to for nearly the last 12 months. This was until the TicWatch Pro 5 entered the mix !!After just a week of using the new TicWatch, the Pixel watch is now lying in the back of the drawer.The combination of better processor, bigger screen and vastly superior battery life has the new TicWatch Pro 5 as my new daily go to.Battery life has to be the biggest improvement, it vastly outweighs all the competition. This thing lasted 4 full 24hr days straight out of the box. Other watches need charging every evening so what is the point of sleep tracking if the watch needs to be on the charger ? Speaking of which, the sleep tracking feature through Mobvoi's own app is amazing. The watch is comfortable enough to wear whilst sleeping and you really do not need to worry about it running out of charge.Wear OS 3 is a great upgrade and runs very smoothly with the new Snapdragon processor and the big screen is clear and adjusts well in bright light.Google maps on this watch is brilliant with the turn by turn directions being very clear. For me this is so welcome when in unknown areas when you don't want to get your phone out whilst walking down the street.Another really useful feature I found is the built in compass, it is extremely acurate and I have been very impressed.The rotating crown is another great feature that I am starting to use more and more. Although the same feature was available on the Pixel watch I never used it because I found it inaccessible. No such problem here.A couple of other things before I wrap up. The spotify app runs really well and gives me control of any device I am casting or streaming to. I can also attest to the heart rate monitor being extremely accurate after having an issue the other evening involving the paramedics and their ECG maching which mirrored my extremely high heart rate as reported by the watch.Going forward, this is my new favourite watch and will be my daily go to from now on.Well done Mobvoi you have produced another spectacular piece of kit.""]"

But when it came to my notice the medical surveillance of Apple watch i have developed the interest but it needs to be paired only with  IPhone. I was also having iphone4 in 2013 or 14,  the OS is robust , smooth , secured but inflexible for any improvement,  even it did not allow the phone to be used as USB  drive in case of sudden requirement. I even could not correct the entered cell no if there is an intervening mistake directly etc etc. Hence i may not again purchase an iPhone as long it is inflexible. So I was searching for a equivalent watch, last year there was Samsung Activa 2 but it\'s ECG  did not get FDA approval. This year we are having Samsung watch 3 , Fitbit Sense and Apple watch 5,6 (6 SE is not having ECG). I was weighing between Samsung watch 3 and Fitbit Sense. I have chosen Fitbit Sense though both are having many similar features, especially considering battery life of sense (though it is not having wireless charging, BP , one important feature fall alert ). The gold colour was also appearing to be OK, if it is available with black stripes. However it appears that subjectively,  there is trend that golden is being used by women though both are unisex.I have purchased carbon black from Electroarena, at Rs 29900 against the listing price of  Rs 36k. I have received it with good additional package and manufacturer\'s sealed condition. It is made in Taiwan. The parameters like Heart rate appears to be accurate compared to other watches , It\'s EDA feature is yet to be assessed. It is having SpO2 and skin temperature sensor  as a average but not having option of on demand measurement , it is not yet having fall alert, at this cost and over this there is a  premium service hence 1 star reduced.It measures spo2 as a average on trend that too during in night on particular Clock face for systematic analysis . Temperature as up / downs over base value as a average on trend in night. All features are working as designed. Initially, set up  was an issue (the watch is not having any user interface initially) while downloading during set up. Phones location is to be Indian location, Charging is to be more than 50 % and put on charger , the set up was a breeze.As the warranty is not much clarified , either by seller except 10 days replacement warranty or by Fitbit india,  hence ECG function was checked (for ensuring healthiness of ECG sensor , it was enabled with a trick of xGPS & VPN at phone side it was retained till app v3.34. Hola VPN is needed to avoid self delete with v3.34.1.  It was functioning flawless. If one can afford  the cost easily,  definitely can go for it,  especially android user. It is value for money when compared to  ECG watches. Biggest concern is that our health data goes to their servers then comes to our phone app, if offline we not be able to retrieve and they have control on our data. Their OS is also proprietary . if ECG is not considered as an option , there are plenty of optical HR watches without these limitations.Update 22.12.2020 ECG report wass remaining inconclusive , watch firmware updated and ECG App updated on same day, now ECG able to provide results (as already said ECG will appear for installation only if Fitbit app is opened through Hola VPN with USA or equivalent method).Installed Clock face ""spo2 sundial"" selected light golden colour back ground at settings at Fitbit phone app, it is classic, looks real analogue  and using low battery.Update 07.02.2021Caution with step count check. I have observed that it has combination of primary hand swing and secondary without hand swing, in view this it will count and decide internally if there is change from primary mode, during this the counter  display stops there but adds all the steps as it feels suitable suddenly. For all practical purposes it is ok , but  checking it\'s accuracy is a challenge.Update on 11.02.21ECG Trick2: Open chrome with VN , log in to Fitbit account (web site) , go to dash board , go to right top corner , go to settings (gear symbol) again select settings (not sense) , it will reach to ""personal info""  or come to here in any other way.Select country as UK or US ( or any ECG authorized country, but time zone to be local e.g Kolkata)Now open fitbit app through VPN, go to account ,  go to Sense and go to apps , ECG should be available and ready to install.Close all. Now ECG app will not be deleted from the watch automatically  even without VPN.Update 25.04.21: Default strap replaced with TASLAR Replacement Stainless Steel Metal Mesh with Magnetic Closure . However the default tpu type strap is slightly more comfortable at least during sleeping.Update 01.06.2021Free premium subscription ended. Now all features are working except premium guided videos which i never used. One useful feature left out is personal ranges ( high /low graph lines  are not invisible now ) at Health Matrics which they should not have done ( I have noted those ranges for my body in excel to refer in case of doubt which is not as convenient), rarely used the premium 30 days trend which is also missing. Hence we can easily manage without their monthly subscription.Update 15.11.2021. I want to take one more for my wife, But we are in need of BP checking  frequently,  to administer a medicine, hence we have taken Samsung Watch 4 (black).  BP function is usable with installation of patched apk to watch and  BP calibration  using hospital grade BP machine. ECG also working.  But watch 4 battery is lasting only 24 - 28 hours even without always on display , this is the biggest inconvenience . Watch 4 is also comparatively difficult to wear with single hand due to strap buckle design . Watch 4 looks  inferior (subjective) when compared to Fitbit Sense.April 2022.The watch detected and alerted that the heart rate above 130 from last 10min while standstill condition with graph.

There are four post on the charger and inevitably, one of the posts retreats into the charge and is no longer in connect with the watch and the watch no longer charges.  At one point, I even purchased a thrid party charge (no doubt made by the same manufacturer) and had the same issue after only a few weeks.  It's a poor design, and FitBit should fixt it.  Other than that I like the watch, but I wish it had more apps on the phone for exercise, given the FitBit app has several, but the watch, only 3.****************************************************************************************I have been looking for a new Smartwatch for sometime to replace the Samsung Gearfit2 that stopped working some months ago.  I wanted one that worked with Endomondo (preferablly I could download the app to the Smartwatch and run from there).  Recently, Under Armour (UA) discontinued Endomondo and replaced it with MapMyFitnres and MapMyRun, both of which track Horsebacking riding, the reason I wanted to use Endomondo in the first place.  So when I saw that the FitBit Sense on their official website said it works with MapMyRun, I decided to buy it.  However, no matter what I do, I can neither get the FitBit app on my phone to connect to MapMyFitness or MapMyRun, nor can I get either of those apps to recognize the FitBit sense.  So, I cannot track my horseback riding, the main reason I bought it in the first place.  Now on the FitBit Community Forum, the only place you can get non-canned support for the FitBit Sense or app, I have been told it doesn't support horseback riding, but to track another exercise and then edit it afterwards.  What is even more ridiculous, is that horseback riding is selectable if you want to log a precious exercise, but cannot be selected to be tracked either from the FitBit app or the FitBit Sense.  And even the selection on the FitBit app, has only three options (run, walk, hike) vs the FitBit Sense, which has more, but not all of the same exercises that you can manually log into the app as a previous exercise.  It makes no sense to me that they cannot simple track all the same exercises on the app and the watch that you can enter manually, as the seem to have the built-in calculations already for calories burned based on time and distance and exercise type.  I find this very frustrating.  As for the other features, so far I am happy with them.  The battery has been great, although I haven't been using the GPS, since I cannot track my actual workouts, but have to add them in manually afterwards.  I understand the GPS can drain the battery fairly quickly.  The sleep tracker is good, but it would be better if you could link skin temp to the sleep tracker, so you could see the reason you are waking up are night sweats (menopause symptoms) as I have now concluded by looking at the two reports separately, it's likely why I keep waking up.  The skin temp tracker doesn't give very detailed timeliness either, so I cannot accurately say that I woke up at 3:20AM as a result of a spike in my skin temperature, so I am just assuming.  I think that would be useful.  I am not sure how accurate the step count is, since I have found I have already walked 500 steps before I get out of bed in the morning.  Perhaps it's the tossing and turning.  Anyway, overall as a Smartwatch it seems okay, but until I can get it working with MapMyRun, I won't be recommending to anyone else.""]"

Even though there is a lot to love about this watch, the sleep tracking and heart rate is all over the place. It says I slept 38 minutes one night and only a couple hours the other night. My daily average heart rate is way higher than usual for the days I wore it as compared to my apple watch.  Nothing has changed drastically during the times I wore it vs other days, so I know it's not life stressors. The main reason I have a smart watch is heart rate and exercise tracking and steps.  This watch tracked the steps fine, but the rest of it. Not so much.I'll update this in the future, but for now, here's my thoughts.I'm coming from an apple watch SE. I had way too many issues with the workouts constantly pausing, which was the main reason I had the watch. I don't respond to texts or take phone calls on my watch, and I had very few apps installed on it.  After all the troubleshooting and trying to remedy the issue, I decided to shelve the watch and look for a different fitness tracking watch.Tons of videos, reviews, comparisons, lead me to Amazfit.  I was nearly sold on the GTR4 or the TREX2, but I like the look of the GTR3 Pro Ltd. Edition the most. I was admittedly gunshy about the mixed reviews on heartrate tracking, which for the apple watch was solid.I decided to take a shot on this one and see for myself. So far, so good. Heartrate is about on par with the apple watch, and best of all, when I start a workout, the watch doesn't randomly auto-pause all the time.The Zepp app is pretty nice as well, tons of watch faces you could never get on an apple watch; although many are .99 or 1.99, which is fine. They have a decent selection of free ones too.The sleep tracking, we'll see how it does over time but I like the features of it already built in.I did order some new watch bands, as the black leather one it came with was nice, but I like sport bands most of the time.The watch is beautiful, fits my wrist great, not too heavy, and as you get used to it's functions, I'm quite happy so far.We'll see how it performs in the coming weeks and months, but fingers crossed we have a winner here.To the Devs...why do so many of the watch faces have both digital time and traditional clock hands...just pick one or let us remove the digital time from the classic faces."", 'Es bonito y funcional, solo le falta ser más sencillo para programarlo con el celular, la conexión por Bluetooth no es la mejor!', 'Cuenta con buenos aspectos como la duración de su batería,calidad de los materiales, el tamaño y resolución de la pantalla, pero a pesar de ello aun le faltan opciones como el uso de el NFC y contestar mensajes de las notificaciones es muy limitado su uso ya que a pesar de poder contestar llamadas no puedes contestar las de las aplicaciones como WhatsApp o Messenger, sin embargo en muchos otros aspectos es un reloj cómodo para uso cotidiano si no se es muy exigente.', ""I have had this watch for a little over 3 months. I've been impressed with its tracking abilities, accuracy and design. It's easy to use and comfortable to wear and very durable. I did have an incident where my screen unexpectedly cracked. I reached out to the company to report it, but was a few days after my warranty had ended and they honored it. I called the customer service line and someone answered and I was able to speak to actually human to get the issue resolved and a replacement watch processed. I cannot say enough positive things about this company, their product, and their customer service. High quality in all three areas is rare these days and I would definitely buy from them again. I do wish I could find a 3rd party protective case for it, just for added durability, but there doesn't appear to be any for the limited edition design."", ""I liked this watch for most of what it seemed to do.  I had no problems setting it up with the phone app and it was entertaining to swap out the varying watch faces although very few of the were customizable.  I'm in a wheel chair and it would have been nice to change the 'step' application to something else on a lot of the faces, ha.  The watch mechanics and programming all seemed great except it never recognizes when I got to sleep but the ergonomics were subpar.  The watchband only fit my wrist using the last hole and I found the band a bit hard. I think I prefer soft silicone.  The sensor array is elevated several millimeters above the back of the watch.  After wearing it a few hours I had some significant wrist discomfort.  It is a big watch and I think the back of the watch should be flush with the sensor array to avoid this.  I have to return it as I cannot wear it for long and I need to monitor my sleep."", 'I had the GTR Pro and upgraded to the Limited Edition. An excellent choice in my book. Classic looks with tone of functionality. It was worth a couple of extra bucks.', ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Great watch. Looks great and the battery life is about 3 weeks and that's with all monitoring enabled. Having alexa is really nice and making and receiving calls is great. Speaker is small but sounds good."", 'Sleep tracking graph shows the heart rate and breathing during all the sleeping cycles. You can select alerts for the highest and lowest rates.', 'The only thing I would prefer is a actual wireless charger.', 'Before buying this watch, I already had an Amazfit and I loved it because the battery lasted around a week. I was hoping to have the same at the time I purchased this one, but after using it for less than 3 months the battery lasted less than a day. When I was running it appear that my pace was higher than 47’00” and it easily get disconnected with my phone.I tried contacting Amazfit support and they asked for a few questions about my purchase. After that I reply and they never reached out again. I sent 3 more emails and I’m still waiting for an answer. I would definitely won’t buy another one.']"

I was lured by all of the cool extras they offered.  Galaxy did not offer a desktop dashboard though.  It was a dealbreaker.  Samsung Galaxy Watches blow.  I mean who is going to look at days, weeks, months and years of progress towards goals on a watch?  It was ridiculous.  I never thought to see if they had a desktop dashboard because well, it was a no brainer that they would.  I immediately, upon discovery, packed it up and returned it no matter the extras that they offered.  May suit others but it did not suit my needs.I had a Fitbit Sense for a long time.  Lost it.  Replaced it Galaxy Watch5 Pro.  Returned that.  Replaced it with Fitbit Sense 2.  This is the only fitness watch I will use and, the only fitness watch I will recommend.I read a lot of reviews of people whining about the changes from the original Sense to the Sense 2.  If you never had an original Fitbit Sense, you are going to love it most likely.If you have used an original Fitbit Sense, in my opinion, there is nothing that should make you whine over the changes.  So there is a more easily accessible button, bonus, so you have to relearn which way to swipe to find your information.  Not a big deal.  We are creatures of habit and don\'t like change.  But, I can learn new things. Why can\'t you?Fitbit provides a bounty of useful information, a massive accumulation of personal statistics.  I use a lot of the features at the gym or during physical activities.  I use the step counter to make sure I hit as close to 18k per day as I can.  I pour over the sleep information and am improving my sleep because of it. I have not confirmed accuracy of things like temperature etc etc but that doesn\'t matter because whether it is 99 percent accurate or 96 percent accurate, I am looking at trends, up, down or neutral.  As long as it is consistently accurate or inaccurate, in other words if it is inaccurate, as long as it is inconsistently innacurate is what matters. I look for trends.  I do not pay any attention to the ""feelings/stress"" features but maybe one day I will.  I don\'t need music streaming.  All reviews for every watch that offers it state there are problems with that feature.  I use many other features.  The fitbit dashboard offers a wealth of information not offered on the face of the watch because well, that would be ridiculous (Galaxy!). Please be ware, in order to utilize the complete package and all of the goodies Fitbit offers you will need to subscribe for 9.99 /  month.  You are not required but you might want to.  For me, it is well worth it.Fitbit does everything right.  The offer a sound, durable, sick-sleek watch, chock full of utilities and assessments and useful information.  And, if it\'s not useful, who wants it?  If I don\'t need it, I don\'t want it.This watch is enough for me and I don\'t even use all of the features.Go Fitbit!  I heard you were sliding down a slippery slope with competition.  You\'ve got my support!', 'Fitbit is nice watch with all important features.Many more than I use them. Things I love…..It’s slick , very light, comfortable on the wrist.Bright nice displays. Good battery life,Did not try in dip water but regular swiming, shower- holding it very well so far.One thing I hate about Fitbit ( even with Versa I had before) is that the display does not always come ON with turning the wrist. I have to turn the wrist a few times or use the side button. That feature seems very smooth in Apple Watch my wife has.', ""I purchased the Sense 2 to replace my Sense.  Overall I  am happy with it. It tracks sleep, activity, heart rate, steps climbed, stress,, and you can track food in the app.  It doesn't have some of the abilities that the sense did  such as music storage but it does still have all the features I  use and they work well for me. The  ECG feature works well but there is no shortcut for it making it difficult to find when you want to use it. I feel like the price is a bit high as well considering that it doesn't carry all the features of many smart watches in that price range but I  stayed with fitbit because I  like the fitbit app so well. I've only been using it for a few weeks but so far I am happy with it."", ""I purchased this watch primarily for its continuous heart monitoring, ECG app, sleep monitoring, plus some basic fitness like steps and stairs.It was easy to install. I was pleased to be able to turn off the GPS and Alexa which may have been good for an extra day of battery life. I was able to turn off the fitness nags. I've been running and working out over 40 years and don't need nags. I was also able to skip the Premium service since I don't want a monthly bill and don't want other nagging.There are a huge number of watch faces available. I focused only on free watch faces. One thing that wasn't clear is that apparently you can only install 6 faces on the  watch. When I found a better choice, it wouldn't install and had no useful explanation of why not. I ended up looking specifically for watch faces that included a battery indicator (surprisingly not universal!) and basic fitness figures. The hard part was finding watch faces that increased the font size of the battery % and fitness figures so they were more easily legible to older eyes.The biggest problem is with the watch band. I have a narrow wrist and bands with holes like the OEM band are never spaced in a way that fits well. So I ordered a new band that is metal mesh and uses a clamp to fix the length. That works to get a comfortable fit, but is a pain to put on. Good thing I only take the watch off once a day! So I tried another watch band that had a folding clasp, like my old watch band, and is adjusted in length by removing links. The whole process of removing links was a serious pain, requiring a magnifying ring light and great patience. And the link removal did not yield a snug and comfortable fit, just as with the OEM watch band. Back to the band that works, for now.Update. I just discovered it is possible, apparently, to get an adapter from my old watch band that attaches to the watch with pins to the FitBit clamp system. I'm hoping that will allow me to use my old watch band which was excellent.Further update:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BN1RVM5W?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsThis adapter took a long time to arrive all the way from China, but it worked perfectly. My old watch band was a 20mm band with adjustable sizing clamp and a folding clasp to take it on and off:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CY5D2LB/ref=pe_2313400_740551120_em_1p_0_lm?th=1Now I have the best of all worlds. A good watch and it is easy to put on and take off with a snug fit. I wonder why no one seems to make this style of watch band specifically to fit the FitBit?"", 'Was having AFib episodes that frightened me. Sense 2 showed me what was happening and my stress dropped at least 80% just because I could see the pulse rate in real time, get EKG’s on demand, and email them to my doctor.The little kudos from exercise has me upping my effort just from the positive feedback.Then there’s the sleep score telling me I am slightly sleep deprived - and hinted I should think about not napping, which I quit. In three weeks I feel better than I have for 10 years.I’m 86.', 'Original review: Well... This is an early review. Can\'t judge the durability of the sense2 yet.Out of the box, i turned it on, Setup was quite smooth, paired with the phone (Android) & received a software update directly. The screen has good punchy colors. The HR monitoring seems to be accurate on the normal levels (compared the reading with a BP device reading). I\'m yet to try it during exercise. ECG worked well.Some people here mentioned something about it being sluggish. I have experienced that when i swipe up to scroll down the notifications. However, swiping between tiles is smooth and snappy. Also, the watch did suddenly freeze and rebooted without a reason, once! As for the GPS, seemed that it catched the signal quickly and tried it for a short walk and the track was accurate.Alexa functions well, and the speaker is just ok.As For texting and notifications, you\'ll receive it properly and you can send short replies that are preloaded (like: yes, no, I\'m busy... etc), emojis or a voice message that is transcribed into text.Overall, I\'m satisfied with the purchase until now, but bear in mind this unit I\'ve got during the deep discount below $90. So, honestly, this is a good fitness tracker for that price range. But in my opinion, it definitely isn\'t worth that MSRP at $299 .. I\'d say this goes fairly between $90 -$120 .. I don\'t think I\'ll pay more for that.You can\'t install third party apps as of yet, you can\'t control music or anything else. Watch faces on the app aren\'t that much interesting. (You can\'t change watch faces from the watch, you need to use the app for that, which is quite inconvenient).For battery life, I can\'t comment on that. I\'ll update when I see a definite pattern. But it looks like something that will live for about 4-5 days with moderate usage.Fitbit pay was easy to setup. Google wallet and other google stuff are promised to be added in future updates, we\'ll see.Sleep monitoring is yet to be tested. But I\'ve seen on YouTube that this is a good sleep tracker, I\'ll be testing that.Update1:The HR monitoring is ridiculously off the charts during exercise... Did weight lifting and some HIT .. and it didn\'t perform well.. My Huawei band 6 was far more accurate, wore both ...If you want a fitness tracker for heart rate monitoring, look elsewhere. Plenty of bands that are actually fraction of the price and do way better in monitoring HR.Updated with another exercise session, see picture. After 40 minutes of heavy exercise weight lifting and running, pushups etc. The BP device reading 158 while the sense2 could read 77 ... Mind you, during the whole exercise it was \'below zone"" while i know very well my heart was beating twice as the sense2 is ""sensing"" ... At rest it monitors quite accurately, but whenever you do an exercise you\'ll definitely notice it doesn\'t catch even a close reading to your actual Heart Rate.• Update 2:Received the new update, now the device supports on-wrist calls, but i noticed that there\'s significant lag between when the phone rings and when the watch receives the call which is quite disappointing. Also, you can turn off display when you cover it with your palm! which is a gimmick for me but ok.  Google wallet and maps are yet to be added.For fairness, The new update seems like it managed to fix the accuracy of HR tracking during exercise (not sure if it\'s gonna be sustainable), see Fitbit app screenshot.• As for the battery, i believe it will at Max serve you for 3 and half days. I haven\'t used the GPS, always on display is off during sleep and motion to turn on the screen was also off whole days, I kept other functions on.. So, with moderate usage I think this can barely go on 4 days on full charge.• Notification texts in Arabic are displayed in some weird shapes and letters that are not Arabic, so you can\'t read any text notification in Arabic.. maybe this can be fixed in future updates.• Update 3:Now google wallet and maps are downloadable on the watch - go to the apps section on the Fitbit app and you can download them.• Main complaint, is, again, inaccurate & inconsistent HR monitoring during exercise, in one session it gets it quite accurate, on another occasion it does not. I even tried to tighten it further more on my wrist to see if this gonna make a difference, but it did not. For a 40 minute of HIT and weight lifting, it almost kept giving me a HR below 100 .. while I\'m sure my HR was at least above 140. It seems like while at rest, it catches the HR accurately, but at peaks and cardio levels it is way very inconsistent. Other functions are as advertised and no complaints.• Final Verdict, after about two months of usage, I\'ll take three stars ⭐⭐⭐ one for the inconsistent HR monitoring, one for the unreasonable MSRP and third for the limited functionalities of the app and the watch. It is more of a fitness tracker than a smart watch, but since HR monitoring is not consistently accurate, this takes a large chunk of this device even being useful as a fitness tracker...• All in all, this is more of a fitness tracker than a smart watch with inconsistent HR monitoring . So, fair price in my opinion is $100-$120 max. I honestly would never pay more for that, especially the Fitbit premium feature in the app Will require a subscription after 6 months.That\'s all... Hope this helps..', 'The gist: I purchased this watch to help monitor some health concerns and to supplement the features of my Android device. While I do like the health features, I feel the advertising puts too much focus on how helpful the watch is for maintaining a healthy lifestyle while keeping the needed subscription in the fine text.Pros:- High-quality construction: I have no doubt that the watch will hold up for years.- Fast, responsive screen: There is virtually no input delay for the interface.- Notifications: The watch screen allows for convenient checking of phone notifications (but is limited in what it can do after receiving one)- Google Maps directions are very helpful (avoid looking at the phone itself).- Battery: The battery lasts 2-3 days on a charge in my experience (using the always-on display and GPS occasionally), and charges very fast. I can get a full charge in less than 45 minutes usually.- Straps are very easy to switch out, and many inexpensive options exist to customize to your preference.Cons:- Paywalled features: Many of the most useful features are stuck behind a subscription paywall. These include Stress Management, Guided EDA Sessions, “Daily Readiness” score, Sleep Profiles, and more.- These features are $80/year or $10/month and dominate the app – two of the four navigational options are mostly or fully locked behind ads for premium.- The AI is not customizable: This one confuses me greatly – Google owns Fitbit, but the Sense 2 only works with Alexa and Alexa can control every music service EXCEPT YouTube Music. This makes zero sense to me.Neutral:- The speaker in the watch is mediocre at best. This, however, is expected for a device of this size.- You must use the Alexa app to customize Alexa settings on the watch. This not being incorporated into the Fitbit app is odd to me.', 'La pantalla se ve muy bien, el diseño es bonito y si dura una semana la pila (también carga rápido).Detecta bien el ritmo cardíaco en reposo (aún no reviso si lo hace bien cuando hago ejercicio) y la oxigenación solo te da un estimado por la mañana de cuando duermes. He notado que a veces no detecta bien cuando despierto.Las funciones de la app están bien, son buenas. Lo malo es que no se puede conectar a Spotify, WhatsApp ni se pueden hacer llamadas. Solo de puede contestar las llamadas en el reloj y ver las notificaciones de sms o mail o conectar a Google maps desde el teléfono y ver las instrucciones en el reloj.Algo que sirve como tip es que cuando te laves las manos o si te bañas con el procura quitartelo y secar bien todo, a mi me estaba irritado la piel si se quedaba un poco húmedo.Estoy conforme con la compra ya que lo que más buscaba era un reloj que me ayudara a darme una idea de cómo esta mi frecuencia cardíaca y oxigenación.', ""If you have a Sense 1, I don't recommend upgrading it to the 2 because it's not actually better. My Sense 1 was able to pick up right away when I started walking and would log that automatically. The Sense 2 barely picks up 7-11 minutes into my exercise that I'm walking, and even then I've usually been walking longer than my watch detected. If you get two texts at once, the watch only shows you one, unless you quickly dismiss the first one. But otherwise, unless you have your phone on your body, you won't know through the watch that you got two texts to begin with.So it's a good watch. It's just not better than the first."", ""I've had Fitbit watches for a number of years and this is the 4th or 5th one. They tend not to last terribly long, usually around 2 years. I purchase the Asurion warranty with each now. I bought this one with the refund Asurion sent me for the previous Sense 1 that no longer charged and was not fixable. Paired with the Premium Fitbit plan, this is a solid health tracker, not just fitness.""]"

Always texting us for everything that she needs in time and i find that it gives her a great security. The watch is easy to function, for her and she is only 7 years old. Definitely recommend this watch to any parent!', 'Summary: if you are outside of the US, don\'t buy from them. The bands broke within a couple of months, and they will not honor their warranty for international buyers who purchased from Amazon.The current state of the warranty saga: my defective watch is still with them, and they still insist on charging me $100 to replace it.I am still in the middle of frustrating email exchanges with their customer support. Parents, if you are looking for some peace of mind, take your business somewhere else.I will keep this updated until it is resolved, and the detail is as follows.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3rd Update (2023-09-16).From my latest communication with their support, at least they implicitly walked back the claim that those purchased from Amazon are used ones. That\'s good to know.Now, the argument has changed: their warranty does not cover those purchased from Amazon. This is interesting because their own website stated, which I quote here, exactly the opposite: ""TickTalk smartwatches purchased from authorized third-party retailers, including Amazon and/or Walmart, are eligible for our 1-Year Limited Warranty."" And this one-year limited warranty also extends to international buyers, as per their website: ""For international customers, you are responsible for any shipping fees, duties, and/or taxes associated with warranty claim."" Indeed, they followed this clause to the letter, so that I paid out of my pocket to ship the defective watch back to them (see my original review).Last issue: are the broken bands covered under limited warranty? My watch was purchased in Dec 2022, during the defective holiday batch. It falls into the category of ""basic hardware defect in workmanship."" On their own Facebook community page, the company announcement dated May 5th, 2023 also stated the limited warranty covers the broken bands in the affected batches, and their policy is to offer a free replacement.So my first question is, why am I charged $100 to repair a watch with a basic hardware defect covered under a limited warranty?My second question is, why does a customer here, a frustrated parent, need to spend so much time writing countless emails to communicate with a company about their own defective product? How far are they willing to go to avoid taking responsibility for their own defective products? This is pretty ironic for a product advertised to offer peace of mind for parents. I am documenting all these back-and-forths with them to show how much frustration a customer needs to go through to cover their basic rights. I hope the other parents do not need to go through the same and can find their peace of mind from some other companies.I am eager to see their reply to my points above.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2nd update of the repair saga (2023-09-13): Now the support team tells me that this watch from Amazon is not new but a used one, so they don\'t have any liability to repair or replace it. They inferred that my watch must be used because it is sold at a discount. My purchase price tag is around USD 200, which is higher than the price on their website. The Amazon receipt also states that this is a new product. I am no longer angry, I am now just curious to see how far they will go to avoid honoring their warranty. For any parents watching this, I will keep you posted.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------First update (2023-09-12): If I could give this zero star, I would do it. Now they charge me $100 to repair their faulty watch, while all within the warranty period! The worst experience ever!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The original review:In short, if you live outside the US, don\'t buy from them. The watch broke within a few months, and they do not even cover return shipping. The details are as follows:After a couple of months of everyday use, one band broke. At the time, we thought, fine, it is a kid\'s watch, and it breaks. We glued it back, and after another month, the other band also broke. In the meantime, the speaker sometimes works and sometimes does not. The watch also fails to charge from time to time, due to a poorly designed magnetic charger.After the second band broke, we googled online and discovered this is a common defect of their watches. We contacted customer service to ask for a replacement. To add icings on the top, they refuse to provide free shipping for customers outside of the US. Ultimately, we have to pay to return their defective watch.This is absolutely the last time that I purchase from them.', '*Initial Review*I ordered the TickTalk 4 smartwatch (in pink) over Christmas for my 8-year-old daughter who is becoming much more independent and participating in many after school activities. I settled on the TickTalk 4 after comparing and contrasting many features and reviews on similar products. My review is in 2 parts- The Great and Less than great- and is not sponsored in any way by TickTalk or Amazon. First picture is the replacement watch in all of its glory. Second picture is the original watch- where the face has a bubble. Third and Fourth pictures are of the band break.The Great: The overall functionality of the watch has been pretty great, given a few small things mentioned later in this review.-The battery life has been super impressive, especially given that my kiddo uses the included iheart radio and face talk features for hours on end.- Call clarity and connectivity are rock solid on both ends. The speaker on the watch gets pretty loud without losing clarity which is great.-I was also impressed with both cameras, which take nicer pictures than I was expecting from a smartwatch.- The Greeting Cards are super cute- I only wish there were more for her to choose from- but that doesn\'t stop her from sending what\'s currently available anyway.  :)- If you need a water-resistant watch, this one is it! Being from Michigan it was almost inevitable that this poor device was going to get dropped into either snow or a lake at some point. I\'m happy to say that it has survived 3+ snow dives and one trip into the shower with no damage at all!-The parental controls are super easy with lots of great features- I particularly love the Do Not Disturb mode for setting during school hours, the ability to turn of the ""power-off"" button on the watch and the ""firewall"" feature to block unauthorized numbers from calling her.- Customer Service!!! You\'ll see next that the watch I have currently is a replacement- but let me tell you that TickTalk\'s customer service is AWESOME! The response time was really fast when I messaged them through the website and when I called their support line I was greeted by a live person who was very knowledgeable and able to answer all of my questions.*I also want to say that Amazon\'s Customer service was really great helping me return the damaged watch. The whole process was 100% hassle-free and they rush-shipped me the replacement, at no charge, which came a whole day earlier than anticipated! The Less than Great: I was a little disappointed when the watch arrived, and I first opened it. There was a small flaw in the lower right corner of the screen, not a crack, but more like a bubble. At the time I said ""oh well"" since the blemish didn\'t seem to impact functionality (and because taking away a present on Christmas wasn\'t going to happen lol).- Location accuracy is a little off, but not terribly so. I often find when at home that my daughter\'s location is assigned 50+ feet away at the gas station across the street instead of the ""within 10 ft"" advertised.- Slow text messaging has been the worst problem and is my largest complaint. Even though I have followed all of TickTalk\'s suggestions on improving messaging reception, I still do not get text message notifications until much later than the message was sent, or until I physically open the app, which is sometimes hours later.  :(- FaceTalk and Group messaging can only be done with users who download the app and are approved as users. The FaceTalk feature was one of the main purchasing points for me as much of our family lives quite far away, so I was disappointed to learn that it only works if the other party has downloaded the TickTalk app. Little girl is pretty disappointed that she cannot FaceTalk with her friends who have ""normal"" video call capable devices :(  I am really hoping that they will be able to expand this feature, without downloading the app, to those who are already parent approved contacts.-The screen size is great, but the housing is a little bulky and the band could use quite a bit more flexibility.-I expected this to be a little more ""Kid-Proof"" as advertised. After a month of normal use the watch band broke off as she was putting it on. The location of the break was on an area of the housing, which wouldn\'t allow for a simple band replacement. Based on other reviews seen on both Amazon and the TickTalk website, this seems to be a manufacturing issue that I believe could be fixed by creating a pivoting joint instead of the band being fixed directly to the unit. I contacted both Amazon and TickTalk regarding this issue and both were amazing to work with- immediately offering to replace the watch.Overall- this has been a great product and I wouldn\'t hesitate on purchasing again, even with some of the flaws. Being connected and knowing that she is safe in so many ways has made this purchase more than worth it. Thanks for the peace of mind TickTalk!*Initial Review Above; The following addition is the 2nd addenda of this review to replace misinformation. All misrepresented information has been redacted.- This edit is posted to the bottom of the initial review, as my original thoughts/feelings about the TickTalk 4 smartwatch remain unchanged and should be the true considering factors for making this purchase.  :)Well, I need to add this edit my review. The replacement TickTalk 4 smartwatch from Amazon lasted ONE wear before the band broke at the housing in the same spot as the last one. I called TickTalk customer service directly this time and was assisted by *Nora (aliases used for privacy purposes as I forgot to ask permission to use their name in this review). *Nora advised me that since my last issue (2nd broken watch band/housing), Amazon has been notified about the faulty product batch received/sent out over the holiday season and that they (Amazon & TickTalk both) have since pulled the defective watches associated with this issue. I have also been assured that Amazon has since replaced the faulty batch with verified defect-free products. In addition to my call, I also received an email from *Tory, the Customer Service Manager at TickTalk who clarified some previously misrepresented information (from my perspective understanding, not their fault) and further assuring me that this issue has been corrected. I cannot express enough how impressed I am with their customer service taking the time to reach out, instead of waiting to react. Kudos to Amazon and TickTalk for being so understanding, helpful and WILLING (wish I could bold and double underline this as it is so uncommon these days!) to correct this issue for their customers with no hassle.I remain 100% completely impressed with the stellar customer service that TickTalk has provided, *Nora particularly, as well as their continued support in resolving this issue with a new, verified defect-free watch at no expense- including shipping costs. I was emailed a return label within 24 hours of my call and am excited to receive the new watch in the coming weeks. Once I have received this and verified for myself, I will update my star review to its original 4 status.  :)Here\'s to hoping that the third time is the charm!', 'I bought the phone for my granddaughter and spent several hours setting it up and learning all of the features of the phone and the parental control app. Set up was a bit frustrating but not unusually so for this type of device. I eventually completed the setup, choosing the Basic Plan, and successfully paired the watch with my phone and then my wife\'s phone. Initially, the location tracking was off by hundreds of miles, but customer support promptly fixed the problem with an adjustment on the GPS server side. I\'ve had no other major issues, but I\'ll discuss a few minor issues.Location accuracy is not everything I expect from a GPS device, but it works as advertised. Apparently, the location is often based on nearby public wifi rather than the location of the phone itself. I don\'t know if that\'s usual for GPS devices, but my phone seems a bit more accurate. The reported location is within the 100 or so feet advertised in the urban/suburban settings I\'ve tested, and I\'m happy enough with it, but I wonder whether the tracking feature works in a remote setting far from any public wifi router or cell tower. Would it still track the location every ten minutes even if I can\'t monitor it from the app? I haven\'t tested.My first test of the location history feature seemed to fail, but the documentation warns that the route history feature only enables after a long enough history is accumulated. I took the watch downtown and skated around to test and found no history an hour later, but the history did appear the next day. I assume that recent history will now appear in the app more rapidly, but I haven\'t retested it.Battery life with modest use seems to be a day or so, but I expect my granddaughter to stream music and use facetalk much more than I have, so I\'m not sure it\'ll last a day. The phone\'s screen dims and then turns off to save the battery, but the timeout can be frustratingly rapid. I enabled both battery-consuming features, continuous location tracking, and continuous wifi connection. Reestablishing the wifi connection automatically affects battery life significantly if the phone loses wifi frequently, but I also have facetalk limited to a wifi connection to save on data, so the tradeoff seems worth it. The snap-on charger works well, but my granddaughter will likely lose it if she carries it with her, so the optional charging stand seems a good investment (or a good reason to write a review).The display is difficult to read in bright sunlight. The difficulty is not unusual so for this type of device, but it\'s more acute because the screen is so small. I can\'t read the watch face outside without finding a shady spot. I don\'t fault the manufacturer, but it\'s worth noting. The watch face is analog and has no digital readout of the time (as in ""11:49 AM""). My aging eyes prefer a digital readout.I have significant trouble using the alpha-numeric keys to enter a wifi password. Specifically, pressing Caps Lock to enter an upper case character is very frustrating because the key is so close to the edge of the watch or because my fingers are too fat or both, but I finally managed to do it. I dread using this keypad, but it seems to be used only for wifi passwords. Would be nice if I could set up a wifi connection from the parental control app.I started searching for a location tracker because we\'re taking our granddaughter on a trip to Europe next month. I wasn\'t looking for a phone initially, but TickTalk quickly won me over. Unfortunately, the Red Pocket SIM card only works in North America. I will investigate using a different SIM card and mobile service plan temporarily, but it would be nice if I could pay for temporary, European coverage using the Red Pocket plans. I haven\'t asked customer support about this possibility yet. If I don\'t find a solution, I may also try Apple AirTag, but I don\'t regret buying the phone.The phone pairs easily to my Bluetooth earbuds, but my granddaughter would lose them. She has larger headphones, but they\'re wired. A headphone jack would be nice, but I understand the size constraint.Overall, I\'m very happy with my purchase and have no trouble awarding five stars. I\'m tempted to ask TickTalk if they\'ll offer a version for adults. The price of the Basic Plan is unbeatable.', ""OVERVIEW: I purchased the TickTalk 4 for my son's 9th birthday. He absolutely loves it. It is the only thing he makes sure to have with him at all times. He makes sure to put the watch on charge every night, something he doesn't even do with his tablet! The hardware is ok, could be more durable, the tracking features could be improved with a simple firmware and app update (see more details about that below). Superb customer service makes up for the shortfalls of the product.THE PRODUCT: The watch could be made a bit more durable. The plastic body is a little too brittle and can break where the band attaches and the glass should be made of Gorilla glass or similar hardened glass that is used for mobile devices. The GPS tracking is hit or miss. The watch prefers to use WiFi access points for location information over GPS satellites or cell tower location which is much more accurate than WiFi location. WiFi location depends on the internet access company providing accurate location information for that IP address. If your WiFi provider is located in another state or city, it is possible that that's what the location will be. The company says that this is so the watch conserves battery. I wish we had a choice in the settings to make it more accurate or conserve more battery. For me, and I'm sure most parents thinking about buying this watch, accurate tracking is a higher priority over longer battery life. That said, the battery life is very good, it will last two days on a charge. Personally, I would rather have to charge it every night to get more reliable location tracking. I'm sure TickTalk can change this with a firmware and app update, just make it an option in the settings, let the customer choose. The other features are very good and well thought out. However, the text message notification on Android devices is not very noticeable. Several times I have not noticed that I had received a net message until hours later. In order for the security features to work properly, the messages have to go through their messaging system, and I like that, however, message notification suffers because of it. The messaging system is contained within the app, it does not use a regular text messaging app.  so your phone treats notifications as app notifications, not message notifications. Which in Android, are two different types of notifications and app notifications are lower priority and lower visibility. I can't speak to iOS devices as I don't use those. Hopefully, TickTalk can make a separate app just for messaging, that should solve the problem.THE CUSTOMER SERVICE: My son broke the watch two times, the plastic body and then the glass. He was devastated each time because he knew that we could not buy another watch for him. I contacted customer service to see what my options were and that's when I found the BEST part of this company. Despite the short comings of the product, it is the customer service that will keep me coming back! They are so helpful and eager to solve any problems, I can not speak more highly of this team! Each time they replaced the broken watch and made my boy smile again! My daughter will be old enough for a smart watch soon and when it is time, because of the customer service, I will be back to purchase from this company again! I just want to state it again, DUE TO SUPURB CUSTOMER SERVICE, THIS COMPANY HAS EARNED A REPEAT CUSTOMER!Also of note; they sell an extended warranty (two years extended plus 2 free replacements for $30) but you have to buy the watch directly from their website, you can't purchase the extended warranty if you purchase from Amazon. However, the standard warranty is exceptional (mostly due to the customer service team) and is fully honored when you buy on Amazon."", ""I wanted this watch for my 11yo as a secure gps locater/ phone with parental controls. It's ability to deliver on these points is mostly dependent on the network ability of the carrier. Despite choosing the carrier with the best coverage in my area, cell service was super spotty and did not actually work well in the watch.  Switching carriers helped, but there are still some annoying issues (see below if you like that sort of thing).Overall, I think the watch will still be a good choice for us for the next few years. But, due to the potential for connectivity issues and/or lengthy setup process, do not plan this watch for a present like a birthday or Christmas so that you don't needlessly run out the clock on your 30 days for a free return with the watch sitting wrapped up in gift paper for part of the return window.PLUS: Customer service is real live people who answer the phone quickly and seem intelligent and pleasant. That is a real plus.PLUS: You can select that streaming content is only available when on Wifi. That's a nice option since we chose the 1GB data plan for $9.99 and definitely don't want the chance for overages.PLUS: podcasts are available!PLUS: The voice quality is great, especially considering that it's essentially on speaker phone.MINUS: The phone did not work straight out of the box. Despite choosing the T mobile plan (which I selected since their website indicates I am in an Ultra Capacity area), the phone had difficulties with friends and family or even parents getting through. I was advised this is a carrier issue and was sent a new Sim Card to try another carrier.MINUS: If a caller can't get through to the watch, there is a prompt to leave a message and then it seems that you can leave a recording. However that message won't get sent to the watch. Annoying!MINUS: If I am on the phone and my child calls me from his watch, sometimes it will ring busy for him AND SOMETIMES IT WILL NOT RING ON MY END. This is the most annoying dysfunction. I want to know my child is calling me, that is literally the entire point of him having the watch in the first place.MINUS: After my first Customer Service call, I never received the first replacement Sim card. After waiting for it for almost 2 weeks, I called back and they sent a different one.MINUS: Since I ordered the watch a week before my sons' birthday, then I tried figuring out what was wrong with the watch for a week, waited almost two weeks for the first replacement Sim and 4 days for the second replacement Sim, now I have only one day before my 30 days for a free return are up to decide if the new Sim card on the ATT Network is working.MINUS: If you get a new sim card, the phone number changes. Really annoying to not have this info shared by customer service ahead of time. Annoying to update all the family and friends. Also my child had already memorized his number, now he has to re-learn a new one.We have one day left to decide if we want to return it, but I am thinking that despite the issues, the advantage to us to have a watch phone with parental controls outweighs the annoyances and we will end up keeping it. Hopefully we will grow to love it."", ""I had been debating getting my son and daughter (10 and 7) some kind of non-phone communication device / gps tracker. I was thinking I'd just disable access to the browser on a cheap Apple Watch, but a) it's not that straightforward and a smart kid can circumvent it, b) Apple decided that only Series 4 or later can share with one iPhone, and c) I suddenly realized that silly decision by Apple made me have to buy 2 Series 4's, and that was not in my budget, especially for a 7 year old.So I did a ton of research. I looked at quite a few watches and was finally torn between the TickTalk4 and the CosmoJr2, so I bought both as a comparison. I gave my older kid the TT4 ($160 + $24 / mo) and the younger the CJ2 ($60 + $15 / mo if you buy the annual plan). Honestly, the results were very interesting.Please look for my review of the CJ2 under that product. I don't want to take up space here reviewing another product, but the short of it is, CJ2 is pretty easy to setup, works as advertised, and after ironing out a few nonsensical setup instructions my younger daughter was able to start bugging anyone I put in her contacts with phone calls at 6am (I didn't know). So it works, and it's easy for a child to figure out. Also, the battery and the speaker are good. What I didn't realize is, there is NO video calling (like FaceTime). Hmmm... don't know why I didn't see that prior to purchasing.So the TT4 is by far the superior product. It has more features and is closer to a real phone than the CJ2. It does have video calling and it works surprisingly well. The calls are crisp, and big bonus, you get a bunch of stories, songs, and other child friendly content (like Avatar: Last Airbender and SpongeBob) as radio podcasts.That said, the amount of time it took to set it up... let's just say if you want to give your kid a working watch/phone, you'll need to set aside at least an hour. I'm a software developer (videogames) so I know the importance of guiding a person through complex setups, and overall I'd say TT4 does a reasonable job. However, they don't set your expectation early on about the following -- you don't realize you have to setup an account for the watch, an account for the parenting app, and an account for the cell service. While I understand because of the unlocked nature you can't include the cell service in my next point, the account for the watch should have auto populated the parental account and vice versa. The fact that you had to do it twice essentially meant you must do it 3 times. This can be torturous, especially if you do it in the wrong order.Setting that aside, the watch is actually quite good. It hits the sweet spot of features vs functionality, and it removes my worry of my kids surfing the internet, etc... it also uses a simple authentication scheme to allow or not allow people to call your kids. There's plenty online that reviews each feature, it suffices to say the watch does what it advertises and does it nicely.I still have two issues to deal with: 1) the volume on the speaker is incredibly low, almost silent. I've tried everything and can't fix it, so I've reached out to their tech support. I'll update this review once they contact me and rate their response and the outcome here. I just hope it's not a faulty speaker because I don't want to go through that setup again, and 2) the battery life has to be carefully managed. With everything turned ON, the watch drained to 50% within 4 hours, which means basically an 8 hour battery life. Now, you really don't need everything on, so I'm sure it will last 12. Given what it's doing (the gps is likely the largest drain, but that's the thing you don't want to turn off) I guess the battery endurance isn't terrible, but it's not great.Finally, the pricing for the cell service is a bit misleading. They say $10 a month in the literature, but in fact that's for a 1000 minutes only, which is just so year 1990, right? If you want unlimited data/text/and service it's $20 per month. Not a lot compared to my cellphone's service, but it's double what they say, and I guess I'm annoyed about that. But CJ2 isn't much better... all their prices require an annual payment upfront. So I'm probably just annoyed.Overall, a good watch. If you're wondering which I'd choose between the two I compared, I think the TT4 is a better solution in terms of safety, features, video calling, and other features missing from the CJ2. But, I could've bought 3 CJ2s for the TT4, and I do take that into account. In the end, I think you get what you pay for.It's not an Apple Watch, which will make the experience and your appreciation horribly skewed if you go into this expecting that. But if you temper your expectations and realize this is just a way for you to track your kids' location, contact them via voice, text, or video calling, and give them and you hope in case of an emergency, you'll appreciate the design and execution of the product. It's IPX67, so splashes are ok, but no submersion which means not at the pool. Keep that in mind.Summary: A solid watch for our youngins. I'd recommend buying it. Hope this helped your decision. :)""]"

Reluctant to switch brands initially, I found the Garmin to be a superior product, offering not only similar features but also a greater level of durability. This goes above and beyond as a fitness tracker, providing an extensive range of features that enhance both my workout routines and daily life. It boasts an accurate GPS tracking system, enabling me to monitor my outdoor activities with precision. Whether I'm running, cycling, or hiking, the vivoactive 4 consistently delivers reliable data regarding distance, pace, and elevation.Furthermore, this device seamlessly integrates with my smartphone, allowing me to receive notifications for calls, texts, and other important alerts. The ability to stay connected without the need to constantly check my phone has proven to be incredibly convenient, especially during workouts when I don't want to be distracted.One aspect that truly sets this apart from other fitness trackers is its exceptional durability. Having used Fitbit devices in the past, I noticed a significant difference in the build quality of the Garmin. The vivoactive 4 is designed to withstand the rigors of an active lifestyle, making it an ideal companion for fitness enthusiasts and adventure seekers alike. Its robust construction ensures it can handle various environments, including harsh weather conditions and accidental bumps.It features a user-friendly interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate. The touchscreen display is responsive and provides clear visibility, even in bright sunlight. The menu layout is well-organized, allowing quick access to various features and settings. I appreciate the simplicity of adjusting settings, creating personalized workout profiles, and tracking my progress effortlessly.Another notable aspect I love is its impressive battery life. With regular usage, I found that the device can easily last up to 7 days on a single charge. This extended battery life ensures that I can rely on it for extended periods without worrying about constant recharging.While the Garmin vivoactive 4 excels in many aspects, one feature that is noticeably absent is the smart wake alarm. Fitbit devices offered this convenient feature that gradually wakes you up with gentle vibrations, when you are in light sleep. Although the vivoactive 4 lacks this specific capability, its overall performance and durability more than compensate for this minor drawback.Overall, the Garmin vivoactive 4 surpasses my expectations as a fitness tracker, proving to be a worthy replacement for my Fitbit Charge 5 device. With its extensive range of features, durable design, user-friendly interface, and impressive battery life, the vivoactive 4 has undoubtedly elevated my fitness journey. While the absence of a smart wake alarm is a minor inconvenience, it does not diminish the overall excellence of this top-tier product. I highly recommend the Garmin vivoactive 4 to anyone seeking a reliable and durable fitness tracker that goes the extra mile."", ""I had a Garmin smart watch for a few years and was very happy with it. So much so I ordered another one because my Garmin 4 died. I ordered the Garminactive 4 which is what I thought I had but it was the wrong one. I had to return it because I have very small wrists and the band on the watch kept moving and rubbed sores on my wrist.I ordered the Garminactive 4s. What is the difference between the two:--The Garminactive 4 battery is supposed to last 8 days; the 4s lasts 7 days in Smartwatch mode--The Garminactive 4 in GPS has 18 hours and in GPS music has 6 hours but the 4s has 15 hours and with GPS with music 5 hours.--Both have sensors that monitor Heart rate, accelerometer altimeter, compass, gyroscope, Pulse Ox, thermometerOf course there are a few more differences but are basically the same. If you are active and require the GPS with the monitoring, your battery life isn't going to be that great. You will be charging the watch more often.. The charging time is reasonable. I charged my watch every day or every other day when I was watching television and it worked out for me. My experience has been -- Turn off the GPS and don't play music and your battery life will be greatly improved."", 'Muy buen diseño, tamaño, correo evita que se caiga, buena duración de batería pero el GPS la consume muy rapido como ellos mismos advierten así que todo bien, en segunda mano como nuevo es muy muy buena opcion.', 'I\'ve tried several smartwatches and finally found the one for me with the Vivoactive 4!I started with Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 - terribly short battery life and very slow charging. Tried Amazfit GTR 2 - nice but couldn\'t get past being tethered to China, and poor app. Fossil Hybrid HR - beautiful to look at, buggy and inaccurate. With Garmin I tried the Venu 2: beautiful screen and great features, but annoyingly buggy, and with erratic battery life. Vivomove Style - worked fine but small and just not enough good features.This is the one. Sometimes I\'ll compare/contrast Vivoactive 4 (VA4) with Venu 2 (V2).Pros:-Just about the right shape and size and weight for me. Looks nice; I originally wanted the black but the shadow gray/silver bezel was $50 cheaper. I like the silver bezel, looks classy, and I\'m happy with it.-Interface smooth and easy to use. Different from the Android-like style of Samsung or Amazfit but easy enough in its own way. No lags. Decently customizable. Decent app selection in the store.-Touchscreen works really well; responsive when I actually want to use it, but rarely picks up accidental touches, or wiping it with my sleeve. (V2 was terrible for accidental touches and always activated when trying to wipe it off.)-Great fitness features for general casual fitness (probably not for pro athletes). Good GPS for hiking (under the Walking activity). Lots of good motivators to be active, and tons of metrics even just for normal daily use.-Excellent battery life, good for a week without GPS activities. GPS uses ~10% per hour, still good. Charges in a little over an hour. (V2 charged even more quickly, but battery life was erratic, and far shorter with always-on display.)-Good selection of watchfaces, stock and third-party.-Transreflective display - I wasn\'t sure about this, but I\'ve come to really like it! It\'s certainly not as ""pretty"" as AMOLED like on a Samsung or the V2, but much more practical, and far better battery life. AOD 24/7 for a week straight, backlight only needed in the dark, very clear and easy to read in sunlight - a much better choice for a fitness-focused watch in my opinion. Very happy with it! (The AMOLED AOD on the V2 was my main problem with it, other than general bugginess. It sapped the battery like crazy. It also couldn\'t be turned off quickly on the fly, like for a movie or a nap. Not a problem on the VA4!)-I like Garmin Connect. Pretty easy to use and lots of info.Cons:-Transreflective display - I like it, as noted above, but it takes some getting used to at first after AMOLED, and will never be as ""pretty"" except in bright sunlight which is where it really shines (literally).-Slightly thicker than I might prefer.-Plastic build, other than bezel. I don\'t mind and it\'s sturdy and light, but it doesn\'t say ""premium.""-Occasional problems getting a GPS lock after traveling to a new location. It helps to sync and then restart the watch.-Connect IQ, the app store, is poorly organized and has a lot of junk in with some gems. Looks like the Android Market 10 years ago.-Sleep tracking. For me this is the major con, especially compared to the V2. Accuracy is only okay, sleep and wake times decent, but sometimes missed when I\'m in bed awake, or even got up to go to the bathroom. No sleep score and no insights, and can\'t view sleep on the watch. Sleep tracking is where the V2 really excels by comparison - impressively accurate, and very helpful sleep score and insights, onboard calculation and widget... the V2 outstrips the VA4 by miles here. I really, really wish Garmin would bring the updated sleep tracking to the VA4 as a firmware update. Or a VA5. I\'d buy it!Aside from the lackluster sleep tracking, I\'m extremely happy with the Garmin Vivoactive 4. It\'s (almost) everything I want from a fitness/smartwatch. If Garmin brought the better sleep tracking to it, I\'d say 5 stars, solid. As it is, call it a strong 4.5, and the best available for my needs.', 'My Fitbit lasted 8 months, customer service replaced the unit and 8 months later it died too. Customer service said it was outside of warranty period, which I guess doesn\'t reset with the replacement, so I went looking for a new device. The transition from Fitbit to Garmin took a week or two to get very comfortable but now I am all in with Garmin. The app is great, building and syncing custom HIIT workouts is my favorite. I am a big guy with big wrist (8.25"" or 210mm) and it fits on the 4th hole which is just enough to tuck the tag end under the loop, see photo for a visual explanation. The customizable watch faces has really helped my older eyes. About 2 months in I am finding the battery to last about a week, and it recharges from 10% to 100% in about half an hour.', 'Battery life is extended by shuting off trackers.  With only heart rate and sleep tracking, 5 days between charging is reasonable.  ""Broadcasting"" heart rate to a cycling computer 2  to 4 hours a day doesn\'t have a noticable impact on battery life.  Using GPS is reported to drain the battery in 12 hours.  I haven\'t tested this feature for that long to comment.I use this watch primarily to send heart rate to a cycling computer and as a time piece.  After comparing it to a chest strap, I found the watch must be very snug on the wrist to detect heart rate above 120 to 130.  When snug, the watch is comparable to a chest strap monitor.  The cycling computer converts heart rate to zones which I use for monitoring workouts and race phases.As with most ""smart"" devices, the font is too small for data readouts on the watch face.  These devices must be developed and tested by people too young for reading glasses (presbiopia).  Options for LARGER fonts would improve this device.Data is sent to the Garmin moble app.  Documentation is slim and takes some experimenting to find and understand the collected data.  I had to ask the chat bot how to send heart rate data to the cycling computer.  Something this basic should be in the documentation.', 'I owned the Garmin vivoactive 3 for almost 3 years.I am an avid runner, running about 110km a week, and I really liked the vivoactive 3.I only had 2 complaints: misrable battery life, and the lack of support for music.Thankfully, the vivoactive 4 addresses both of fhese issues.It has much better battery life and support listening to music.I also love the bigger display and the addition of a new button dedicated to the ""back"" operation.All in all it is a beautiful watch with tons of features for anyone with sport activity in mind and I strongly recommend it.', 'This is my third garmin watch.  I broke two forerunners on the watch where the band attaches.  The watch still worked but was useless not being able to attach the band.The band on this one attaches traditionally with  Pins.  I love the watch with many more features than the forerunner.  I am still getting used to the touch screen.  I just picked this up on prime day at a good price.  I would buy it again.', 'Great for viewing if you have trouble seeing digital display in the sun.', ""I liked the watch and the interface, however the step counter does not work if you don't swing the arms. Compared to my Fitbit it was 60% less. I called customer support and they told me that the watch uses the arm movement to count steps. Since I push my golf cart, it does not accurately count the steps. The GPS works great and I also liked that I can download golf courses. The steps are an important feature, I have decided to return the watch and go back to a Fitbit.""]"

C'mon for all you're getting, and you think it's expensive, you obviously didn't do your research on the competition at all...Its a solid buy and for all you're getting worth every penny (even if you've already saved by getting this watch)! Just go for it!"", 'Still has some random reboots but a lot of software updates recently so hopefully that fixes it.', 'First and foremost, I use iPhone and I own a Apple Watch Series 3.  Therefore, any smart watch I look at must compare to that combination.  I also think that Apple Watches are ridiculously over priced for the functionality they provide.  Next, the battery life for a $400+ Apple Watch should be more than 24 hours - I think it is criminal that Apple cannot conceive of a design and OS that can make the battery in a 44mm watch last longer than one day!  My ""smartwatch"" journey actually began with Fitbits several years ago.  But there was always connectivity or sync issues between the Fitbit and iPhones.  My wife still wears a Fitbit, but she still has connectivity issues - even with the latest version of Fitbits.  I also tried the Samsung, Garmin, and others - and again similar situation.  Connectivity issues, especially with the Samsung, that would cause the watch to forget it is attached to my iPhone.  This was especially true when I would leave my cell behind to run to the mailbox and when I got back I would have to re-setup the watch to my iPhone.  I also did not want to pay another $200+ for a watch, I wanted something cheaper.  So my requirements for this watch looked like this:- Less than $200- Designed for the outdoors (walk, run, hiking, swimming, etc)- Integrates well with iPhone- Get all notifications consistently- Do not need to make or answer calls on my watch- Do not need to make text responses on my watch (my responses are usually more than three letters or an emoji)- Battery life longer than 24 hours.Seems pretty straight forward, but Fitbit, Samsung, Garmin have all failed miserably at this simple list of requirements.  I found the Amazfit T-Rex last year and my initial thought was it was a cheap Garmin knockoff that will not perform any where near as good.  For me, nothing could be further from the truth.  I got this a few days ago as a present, because I refused to spend the $130 on something I was convinced was a waste, even though it had some really strong reviews on Amazon and on the web.  Here are my impressions of the watch thus far:Initial Day:The box the watch came in made me feel as if I had bought an Apple Watch - it was that good.  Well organized and familiar.  The watch reported a 61% charge on it when I took it out of the box - so I began the setup.  The QR Code setup was both fast and easy with the iPhone.  I had already downloaded the Zepp app from iTunes so my iPhone was ready.  As with most electronics, the watch spent the first hour or so downloading and installing updates and other things - again, zero effort on my part.  The usual questions about allowing location services, integration with Apple Health, etc. were next.  Then the watch was ready to go!  I played with the watch and the app for the next few hours.  I will say that the software is not the most intuitive design.  I found settings, then wanted to go back and forgot where they were and couldn\'t figure out how I had gotten to them in the first place.  That for me is the biggest complaint about the watch so far... and that is pretty good considering everything else.  The watch was down to 54% by the time I had stopped playing with it, so I decided to put it on the charger and see how quickly it charged.  It went from 54% to 92% in under an hour.First Full Day:So the next day was going to be the first full day test.  It starts with the sleep function, When I went to bed the watch was at 87%, when I woke up - it was still at 87%.  I then went for my morning walk and used the walking feature to monitor it.  The watch did fantastic!  Did everything I expected and when I got home to review the walk in the app, I was extremely happy with the reporting.  The app excelled in this area, its UI reminded me of the Garmin.  Tracking my pace every inch of the way.  Heartrate, distance, direction, everything you could want - it was awesome.  This is where it basically left the Apple Watch behind.  Next, notifications - this was an area of particular concern for me because this is where non-Apple products tend to fail.  I got every single notification, phone, text, email, apps - everything.  Never missed a beat.  After a full day of pings from email, calendar, etc. my battery had dropped to 84%.  I had lost only 3% battery in a full day.  If this was my Apple Watch, it would be on the charger right now.  Based on just this alone, I calculated that I should get about 34 days out of a single charge - AMAZING!!!  I will continue to test the watch and update to see if my prediction holds true, but so far this has been the best ""smartwatch"" I have ever owned.UPDATE #1Ok, now I have own the watch for over a week.  The honeymoon phase is over and I have tested in various scenarios to see what the implications.- Always OnLike all watches of this type there is a ""Always On"" option.  However, I found this one to be disappointing.  The watch face is not the primary - it seems to be a watch face just for always on, which I do not like.  I want it on all the time with the watch face I have set, not showing something else.  So for me this is not as good as my Apple Series 3.- Wrist Lift ActivationAgain, like ""Always On"" - there is an option that as you lift your wrist, it activates the watch.  This works, but not as expected.  On my Apple watch it worked, but sometimes required a double lift to make it activate.  The T-Rex is super sensitive, even for normal settings.  As I drive and I turn the wheel, it activates; if I watch briskly, it activates.  So it is a bit too sensitive and with that comes battery drain.  Based on the usage in the first few days I expected a 20+ day battery capacity.  This feature on normal setting knocks it down by half - so now 10+ days.  Which is still huge in comparison to Apple.  But something to consider if the longest battery life is a goal for you.- NotificationsThis was an area of huge concern for me considering this is not Apple or Android based watch.  I am happy to report that all the notifications work the way i want.- FunctionalityI am still extremely pleased with the functionality of the watch.  I believe you will see several pros/cons on the accuracy of things (like sleep, hear rate, etc.).  I have found that it is good, but not the most precise device in the world.  If precession is your focus, then you should not have an expectation of spending less than $200 for it.  For this watch I am going for the 90/10 rule - being that its 90%+ accurate; and for me it has been 90% accurate for all the things I have been looking for: sleep, heart rate, pace (walking/running), activity level).- Software / UII am still find this to be a quirky and somewhat confusing.  I think there are several opportunities to improve, and as they sell more products, I think this should improve - or it better!  :)So overall I would give this a product a 4.5 out of 5 due to the software/UI issues.  The watch itself performs as advertised and meets all my needs.', 'For some perspective, I have been wearing Apple Watches since the day they came out. I also recently decided to try a $700 Garmin smart watch. I can\'t even say ""for the price"" (because I don\'t want people to think that this product is cheaply made, because it is NOT)... my first impressions of the #AmazFit T-Rex 2 are outstanding! I have had it about 18 hours so I will know a lot more in the coming days, but I am so impressed with some of the things they got right that I had to jump on and write a review immediately.So... the strap is incredibly comfortable and has MANY slots with small increments so you can find just the right fit for you. I had struggled with this with so many Apple Watch bands over the years. Also, the watch it incredibly light weight but has enough ""bulk"" to make it feel like a man\'s watch and it feels durable. Time will tell on the durability.The screen is incredibly responsive and bright enough to see in bright sunlight. I\'ve only had a limited about of time to check into the different watch faces and have found a few that I personally like. I am hoping you can create your own as I am pretty picky about the info I would like on the watch face.Some of the things AmazFit got right that even a $700 Garmin appeared to be missing:- FIND MY PHONE; the ability to ping your phone when you have misplaced it. Can\'t tell you how many times I have used this on my Apple Watch.- a quick and easy access to timers; could not figure out how to do this on the Garmin. On the T-Rex 2 it is a simple swipe down and touch the timer icon- SOFTWARE UPDATE (v9.48.1.1) arrived this morning and has some great enhancements. Control center icons are larger, apps menu icons appear larger and cleaner, weather widget has HUGE improvement, and much more.So for my first day with the product, and paying over 70% LESS, the AmazFit T-Rex 2 is an EXCEPTIONAL buy. I\'ll try to come back after a week or so and product a more detailed review one I have used it more.[NEW UPDATE, 8 days later]So it\'s been a whole week and  I will start with... I WISH I HAD DITCHED MY APPLE WATCH SOONER! I have had the T-Rex 2 on for almost 9 full days and my battery is still at 52%. #AMAZEBALLS!!! I have also begun to learn more about the workout tracking. I added a couple more photos of just part of the workout reports. I selected a Strength Training workout and did both bench press and bicep curls. The T-Rex automatically recognized which exercise I did. I touch one button to stop a set, then in counts the recovery time and then I touch the arrow on the screen to start the next set. When done, I can add the weight or I can modify this later in the app. I don\'t think Apple is here yet (if they are I never knew that).I am still very much AMAZED with my AmazFit T-Rex 2. Bravo AmazFit.', 'I used a Fitbit for the past few years but when it broke, I knew it was time for a new look. I had recently purchased an Amazfit Band 7 for my daughter and I really liked how user friendly it was, color display and how fast it charged so I thought I\'d find myself a similar one but for someone like me that hikes and does trail running. After extensive research on not only Amazfit but Garmin, Samsung and other ""budget"" brands on Amazon, I finally went with the T-Rex Pro.  The price was just right, not too expensive to justify on a smart watch and not so cheap that you start to question why it\'s so cheap.  Once I received it, I was instantly in love.  The size is 47mm, which is a little bigger than I wanted but the T-Rex 2 is 42mm and thats just too small for me.  It\'s incredibly lightweight, almos to the point you cant feel it but with the 47mm diameter you know its there.  The display is bold and crisp and the dial interface is very responsive which was a big factor for me.  The wrist wake up feature is much faster than Fitbit (which drove me crazy with Fitbit). I love the giant library of workouts, including Trail Running, which I didn\'t notice on many other models.  One of the biggest features this has that most in this price range dont have is the GPS function which I really need in the wild.  The app is basic and easy to use and I havent noticed any limiting issues with it so far.  The charging is incredible! The first day I used my T-Rex Pro I charged it overnight to 100%, I was on it all day the next day, changing faces, changing settings, just doing the most to make it exactly how I wanted it.  Hours and hours on it and it only went down to 86%.  Here\'s the kicker, I put it to charge and it was back to 100% in five minutes!!! Seriously a great product and I cant wait to do more with it!', ""SECOND UPDATE:Increased stars from 2 to 4.  Heart rate works acceptably well IF the watch is very snug against your wrist.  I was wearing it a little loose (not floppy but not snuggly either) when I was getting low HR readings.  However, by tightening the strap to a snug fit it now appears to be measuring consistent with my other two pulse oximeters.  I'm happy with the watch again.UPDATED REVIEW:PASS:• Battery Life – I get six days on a charge.  I know this is a long way from their claimed battery life but a) I have everything running (always-on display, heart rate) and b) even at 6 days this is WAY better than most of the competition.• GPS – I walk several different 4 and 5 mile road courses.  The GPS tracking is accurate enough for my purposes.  This only issue could be that the watch only shows a line for your track/location. You need the Zepp app on your phone for a map overlay.  I’ve never used it (the GPS) in an area out of cell phone coverage but would not want to risk getting lost in the deep woods depending on it.• Step Counter – I haven’t actually counted my steps for verification but over my four and five mile walks the counts are reasonably consistent and what I expect.• Watch Faces – Several hundred watch faces from simple to bizarre.  Many are free and the prices range from $0.99 to $2.99 so no big deal.FAILS:• Heart Rate Monitor – Like I said I walk and need to keep track of my heart rate and my O2.  In addition to the watch I also wear a recording pulse oximeter (supposedly FDA certified for clinical use) and take a $35 finger clip-on oximeter.  Whereas the other two pulse oximeters are in reasonable agreement, many times (very often) the watch heart rate monitor is 20 to 40 BPM low over the course of my entire walk. This is more than just a momentary reading that is off due to timing.• Blood Oxygen Sensor – Compared to my two other pulse oximeters which indicate pretty much the same readings, the watch sensor is usually three to four percentage points higher.  Also, you MUST remain perfectly still when taking an O2 reading.  Not at all useful when exercising.• Barometer – I have had three of these watches (two were exchanged) and all three gave a pressure of 45 hPa lower than the actual.  Where I live (Phoenix, AZ) the normal pressure is around 1010 hPa.  However, the watch shows 45 hPa lower, or a normal of 965 hPa.  You should note that a pressure of 960 hPa is indicative of being in the eye of a category 4 or 5 hurricane!  Research has not shown me there is a way to calibrate the watch.• Altimeter – The altimeter is based on the barometric pressure.  The altimeter can be calibrated to the correct elevation.  However, because it works off pressure and the pressure does fluctuate over the day, my house apparently jumps 30 to 40 feet during the day.• PAI – a) The algorithm for PAI is mostly based on your heart rate.  If the watch is not correctly reading your heart rate (see above comment) then your PAI will be way off.  2) According to many web resources your weekly PAI is the sum of your most recent seven daily PAI scores. However, the weekly PAI score indicated by the watch is always significantly higher than the sum of the immediately preceding seven day’s PAI.  The are several other Amazon reviews that point this out with pictures.• Weather – There is no choice in the weather service utilized.  The service ZEPP uses has limited reporting sites so it is likely your town will not be covered and you will need to reference the nearest city available.  Also, there appears to be a significant delay in reporting changes in weather.  This is probably more a function of the weather service than the watch but it still provides you with old data.• Calendar – The main issue with the calendar is that “all-day” events entered into my calendar via my phone are always indicated on the watch a day early.  A programming glitch for sure that needs to be addressed.• Compass – I don’t use the compass but every time I have “played” with it I have to first go through an aggravating calibration routine.  Not something I would trust in the woods.Who Knows:• Sleep monitor – Sleep monitors on any watch are extremely subjective and questionable.• Calories burned – Again, subjective based on an algorithm.CONCLUSION:  An expensive piece of hardware to tell you the time (which it gets from your phone) and to count your steps.  Not worth it in my opinion.ORIGINAL REVIEWL Great battery life (7 days) even with features (heart rate, O2, always-on feature) activated.  However, barometer is WAY off  and that and the related altimeter are a waste of time.  GPS tracking is fine for tracking my 4-mile residential area walks. Love the PAI workout feature but although the daily PAI makes sense, the math for rolling 7-day total is off.  There are new watch faces available daily.  I'll keep it."", 'Muy bueno, tiene muchas aplicaciones de utilidad y tiene buena duración de batería, Tiene muchas esferas las que se le pueden cambiar, lo recomiendo.', 'Excelente produto. Acabamento muito bom, fácil entendimento das funções.A única ressalva que eu faço é sobre o consumo de bateria em exercícios ao ar livre aonde o relógio conecta o GPS.A bateria que em uso normal ultrapassa 20 dias sem carregar, ao usa-lo para exercícios que necessitem do GPS e consumo aumenta bastante passando para autonomia para 5 dias, dependendo da quantidade de atividades que você faça ao ar livre', 'Excelente producto, tengo una semana usándolo y es mucho más de lo que imaginaba.

In my opinion, the battery life of a smart watch is the most important feature.  Amazfit did a great job with this watch.  Of the five smart/fitness watches I\'ve owned over the past few years, all had miserable battery life.  What good is a watch, if it has to stay on the charger?  Last year, I picked up the new Google watch as a promotion when I upgrade my phone.  In other words, I didn\'t have time to do the typical research.  :(  The first day of using it, by the time I went to bed it was dead.  I went looking for something better.Then I discovered Amazfit.  This is a watch company to be reckoned with.  I started pouring over their offerings and their lineup of models is impressive.  Initially, I purchased the Bip 3 Pro.  I bought primarily for the great price.  However, I decided to see what a modest upgrade would offer. (Nothing was wrong with the Bip 3 Pro.  It functioned fine.)  At the end of the day I decide to upgrade to the Amazfit GTS 3.  I\'m still learning the navigation and features it offers.  Below are features I found most notable, so far.Pros:1 - Battery life of 12 days.  Impressive by historical smart watch standards.2 - A little bigger display then the Pip 3 Pro.3 - The 1.75"" AMOLED screen is gorgeous.  It is super clear, bright and characters sharp.  Great contrast as well.4 - Reasonably good fitness features.  I wanted a watch that would also help me keep track of my sleep.  I haven\'t used it long enough to properly rank this now.5 - Nice soft silicone band.6 - Perfect size and looks good on my small wrist.Cons:1 - My one complaint is the small, plastic magnetic charger base.  Any bump of the watch will unseat it.  There\'s simply not enough surface area of the uber-small pins of the charger base to attach firmly with the watch.  I know some things need to be made a little cheaper to meet costs, but this could be improved.  I hope Amazfit will design and offer another charger with better magnetics.So far, I\'m very happy with this watch.  The features/price value is exceptional.  At $120 you can\'t go wrong.  Amazfit seems to be on a great track to continue to design exceptional smart watches that include all the usual features of a smart/fitness tracker. If I uncover any other features that stand out I\'ll update this review.', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Sempre usei Garmin mas agora por indicação resolvi adquirir este e além do valor se mais acessível adorei o GPS que captura muito mais rápido que o que utilizava.

In fact my dad saw me so happy with it that he just ordered the same but black version.', '3 months or so, ago, I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Flip 3 5G.  Received a $150.00 Samsung Credit.  Since I already have a pair of Galaxy Buds Pro.  I sat on that credit.  I am a mechanical watch guy.  I own at least a dozen or so mechanical watches.  Smart watches are really not my thing.  I used to wear a Rolex GMT 2 18k for travel. Getting old and wearing a gold watch is too much a target, I bought a Breitling Galactic Unitime.  However, that watch is running fast and I need to take that in for service.  I paid $800.00 to service a Rolex DD at Rolex Service Center.  While the Breitling should charge less, it would still be more than the cost of a smart watch.Due to COVID, I am not travelling, so I let the Breitling in the watch winder.  My daily watch was a Rolex DD in white metal.  There are quite a number of news about punks robbing folks with nice watches.  I do not want to be a potential target.  So, I spent my Samsung credit on a Galaxy Watch 4 44mm.  I ordered a white one with bigger screen despite I have a smaller wrist as my old eyes need all the help I can get.  I ordered it with a regular black band and I am surprised that I would like it so much. Having a Flip phone is cool but able to answer a call with a wrist watch is cooler.  I can choose to be Captain Kirk or Dick Tracy.I like the functionality of this watch so much, I purchased the Classic 4 on Black Friday week with a charger.  Both watches function about the same but I do like the Classic 4 better.  Classic 4 added a rotating bezel which is quite handy.  Putting both watches side by side, they look the same size despite one is listed 44mm and the other 46mm.  The Classic looks like a watch while the regular one looks futuristic. Both watches wear big and the bands while comfortable do not fit the watch that well.  They do not bend at the attaching prongs and created gaps on the wrist.I do wish Google Assistant is on this watch instead of Bixby.  I could side load the Google Assistant but I choose to wait for Samsung to install this at a later update.  Google Pay works, I like the fact I do not have to pull out my wallet or even my phone to pay.  I use World Time, Weather and Calendar on the watch.  I do not need to pull out the phone most of the time.Some reviewers are saying that the watch does not hold charge that well.  Both of mine would last at least 2 days.  I do not set the display to always on.  Rotate my wrist would turn the display on for about 5 seconds which is long enough to read the time.  I wore my watch sleeping just to check my sleep for fun.  I would wake up in the morning and place the watch on its charger.  By the time I made breakfast and finished it, the watch would be fully charged.I am a couch potato.  My exercise is walking the dog while I dog sit for my son.  So, the health functions are more secondary to me but I can see that would be beneficial for others.I do recommend this Galaxy 4 Classic.  In fact, either the Galaxy 4 or the Classic 4 would be good.  Personally, I like the Classic better but I am not sure it is worth the extra money.One thing that I do need to point out is: - Ordering from Amazon does not allow selection of the bands. Black watch comes with black band and white watch comes with white band. However, the band I received is sort of light gray color.  Just be aware that the watch bands that come with the watches are large sizes.  I have a 6.5 inches wrist.  While I can use the large band by using the first hole, it looks ridiculous.  I swapped the bands on the watches.  Now, the Classic 4 has the regular black band and the other one has the large grayish band.  I do not need two of the very similar watches so I am going to pass it on to one of my family members.  Just be aware while the price in Amazon might be better, you do not have a selection for bands in color or size.BTW.  Not all carriers support eSIM on a smart watch.  Google Fi does not so I did not get one with LTE.  Glad that I noticed this before I purchased the watches as that would be a waste of money.  If you want a LTE version, I suggest you check your carrier first.', ""I bought this right before the watch 6 line was announced, but I think I'd still buy this over the new Watch 6 classic. I love the physical rotating bezel, its super satisfying and actually really useful. The Watch 6 line has some nice improvements like better sensors, bigger battery, and stronger glass, but honestly the sensors on this are plenty accurate for regular use unless you're like a professional athlete or doctor, the battery is fine for me, I charge it once every day or two just whenever I feel like taking it off, and with the bezel I think the screen is pretty safe, the bezel kind of protects it. Besides, how often do you drop a watch? It's literally strapped to your arm.The stock band is nice, but I think I'll replace it soon with something a little more comfortable for working out, the silicone gets a little slimy feeling once you start sweating a lot.The sleep tracking is good, but I think the newer ones have software that offer more sleep coaching type features, it'd be nice if they made that available on older models since it seems like its just a software thing, but its not that important.Overall, great value for a watch. I'm glad they brought the rotating bezel back for the 6 Classic, but the 6 is too expensive for me, maybe I'll upgrade when the price goes down someday, but the Classic 4 is plenty for me."", ""I updated my watch from the gear S3 classic. I absolutely loved that watch I cried when it died.I have been using this watch for a few months and so far I loved it.I'm enjoying exploring and learning about the different features that this watch has, some things I wish that they would have added but nothing to disappoint.The app and the watch integrates very well there's no like to speak of.It's very comfortable it fits well.  I just wish that they had this in a black Band as an option."", ""This review of the Samsung Galaxy watch classic style, version 4, is about my take on the smartwatch itself. I'm not sure that I'm a fan of the smartwatch over an analog dumb watch but, I'm giving it a shot. I like that you get notifications from your phone and things like messages, e-mail messages, phone calls, etc. Because i tend to leave my phone somewhere in the house as i move around on a daily basis. When I'm working, they kind of go hand in hand so I would probably find the phone call or message at about the same time anyway. The watch does have a very nice appearance and I especially like the fact that the face and this version is large. That's what I was looking for when I opted for the older version four rather than the newer version 5.The buttons are easy to get to and the bezel is easy to use for navigation. There are many options that I will need to work with in order to develop the habit of wanting to use this device rather than the phone but, so far it's not proved to be a hassle. The voice reception to both speak and listen, and they watch while making a phone call, seems to be OK at best it doesn't seem great, but it does get the job done. I've had a few complaints from those on the other end of the line stating that my message became garbled or indiscernible, but in the end it did seem to work out OK."", ""The battery is WAY longer than my last watchOnly real complaint I have is that the ECG sensor requires some proprietary Samsung software, it can be cracked absurdly easily, but isn't available to anyone without a Samsung phone handy"", ""Had a 42mm and moved up to the larger 46mm and couldn't be happier. GREAT LOOKS with lots of compliments I am getting. Thanks :)"", 'Excelente producto, sin fallas y funciona muy bien 👍🏻Buena decisión para comprar un reloj inteligente']"

For swimming, Galaxy watch always record my breast stroke as back stroke and I can hardly feel any target notification when swimming. Target notification is also not helpful. For example, I set target alert for 10 length, on Garmin, the vibration alert will go off when I begin length 10. On Galaxy, the target alert goes off when I begin length 11. On Garmin, the length is to be continous for the alert to work, meaning if you swim 8 length and press pause, on resume and swimming another 2 length, alert will not be activated, you will need to swim another 10 length continously for the alert to work.

Die Uhr tut, was sie soll, und ist für meine Bedürfnisse auch genau genug. Außerdem sieht sie schick und wertig aus und es stört beim Schlafen auch kein grünes Licht wie bei meiner alten Alta HR.Bin auch glücklich, dass ich sie mit Strava nutzen kann, wobei ich da noch mehr ausprobieren muss.Außerdem habe ich für mich nützliche Apps auf der Uhr installiert (z. B. Meditations- und Pomodoro-Timer), die einwandfrei funktionieren.Kleine Mankos:- Man kann die Aktivitätenliste auf der Uhr leider nicht anpassen und spezielle Sportarten hinzufügen oder entfernen.- Die Controls sind für mich ein bisschen gewöhnungsbedürftig. Mit etwas Übung erkennt der Touchscreen jetzt fast immer mein Wischen, mein Handgelenk-Anheben zum Einschalten des Displays funktioniert auch meistens; dieser ""Knopf"" (bzw. Sensor) an der Seite zum Einschalten des Displays, Erreichen der Shortcuts und Zurückkehren zum Startbildschirm nervt mich da schon mehr (aber es geht immer besser).- Wie ihr auf dem Foto sehen könnt, kann man die Uhrzeit für Sonnenauf- und -untergang nicht lesen, weil das Wort im Deutschen zu lang ist. Bei so einer teuren Uhr sollte man schon erwarten können, dass sich mal jemand alle Funktionen im Display anschaut, um genau so etwas zu vermeiden.- Hatte Startprobleme beim Einrichten, v.a. mit Sense Connect, um per Bluetooth die Musik auf meinem Handy zu steuern. Bekam oft angezeigt, dass kein Handy verbunden sei, obwohl ich die Musik starten, pausieren oder zum nächsten Titel springen konnte, nur die Lautstärke lies sich dann nicht steuern. Oft ging auch gar nichts, oder die Verbindung brach ab. Nach Herunterfahren der Uhr und mehrfacher erneuter Kopplung funktioniert es jetzt. (Toi toi toi! War für mich ein Kaufgrund.)HINWEIS: Die neue Sense 2 hat diese Funktion nicht mehr! Mein Grund, unbedingt das ältere Modell zu kaufen.- Das Armband ist schon ein bisschen unangenehm und muss nach dem Sport und auch, wenn man noch so vorsichtig mit der Sonnencreme war (und die Uhr natürlich beim Auftragen und Einziehen nicht anhatte), gereinigt werden, damit es nicht juckt. Werde mir wahrscheinlich ein anderes kaufen.- Jeder Tracker hat seine Ungenauigkeiten. So werden hier z. B. Händewaschen und einige Bewegungen im Schlaf als Schritte gezählt. Schätze, dass dies allerdings nicht mehr 250 ""Schritte"" am Tag ausmacht. Beim Tanzen werden weniger Schritte gezählt.Fazit: Bin insgesamt zufrieden, habe sie allerdings um 50 % reduziert gekauft. Den vollen Preis wäre sie mir auf keinen Fall wert.', '✅AGGIORNAMENTO 20 NOVEMBRE 2020✅Incredibile come un semplice aggiornamento possa rivoluzionare un prodotto con delle funzionalità finalmente Smart! Scrivo queste righe aggiuntive per segnalarvi che con l’aggiornamento firmware odierno il Fitibit Sense riceve nuova vita grazie alle seguenti novità:👉🏻 ORA È POSSIBILE RISPONDERE ALLE CHIAMATE E PARLARE DIRETTAMENTE DAL FITBIT!Proprio come su Apple Watch ora il Sense può essere utilizzato come altoparlante Bluetooth per rispondere e parlare! Fighissimo! Dopo l’aggiornamento, basta entrare nell’app fitibit, andare nelle impostazioni del Sense, nella sezione chiamate vocali ed abilitarle seguendo le istruzioni indicate! Funziona anche su iPhone!👉🏻 FINALMENTE ARRIVA GOOGLE ASSISTANT ANCHE SU FITBIT👉🏻 IL SATURIMETRO RILEVA SEMPRE INDIPENDENTEMENTE DAL QUADRANTE SCELTO, MA PER VEDERE IL VALORE SARÀ SEMPRE NECESSARIO UTILIZZARE IL QUADRANTE APPOSITO👉🏻 SEGNALO MIGLIORAMENTI NELLE PRESTAZIONI E IN GENERALE IL SISTEMA MI SEMBRA PIÙ FLUIDO E REATTIVO—Premessa: il mio primo Fitbit!Ebbene si, questo è il primo dispositivo Fitbit che ho avuto modo di provare. In passato ho acquistato altri smartwatch, ma sempre sotto i 100€ e di dubbia qualità (per lo più cineserie salvo lo Xiaomi Mi Band).Per cui, la mia recensione è stata fatta a mente completamente pulita da possibili contaminazioni e paragoni con altri dispositivi simili!Inoltre preciso che ho testato il Fitbit senza abilitare l’abbonamento Premium, pertanto se non parlerò di alcune funzioni è perché semplicemente senza abbonamento non sono fruibili.👉🏻Unboxing e Prime Impressioni Anzitutto il packaging ricorda quello degli orologi di “marca”: la scatola si apre a “fisarmonica” e al centro si trova l’orologio in bella vista, al lato destro una ulteriore metà del cinturino (quella inferiore) più lunga ed utile per chi ha i polsi particolarmente larghi, mentre nella sezione di sinistra è presente il carica batterie, composto da una piccola base magnetica e dall’altra estremità da una uscita USB-A. E’ presente ovviamente tutta la manualistica necessaria al set up.Esteticamente l’orologio mi è piaciuto, le linee sono morbide e i bordi tondeggianti. Il display AMOLED da 1,58 pollici è incastonato in un case di alluminio che misura 40,5 mm. Le dimensioni sono perfette per chi come me ha i polsi sottili.Il display ha dei colori stupendi, nonché una buonissima risoluzione e rende tutte le immagini nitide e chiare! Il cinturino si smonta molto facilmente e su Amazon ci sono tantissimi cinturini alternativi. Quello che si trova in confezione è un classico cinturino in silicone di buona fattura. Tornando al display, a differenza della maggior parte dei dispositivi di fascia bassa che ho provato, questo è dotato di touchscreen, il che rende tutto molto più gestibile ed user friendly.È inoltre presente un tasto soft touch sul lato sinistro del case che funge da pulsante “home”. Purtroppo questo tasto è stato inserito in una sorta di inserzione concava, probabilmente per evitare che potesse essere facilmente ed accidentalmente premuto. Tuttavia questa scelta, se da un lato è comprensibile, dall’altro comporta una certa scomodità nel premerlo, perché bisogna letteralmente “affondare il dito dentro”. Il tasto restituisce un feedback vibrativo quando premuto.Ancora sul display, è possibile attivare la funzione di “wake up” automatico ogni qualvolta si solleva il polso (nel mio caso ha sempre funzionato) oppure è possibile attivare l’always on display, funzionalità questa resa possibile grazie alla presenza del display Amoled che spegne i pixel nel caso di immagini nere. Questa funzionalità ho preferito tenerla disattivata perché incide negativamente sulla durata della batteria.Per quanto riguarda la reattività, devo essere sincero, non ho visto grossi problemi come letto in altre recensioni. Sicuramente, quando apriamo i menù carichi di informazioni (tipo swipe verso l’alto) si verificano dei micro-lag, cioè piccolissimi rallentamenti che, nell’uso quotidiano però hanno impatto zero. Per quanto riguarda il primo avvio, la prima cosa da fare è scaricare l’app Fitbit sul proprio smartphone (nel mio caso iPhone) e creare un account. Una volta completata questa operazione e attivato il Bluetooth, sarà necessario collegare il Sense al caricatore. Una volta fatto apriamo l’app Fitbit e procediamo con il collegamento, che sarà completamente guidato a schermo. È importante mantenere il Sense collegato alla corrente per tutto il tempo necessario, altrimenti non verrà rilevato dall’iPhone.Il Sense ha un sistema operativo proprietario, sui cui è possibile installare applicazioni e personalizzazioni (ad. Esempio le whatch faces), il tutto gestito tramite l’applicazione installata sullo smartphone. Quindi, entrando nella sezione apposita, sarà possibile accedere ad una sorta di marketplace dal quale potrete scaricare diverse applicazioni, come ad esempio quelle proprietarie di Fitbit (tipo l’app per fare l’ECG) oppure app sviluppate da terze parti, tutte gratuite. Per quanto riguarda le whatch faces (ovvero i quadranti), queste possono essere intercambiate tramite l’applicazione su Smartphone. Purtroppo, al netto dei 6 di default, gli altri da scaricare sono brutti e qualitativamente scadenti. Molti, soprattutto quelli di terze parti, non funzionano e richiedono delle registrazioni su siti terzi.Il Sense riceve le notifiche dall’iPhone, ma non tutte. Ad esempio delle app social compatibili ho individuato soltanto whatsapp e instagram. Non sono riuscito ad attivare le notifiche delle mail (gmail) o di facebook.Funziona bene ed ho apprezzato tantissimo la funzione Fitbit Pay: funziona allo stesso modo di wallet su iphone, tramite l’app su smartphone possiamo configurare il wallet ed aggiungere una carta di credito o di debito compatibile. Tutto il circuito NEXI è compatibile con Fitbit Pay. Qui se siete ad esempio clienti Credit Agricole Italia potrete usufruire della funzionalità. Pagare con l’orologio oltre essere comodo è anche molto figo!Infine, sul Sense è presente Alexa. Tuttavia almeno su iPhone l’esperienza è frustrante, perché va sempre in errore e richiede costanti sincronizzazioni con lo smartpone, da fare manualmente, entrando nell’applicazione Fitbit. Pertanto nel mio caso risulta inutile e poco utilizzata. 👉🏻Funzionalità specifiche✅ Salute: Battito cardiaco in tempo reale, ECG, EDA e Monitoraggio del SonnoIl Fitbit Sense è uno smartwatch ricco di sensori e funzionalità per la salute!Funzione interessante è l’ECG. Ho impiegato circa 2 giorni per capire come eseguirla in modo corretto! Alla fine ci sono riuscito: bisogna poggiare il braccio su cui si tiene l’orologio su un tavolo e stringere forte pollice e indice dell’altra mano contro le estremità metalliche del case. Dopo 30 secondi, il Sense restituisce un feedback che se tutto va bene si concretizza nella frase “ritmo cardiaco normale”. Nulla di più! Per avere maggiori dettagli è necessario aprire l’app su smartphone ed entrare nell’apposita sezione, per dire la verità nemmeno facile da trovare! Da qui è possibile scaricare il pdf con tutti i dettagli della misurazione: purtroppo però su iPhone non sono riuscito a scaricare il pdf. Compare un messaggio “Esportazione PDF. Quando è pronto, riceverai una notifica”. Sto ancora aspettando questa notifica!Altra funzione è quella di monitor dello stress, effettuata tramite il monitoraggio della frequenza cardiaca giornaliera (che si concretizza in un punteggio di stress giornaliero) e tramite il sensore di avvità elettrodermica (EDA). Pare sia uno dei pochi, se non l’unico, smartwatch ad avere questo sensore.Devo essere sincero, questa funzionalità l’ho semplicemente testata, ma nella vita di tutti giorni – a mio parere - è alquanto inutile.Sul monitoraggio del sonno penso che questo Fitbit sia incredibile! Fornisce dati di dettaglio sulla qualità del sonno, con grafici avanzati ma di facile lettura, la media del battito, la temperatura corporea e la saturazione dell’ossigeno. Tutte queste rilevazioni sfociano in un valore, una sorta di voto al sonno, che va da 0 a 100.Cosa manca? I sensori ci sono, anche più di quanto mi sarei potuto immaginare, ma i dati raccolti sono legati a funzionalità complesse e non sono fruibili immediatamente. Non c’è modo di conoscere la saturazione dell’ossigeno, ma soltanto la media notturna, stessa cosa per la temperatura corporea. E’ come avere una Ferrari ma guidarla soltanto in città con limite di velocità a 30 km/h. Spero in un futuro aggiornamento che renda questi sensori liberamente utilizzabili, per avere delle rilevazioni real time, come accade con la rilevazione del battito cardiaco.✅ Fitness e sport: Contapassi e piani saliti, numerosi profili e attività sportive pre caricateFunzionalità presente in tutti gli smartwatch e smartband, anche di bassissima categoria, è il conta passi, chiaramente presente in questo Fitbit. Oltre a contare i passi, è anche in grado di contare quante volte saliamo le scale, il tutto in modo preciso. In realtà sul conta passi ho scoperto che tende a contare i passi anche quando facciamo dei semplici salti o sobbalzi: probabilmente è un filino troppo sensibile e ciò è molto pericoloso perché nel concreto tende leggermente a sovrastimare.Il Sense è dotato di GPS interno. Quindi se andiamo a fare una corsa senza smartphone, riusciremo comunque a raccogliere dati molto precisi su velocità media e kilometri percorsi.👉🏻Durata della batteriaPer quanto riguarda la mia esperienza, dopo il primo ciclo di ricarica, senza attivare l’always on, il fitbit ha resistito 6 giorni. La mattina del sesto ho dovuto procedere alla ricarica.La ricarica è sorprendentemente veloce, in meno di 1 ora si ricarica completamente.👉🏻In sintesiIl Sense è uno smartwatch che ti lascia per certi versi l’amaro in bocca. E’ bello, ben costruito e con tante funzionalità, ma molto spessi ci si perde in un bicchier d’acqua. Su iPhone è poco autonomo, richiede frequenti sincronizzazioni manuali con lo smartphone, ad esempio anche soltanto per vedere il meteo. Inoltre la presenza di alcuni sensori e l’impossibilità di sfruttarli real time è spesso aberrante (mi riferisco ad esempio al saturimetro).Non sono certamente i microlag il problema, ma semmai la consapevolezza di avere tra le mani probabilmente il miglior smartwatch sul mercato, completamente castrato e impossibilitato a dare il 100%. Oggi come oggi, a chi ha un iPhone, consiglio di investire in un Apple Watch.', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0RECENSIONE SMARTWATCH FITBIT SENSE ACCOPPIATO AD APPLE IPHONE XGli argomenti da trattare su un dispositivo di questa tipologia sono tantissimi, cercherò di essere il più breve e conciso possibile riassumendo e portando in risalto l\'esperienza d\'uso ed il mio sincero e personalissimo parere. Eviterò al massimo di dare dati tecnici noiosi che possiamo leggere con semplicità in scheda prodotto o trovare in giro dappertutto sul web.Prima di utilizzare questo SENSE, ho posseduto e possiedo Apple watch 4 e Garmin Fenix 5, vi dico questo per farvi avere un idea di quella che è la mia esperienza con questi dispositivi e di conseguenza il livello di aspettativa che avevo nei confronti di SENSE.ATTENZIONE : Il giorno 25.11.2020 ho ricevuto e installato l\'aggiornamento di SENSE che ha apportato alcune nuove funzionalità al dispositivo. Tra le più interessanti ho trovato la possibilità di poter rispondere alle telefonante direttamente dal Watch e l\'implementazione della possibilità di ascoltare le risposte dell\'assistente vocale Alexa. Adesso è anche presente l\'icona dell\'assistente vocale di Google ma al momento non è ancora attivabile. Purtroppo si dovrà attendere l\'inizio del 2021 per poterlo abilitare e dovrebbe essere disponibile solo in lingua inglese.E\'POSSIBILE AVVIARE UNA CONVERSAZIONE TELEFONICA su SENSE solo ed esclusivamentesu chiamate in arrivo, non si può in alcun modo avviare telefonate dal SENSE. La qualità audio e il volume in conversazione non rasentano l\'eccellenza ma si comportano in modo soddisfacente. Quello che delude parecchio è il volume dell\'assistente vocale decisamente basso e la scarsa qualità della sua voce. Vi garantisco che se vi trovate in ambienti silenziosi riuscirete ad ascoltare e capire ciò che dice, in ambienti anche solo leggermente rumorosi farete davvero tanta fatica a comprendere. Un\'altra cosa che non ho apprezzato e che non è implementata la possibilità di inserire suoni alle notifiche, dovremo ancora affidarci alla vibrazione troppo delicata e il più delle volte difficile da percepire.I PROBLEMI SOFTWARE sembrano essere migliorati ( riavvii spontanei e blocchi saltuari ) resta un eccessiva lentezza nella navigazione nei menù con qualche lag di troppo.AL MOMENTO, NONOSTANTE l\'ultimo aggiornamento, SENSE lo ritengo ancora eccessivamente costoso in rapporto a quanto è in grado di offrire. Attendevo questo aggiornamento per la valutazione finale che purtroppo, ancora non riesce a spingerlo oltre le 3 stelle.- DA QUESTO MOMENTO IN POI LEGGERETE LA RECENSIONE SCRITTA PRIMA DELL\'AGGIORNAMENTO  DEL GIORNO 25.11.2020APPENA ESTRATTO dalla sua gradevole confezione, mi sono accorto che la batteria era totalmente scarica, cosa assolutamente non buona per per preservarla da problemi durante la fase di stoccaggio. Non so se questo inconveniente l\'ho riscontrato solo io, magari per qualche ragione il watch è stato dimenticato acceso prima dello stoccaggio.ALL\'INTERNO DELLA CONFEZIONE troveremo oltre al watch, il cavetto per la ricarica che si aggancia magneticamente al SENSE e carica il dispositivo attraverso 4 pin fisici. E\' presente poi anche un ulteriore cinturino di misura più grande. Ovviamente la prima cosa che ho fatto è stata quella di metterlo sotto carica, grazie al supporto alla ricarica veloce, nel giro di circa 50 minuti il SENSE era già al 100%.PROSEGUENDO ho immediatamente apprezzato il gradevole design, la forma è abbastanza simile ad Apple watch, davvero bello il disegno di questo SENSE oltre che ad essere leggero e comodissimo da tenere al polso, realizzato in policarbonato e acciaio.L\'UNICO TASTO PRESENTE è di tipo aptico, si trova sul lato sinistro del SENSE ed è una delle cose che non mi è piaciuta assolutamente. Lo trovo scomodissimo, difficile sia da raggiungere che da premere. Avrei preferito la presenza di un tasto fisico, magari posizionato sul lato destro di SENSE come per Apple watch 4.IL CINTURINO é proprietario, realizzato in silicone ed è intercambiabile, lo sgancio del cinturino nel caso lo volessimo sostituire è affidato ad un sistema rapido che funziona benissimo tramite la pressione di un tastino posto sotto la scocca del watch. Ad essere sincero, questo cinturino lo trovo un pò fastidioso da inserire ma una volta agganciato non crea alcun tipo di problema.IL DISPLAY è un Amoled da 1,58"" di ottima qualità, neri profondissimi, colori accesi e buona luminosità. Si vede benissimo sotto ogni condizione di luce. E\' possibile anche attraverso la funzione Always-on decidere di tenerlo sempre acceso, cosa che sconsiglio a chi predilige l\'autonomia. Non manca ovviamente la possibilità di accenderlo con la rotazione del polso o tappando sul Touch.L\'IMPERMEABILITA\' permette di immergerlo fino a 50 metri di profondità, consiglio comunque di sciacquare  sempre tutti i Watch con acqua dolce nel caso in cui li dovessimo usare in mare per via della forte aggressività della salsedine.LA VIBRAZIONE la trovo eccessivamente delicata, nonostante l\'abbia impostata su modalità ""FORTE"", fatico davvero tantissimo ad accorgermi dell\'arrivo delle notifiche.LA SUONERIA al momento non è presente e dovremo affidarci solo alla vibrazione ma pare che a fine 2020 sarà disponibile, anche perchè leggendo sul sito Fitbit, SENSE dovrebbe disporre di speaker integrato.LE CONVERSAZIONI TELEFONICHE al momento non sono disponibili, anche per questo dovremo attendere fine 2020. Infatti è possibile in caso di ricezione di una chiamata, visualizzare la notifiche e scegliere se rifiutarla o aprire la conversazione sullo smartphone.I PAGAMENTI tramite SENSE, grazie alla presenza dell\'NFC sono possibili, il problema è che i circuiti bancari supportati da Fitbit Pay al momento sono pochissimi in confronto a quelli offerti dai dispositivi concorrenti.L\'ASSISTENTE VOCALE al momento disponibile è Alexa, non mi soddisfa particolarmente ma si vocifera l\'implementazione dell\'assistente Google a fine 2020, attendo fiducioso.LE NOTIFICHE su IPHONE X e quindi sistema operativo IOS sono decisamente limitate. Infatti l\'unica cosa possibile è la visualizzazione del testo. Ad esempio, se riceviamo una notifica da Telegram piuttosto che da WhatsApp, sarà possibile solo leggere il contenuto ed eventualmente cancellarla ma non si potrà rispondere in alcun modo. Cosa diversa per i possessori di smartphone Android che potranno interagire con la notifica rispondendo con dettatura vocale e messaggi preimpostati.L\'AUTONOMIA l\'ho trovata decisamente buona, tralasciando il fatto che SENSE si carica molto velocemente, offre anche una durata di 5/6 giorni se non attiviamo Always-on display.LA SENSORISTICA disponibile su SENSE è quanto di più completo si possa trovare oggi su uno smartwatch. Il sensore per il monitoraggio del battito cardiaco, L\'ECG, il sensore per misurare la temperatura corporea, L\'EDA sensor che serve per misurare i livelli di stress e non manca neanche il lettore SpO2 per misurare il livello di ossigenazione del sangue. Il problema a parer mio è che avrei preferito una gestione migliore di questi sensori. Ad esempio l\'SpO2 è possibile attivarlo solo ed esclusivamente se scarichiamo dall\'App un unica Watch face e funziona solo di notte mentre dormiamo. Non è possibile attivare manualmente la lettura a nostro piacere. Stessa cosa vale per la misurazione della temperatura corporea, praticamente il SENSE misura solo di notte mentre dormiamo la differenza di temperatura in più o in meno rispetto alla nostra basale. Non è possibile leggere la temperatura corporea a nostro comando. Anche il sensore EDA lo trovo abbastanza inutile implementato in questo modo a livello software, sarebbe stato interessante avere delle notifiche da parte del SENSE nel caso di rilevazioni di livelli di stress aumentato. Il monitoraggio del sonno ho notato che funziona veramente molto bene, risulta molto più veritiero e preciso rispetto ad altri dispositivi da me testati. Ovviamente non mancano sensori ormai di serie su dispositivi top di gamma come il GPS, il Bluetooth, il Wifi, L\'NFC e compagnia bella.L\'APPLICAZIONE disponibile per smartphone è una miniera di informazioni. Si trova davvero di tutto. Ci sono registrazioni di dati legati alle molteplici attività sportive disponibili su SENSE oltre che a tutti i dati legati ai sensori di cui dispone. Nonostante la stia utilizzando da un pò di giorni, ho sempre la sensazione di perdermi e incasinarmi tra i vari giri di menù. Diciamo che avrei preferito un interfaccia più semplice da navigare, la trovo un pò troppo dispersiva, comunque davvero tanta roba. Inoltre, attraverso l\'applicazione è possibile personalizzare il SENSE a nostro piacimento, ci sono una marea di watch face ed eventualmente sarà anche possibile scaricare ed installare un bel pò di applicazioni sul Watch.L\'ABBONAMENTO PREMIUM è in forma gratuita per sei mesi dall\'attivazione, dopo di che avrà un costo di circa 10 euro al mese. Praticamente sblocca tutta una serie di metriche, funzioni e dati in più all\'interno dell\'app per ricavare il massimo dal dispositivo. Devo dire che questa è una cosa che non ho apprezzato particolarmente. Il dispositivo ha già un costo di ingresso decisamente elevato e non mi sembra una buona soluzione pagare ulteriori 10 euro al mese per poterlo usare al pieno delle possibilità.ADESSO PASSIAMO A RACCONTARE QUELLO CHE SU SENSE MI HA PARTICOLARMENTE DELUSO, CIOE\' QUELLO CHE SECONDO IL MIO PARERE PERSONALE DEVE ESSERE ASSOLUTAMENTE RIVISTO E SISTEMATO DA PARTE DI FITBITIL TOUCH DELLO SCHERMO è pessimo, risulta poco sensibile e non sempre reattivo, inoltre capita spesso di dover tappare 2/3 volte per farlo attivare.LA NAVIGAZIONE NEI MENU\' di SENSE è fortemente laggosa ( poco fluida )  e presenta frequenti impuntamenti. Non mi sarei mai aspettato un fluidità cosi mediocre su un dispositivo top di gamma su questa fascia di prezzo.PRESENTA DIVERSI PROBLEMI a livello software, ho assistito a riavvii spontanei del SENSE durante l\'utilizzo, inoltre mi è capitato di trovarlo acceso e in blocco su una schermata dove l\'unica soluzione per ripristinarlo è stata il riavvio.IL TASTO LATERALE è tanto scomodo e rende non piacevole la navigazione e la gestone di SENSE ma su questo credo ci sia poco da poter sistemare.LE MIE PERSONALI CONSIDERAZIONI IN CONCLUSIONEParto con lo sconsigliarvi fortemente l\'acquisto di SENSE se siete possessori di dispositivi IOS. Non riuscireste a fruttarlo pienamente soprattutto nel comportato notifiche. Se avete Iphone andate di Apple watch senza neanche pensarci.Per i possessori di Smartphone ANDROID il discorso è differente, sembrano meglio implementate le notifiche ma restano i grossolani problemi sopra elencati. Al momento sconsiglio l\'acquisto, lo ritengo un dispositivo ancora troppo in fase embrionale. L\'impressione che ho avuto è un pò quella che fitbit ha voluto mettere sul mercato SENSE troppo in fretta. Ci sono troppi Lag, troppi riavvii spontanei, tante mancanze come la possibilità di usare lo speaker per le conversazioni telefoniche, una suoneria da abbinare alla vibrazione, qualche circuito bancario in più per sfruttare Fitbit pay  ma anche qualche Watch face in più con gestione dell\' SpO2.Quello che penso è che le potenzialità su SENSE ci sono tutte per diventare un ottimo dispositivo ma i tanti sensori devono essere sfruttati meglio, il software ripulito dai bug, la fluidità decisamente aumentata, il Touch sistemato e implementati assistente Google, suoneria e conversazioni telefoniche. In definitiva non è quello che ci si aspetta da uno smartwatch che al momento costa Euro 329,00.Ho cercato di essere il meno noioso ma più esaustivo possibile. Sperando che il mio parere vi sia stato di aiuto per le vostre valutazioni, ne approfitto per ringraziarvi e salutare..', 'Die Uhr war schnell geliefert.Gut Verpackt.Super Funktionen.Viele Zifferblätter auswählbar.Braucht bei Dauer Sichtbarkeit mehr Akku hält 3 Tage .Großes Manko ist der Schmerz am Handgelenk bzw. an der ganzen Hand .Hervorgerufen durch den Taststrahl .Habe gelesen das auch andere Schwierigkeiten damit haben !Meine Frau übrigens auch !Abhilfe bringt wenn man Malerband ( Goldband ) zweimalig draufklebt.Danach hatte ich nur noch einmal diese Schmerzen hab auf 3 lagen erhöht und da funktioniert.Das liest du aber in keiner Beschreibung!Wenn die Uhr kaputt ist war das für mich die letzte .Wer sie verträgt ist das schon eine Kaufempfehlung.', '✅ Ho deciso di fare una recensione per chiarire i problemi di questo smartwatch. Di recensioni ce ne sono già tantissime.. e molto complete. Siccome ho notato che molti giudizi negativi sono dovuti a problemi software, voglio raccontare la mia esperienza indicando come ho risolto alcuni di questi problemi.🏃 Non sono un maniaco della forma fisica ma svolgo spesso attività sportive (appena ne ho il tempo) e cammino tanto. Mi interessa uno smartwatch che:- mi supporti nella gestione delle attività da svolgere- monitori le mie attività per evitare che il lavoro prenda il sopravvento sulla salute.************************💪In breve, LE MIE NECESSITA\', soddisfatte da fitbit, sono:🔋 Batteria superiore ai 2 giorni. Lo Smartwatch deve semplificare la vita e non complicarla. E\' inutile (PER ME) avere qualcosa che deve essere sempre ricaricato (vedi Apple o Samsung) o che è meglio rimuovere (per preservare la batteria) durante la notte (quando è importante monitorare lo stato di salute). Fitbit dura 4-5 giorni (e se venisse ottimizzato lato software potrebbe arrivare a 7gg).🤑 Prezzo inferiore ai 250€ (ho approfittato dell\'offerta a 150€ del Fitbit \'Sense\' dopo tutto è un modello superato dal \'Sense 2\' con piccoli aggiornamenti lato software)💸 NFC pagamenti. Non è per fare il figo... ma per comodità. Per esempio: la gente dimentica la carta di credito o il cellulare alla cassa del supermercato nella fretta di sistemare le buste e pagare. Dato che non abbiamo 3 mani, è più comodo usare lo Smartwatch. Per questo non ho scelto uno smartwatch Huawei.💬 Assistente vocale. In qualsiasi momento (non si ha il telefono sotto mano) viene in mente una cosa da fare o una scadenza, basta dettare all\'assistente vocale. Mi ha davvero semplificato la vita! Per questo motivo non ho preso uno smartwatch Xiaomi.📞 Risposta a telefonate. Ottimo per la classica telefonata che ti arriva quando non hai il cellulare in mano, per dire: ""ti richiamo fra 2 minuti"" oppure ""fra 5 minuti sono arrivato""📲 Invio di (o risposta a) messaggi. Quante volte si rischia di cadere o causare incidenti in auto per inviare messaggi? Utilissimo per messaggi del tipo: ""invia whatsapp a Mario Rossi sto arrivando"" senza distogliere lo sguardo da ciò che si sta facendo.🔍 Materiali e design: bello, comodo e leggero. Ottima la scelta delle forma quadrata che preferisco per ottimizzare i contenuti del display (la forma rotonda SECONDO ME va bene solo per gli orologi classici con le lancette... stop). Schermo ottimo: si vede bene sotto il sole. Sensori di tutto rispetto con la possibilità dell\'ECG*************************❌ Vediamo adesso i problemiPremesso che il mio Fitbit funziona bene dal punto di vista hardware, i miei problemi sono TUTTI DOVUTI AL SOFTWARE. Poche volte mi è capitato di vedere APP progettate e realizzate così male come Fitbit. Siccome voglio essere costruttivo nelle critiche, espongo i problemi e le soluzioni.👎 PROBLEMA 1️⃣PRIMA INSTALLAZIONE da incubo. Si benedicono gli orologi di Apple. Procedura progettata senza pensare alla User Experience. Prendetevi una mezza giornata libera per configurare Fitbit altrimenti rischiate di buttarlo dalla finestra. Ad un certo punto vi ritroverete con una bellissima animazione con una X rossa ad alta definizione che mostrerà sull\'orologio il messaggio di ""errore generico si prega di riprovare"" oppure ""qualcosa è andato storto"". Applausi 👏👏👏👏. Consiglio di non configurare il WiFi \U0001f6dc sull\'orologio per scaricare gli aggiornamenti del firmware (A ME SI BLOCCAVA TUTTO): meglio farli scaricare al telefono e poi passarli all\'orologio (A ME HA FUNZIONATO)👎 PROBLEMA 2️⃣App Fitbit progettata malissimo. Bastava copiare dalle altre App. Informazioni confuse buttate in maniera casuale fra le 4 sezioni.- sezioni ""Oggi"".  Il 99% delle info sono qui. Il nome è sbagliato perché si trovano anche dati e statistiche sui giorni precedenti. Ci vogliono 3-4 giorni per districarsi nel dedalo di dati presenti 😫😫😫. L\'app di Xiaomi (per le Band da 30 €) è anni-luce più avanti.. figuriamoci Huawei o Samsung.- sezione ""Scopri"". Il nome è sbagliato perché qui trovi tutto ciò che i progettisti software non sono riusciti a inserire nella sezione precedente: esercizi da svolgere, report sulla salute del cuore, galleria quadranti e statistiche su salute e benessere. Ancora complimenti ai progettisti 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼- sezione ""Comunità"". Inutile. Già è difficile tenere connesso l\'orologio con il telefono.. figuriamoci tenersi in contatto con amici e parenti per scambiarsi i dati sugli allenamenti. Consiglio ai maniaci della forma fisica e della condivisione di usare prodotti come Garmin e Polar oppure App di condivisione con Strava & Co.- sezione ""Premium"". E\' stato già detto tutto: è come chiedere ad una persona che ha comprato l\'auto di pagare un extra per usare l\'autoradio. Chissà quanti orologi Fitbit non sono stati venduti per colpa di questi inutili abbonamenti!!!🗓️ Dopo un paio di settimane si fa l\'abitudine a questo abominio di interfaccia software.👎 PROBLEMA 3️⃣Limitazioni del software per giustificare l\'acquisto della versione 2 del Sense. Per esempio: non si può usare per pagare con NFC il circuito Google Pay, ma solo Fitbit Pay (che è meno supportato dalle banche). Per fortuna esiste Revolut che risolve questo problema (oltre a quello dei pagamenti in valuta straniera). Ci vuole solo un po\' di volontà per eliminare questo problema unificando la gestione dei pagamenti di Google (la stessa volontà che ha reso disponibile su ""Sense"" l\'assistente vocale Google che prima era riservato solo al ""Sense 2"")👎👎👎👎👎 PROBLEMA 4️⃣ 🏆️🏆️🏆️🏆️🏆️La lamentela più frequente (quasi il 90% delle recensioni negative) è la disconnessione fra l\'app Fitbit (sul telefono) e l\'orologio.Il Fitbit usa 2 connessioni Bluetooth con il telefono: ""Sense"" e ""Sense Controls"". Essendoci due diversi canali di comunicazione possiamo trovarci in condizioni tali che alcune funzioni vanno bene e altre no.Inoltre l\'app Fitbit non mostra chiaramento lo stato della connessione con l\'orologio: è presente una barra di sincronizzazione in alto (in cui all\'avvio compare ""Sincronizzazione di Sense..."") che però sparisce dopo pochi secondi. Se la connessione non riesce, l\'utente non lo sa. Complimenti ai progettisti 🎖️🎖️🎖️ Suggerimento: inserite nell\'App una piccola icona sempre visibile con colori verde o rossa (dai su, è facile da fare) 🤐🤐🤐********************************💥 SOLUZIONI AI PROBLEMI (CHE HO RISCONTRATO) DI DISCONNESSIONE App-OrologioOnde evitare che si restituiscano prodotti funzionanti a causa di problemi software, scrivo qualche trucco per risolvere i bug 🪲🪲🪲 dell\'App Fitbit che finora ho riscontrato. Infatti l\'app Fitbit fornisce consigli banali (""riavvia questo o quello"") che MAI sono riusciti a risolvere i MIEI problemi. Vediamo i trucchi.💫 APP Fitbit (impostazioni - sense - notifiche) dice che l\'orologio non ha accesso alle notifiche, consigliando di riavviare lo smartphone (il riavvio non serve a nulla).🎯 Il problema è che le app in Android per accedere alle notifiche devono avere dei privilegi speciali. Nelle impostazioni di Android andare nella voce ""accesso alle notifiche"" e impostare che l\'app Fitbit possa accedere al contenuto delle notifiche. La procedura dipende dal cellulare ma basta cercare sul web ""accesso app alle notifiche MODELLOSMARTPHONE"".💫 APP Fitbit dice che la sincronizzazione è fallita. In questo caso ci sono più soluzioni:🎯 Andare nelle impostazioni di Android nella sezione App (o Gestione App), cercare l\'app Fitbit (che ovviamente non deve avere restrizioni sul risparmio energetico) e cliccare sui pulsanti ""chiusura forzata"" e ""svuota la cache"". Riavviando l\'app dovrebbe funzionare. Attenzione: se cliccate sul pulsante ""cancella tutti dati"" (come molti tutorial consigliano) dovete ripetere la configurazione dell\'app da capo, settando a mano molte impostazioni... NEL MIO CASO ho provato una volta ma NON HO RISOLTO il problema.🎯 Spegnere l\'orologio (impostazioni- spegnimento) e poi riaccenderlo premendo il pulsante laterale (mi capita alcune volte dopo la ricarica dell\'orologio).🎯 Se alcune notifiche (es: SMS o WhatsApp) arrivano sull\'orologio ma la sincronizzazione dell\'app Fitbit fallisce, significa che solo una connessione Bluetooth viene gestita correttamente dall\'app. Rimedio: usare dall\'orologio l\'assistente vocale (es: impostare un timer) e dopo la sincronizzazione riprende.💥 FINORA CON QUESTI TRUCCHI HO SEMPRE RISOLTO. INCROCIAMO LE DITA 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼L\'app Fitbit di Android (giudizio UNA STELLA) dovrebbe essere completamente riscritta da Google. Questo consentirebbe all\'universo di Big G di uniformarsi e di evitare che buoni prodotti (come gli orologi Fitbit) siano penalizzati dai software. Purtroppo come tutte le grandi aziende, ci vuole tempo a prendere decisioni così importanti. Sono fiducioso che ciò avverrà se Google non vuole rimanere indietro in questo campo dove i rivali hanno TUTTI sviluppato ottime App. Infatti:- Apple e Samsung sono indietro dal punto di vista della autonomia- Huawei e Xiaomi offrono solo alcune delle funzioni che l\'orologio fitbit offre (a parità di prezzo): risposta alle notifiche, integrazione con gli assistenti vocali e pagamenti NFC.✅ Spero che vi sia stata utile questa mia recensione ""pratica""', ""Soffro spesso di ipertensione arteriosa e per me tenere sotto costante controllo il battito cardiaco è davvero importante per evitare rischi alla mia salute, ho trovato anche molto utile la funzione che permette di registrare manualmente la temperatura corporea attraverso l'app dedicata che ho scaricato sul mio smartphone e la funzione per annotare manualmente l'acqua che bevo ogni giorno e le calorie che assumo con la mia alimentazione e tenerle sempre a portata di polso. Sempre attraverso l'applicazione dedicata mi è bastato scansionare i codici ean (i cosiddetti codici a barre) degli alimenti che consumo e aggiungerli al mio menù, anche senza conoscere i valori nutrizionali degli alimenti. In tal modo l'app mi tiene sotto controllo il livello di carboidrati, proteine, grassi e altre sostanze che introduco ogni giorno nella mia dieta, per poi restituirmi un report alimentare su app e sull'orologio, in alternativa posso inserire manualmente i cibi che consumo, o ancora fornire i dati nutrizionali. Ho anche la possibilità di integrare la borraccia fitbit per monitorare in modo automatico i litri di acqua che bevo ogni giorno, poiché per me è impossibile tenere a mente quanti bicchieri o quante bottiglie d'acqua bevo durante le mie giornate, specie quando svolgo attività fisica.Prima di uscire di casa non riesco mai a guardare il meteo, con quest'orologio ho le condizioni meteo sempre disponibili sotto il quadrante dell'orologio, mi basta fare tap dal basso verso l'alto sul display.Ho impostato la modalità di visualizzazione del display in modo automatico, questo mi permette di visualizzare l'orario semplicemente portando l'orologio vicino al petto, senza necessità di toccare lo schermo quando ad esempio ho le mani sporche o una sola mano libera, come ad esempio durante la guida, o quando lavoro al computer.All'interno dell'orologio è infatti presente un sensore che rileva il movimento rotatorio del polso; in alternativa è possibile impostare la visualizzazione del display con doppio touch o mantenendolo sempre attivo, ciò però innesta un consumo maggiore della batteria, la quale inizialmente ha un'autonomia di circa 8-10 giorni con una carica di 1 sola ora tramite presa elettrica e di circa 1 ora e 40 minuti tramite pc.Sulla schermata principale, la quale è personalizzabile, mostra il quadrante dell'orologio, il numero di passi fatti sin dall'inizio della giornata, il battito cardiaco sul momento e la qualità del sonno della notte precedente. La qualità del sonno viene calcolata paragonando diversi fattori, tra cui il tempo in cui si è rimasti a letto svegli, le ore di sonno leggero e quelle di sonno profondo, nonché l'ossigenazione del sangue. Pensavo di dover indicare al dispositivo un orario standard in cui vado a letto, ma in realtà esso calcola tutto in maniera autonoma, persino quando mi sdraio sul letto ma magari intrattenendomi con un libro o guardando un film prima di dormire. Davvero sorprendente.Come funziona per lo smartphone, anche Fitbit Sense offre una serie di interruttori tramite i quali è possibile attivare o disattivare alcune funzioni o adattare il dispositivo affinchè risponda alle mie necessità.Attraverso dei classici interruttori infatti posso aumentare o diminuire la luminosità dello schermo, impostare l'attivazione automatica o manuale del display o tenendolo sempre acceso impostare la modalità sonno e regolare il volume della musica riprodotta, il dispositivo infatti si integra perfettamente con le app spotify e dazeer, mentre è possibile scaricare altre applicazioni sull'orlogio da uno store interamente dedicato (non paragonabile al play o app store, ma comunque molto utili).L'orologio mi permette anche di effettuare una scansione EDA, ovvero una scansione riguardante il mio livello di rilassamento attraverso una sessione veloce della durata di 2 minuti, o una sessione guidata della durata di 60 minuti.Nelle altre schermate l'orologio mi offre una panoramica completa, attraverso l'altimetro integrato, su quanti piani abbia salito o disceso e la distanza percorsa durante l'arco della giornata, oltre a fornirmi anche dati circa il rapporto tra le ore passate seduto e le ore in cui mi mantengo in movimento, durante la giornata infatti stimola ad alzarsi e passeggiare un pò dopo diverse ore che si è rimasti fermi seduti.Sense rileva anche quando mi dedico all'attività fisica, oltre a capire, spesso in maniera del tutto autonoma che sport svolgo, per quanto tempo e quante calorie consumo durante le mie sessioni di allenamento.È indicato anche per molti sport acquatici essendo anche impermeabile, sconsiglio però di utilizzarlo in acque particolarmente salate per evitare di causare ossidazione delle aree metalliche o accumulo di calcare o sali negli incastri del cinturino; non possiede alcuna presa di ricarica a incastro, e per poter ricaricare il dispositivo è necessario collegare l'alimentatore magnetico nella parte posteriore al display, ove è anche presente il sensore che rileva quando il dispositivo viene indossato e che monitora anche l'attività cardiaca e il livello di ossigenazione. Questa modalità di ricarica mi permette di mantenere intatte le qualità di cavi e connettori, limitando la possibilità di provocare difetti o malfunzionamenti quando connetto o rimuovo il cavo di ricarica al dispositivo.L'orologio si connette allo smartphone tramite bluethoot, e si sincronizza in maniera automatica e manuale, mostrando contemporaneamente il diario di riepilogo della settimana anche su app.Sull'app dedicata Fitbit è consultabile in manuale delle istruzioni del prodotto in maniera digitale, le F.A.Q., un forum dove è possibile conversare con altri utenti e chiedere chiarimenti e consigli sull'utilizzo del prodotto e di altri prodotti di nicchia, contattare l'assistenza Fitbit, e accedere allo shop dedicato per poter trovare altre ispirazioni, personalizzare il proprio dispositivo o la propria esperienza di utilizzo dell'orologio.L'esperienza Fitbit correlata all'utilizzo di Sense mi ha fatto riscoprire un nuovo modo di vivere le mie giornata e mi ha offerto uno stimolo in più per reimpostare la sveglia e far ripartire il mio corpo verso un percorso di miglioramento del mio stato di salute e della mia forma fisica. Numerose altre funzioni sono ancora da scoprire, ma l'esperienza fino ad ora mi ha davvero sorpreso.Sull'orologio, inoltre sono disponibili funzioni dedicate per sveglie, timer e cronometro, agenda, wallet per i pagamenti elettronici (configurabile con Google Pay), area dedicata per la consultazione del coach personale, estensione per il controllo remoto di Alexa.Inoltre, l'orologio si connette in maniera ottima con lo smarphone tramite bluethoot, ma è anche possibile impostare diverse connessioni wi-fi impostando dall'app le relative chiavi di accesso.Tramite la connessione con lo smartphone permette di far squillare e ritrovare il telefono.Sull'orologio è possibile, in maniera diretta, accedere al quadro delle impostazioni per poter personalizzare il prodotto e adattarlo in base alle proprie esigenze.Sull'app inoltre ho a disposizione numerose altre funzioni, consigli e suggerimenti da applicare alla mia routine, nonché alle mie sessioni di allenamento grazie ad un abbonamento premium, di cui 3 mesi sono sempre gratuiti con l'acquisto dell'orologio."", 'UPDATE: 2 FULL YEARS later practically to the date. My SENSE crapped out. Was a good Smartwatch up until it just started not working (only showed fitbit icon, intermittent vibration, would work for a few hours, then go back to showing nothing. Was a quick death). Not changing rating as all these gadgets are basically throw aways. Now back to original review:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Probably want to select reviews based on ""most recent"" as that will provide you with most up to date and relevant information pertaining to this product. I acquired my Fitbit Sense in June 2021, it has not yet been a month, but so far so good with 24/7 use. I am slow to check out and use all the features, but what I have interacted with so far has been stellar.I have been using Fitbit products since April 2015- kinda have a love/hate relationship with this brand. I use the activity tracker constantly, and I greatly enjoy the app. So I have stuck with it as I upgraded over the years (Charge x2, Blaze x2, Versa 2, and now Sense). As with many Fitbit users, there is a known frustration with the products. Despite some of my own qualms, and having the ability to spend whatever I want on any fitness tracker I want, I still end up (so far) with this brand. Mostly because I haven\'t found a tracker and app that I totally like better. I even have a Garmin, but I find that so far off base of accuracy (save for HR), that it is a glorified watch. Garmin seems to do best for actual intended activities (going for a run, going for a long walk, going cycling) where it seems to not be accurate in steps for any other part of the day (only counts about 1/3 of actual steps unless engaged in a longer duration activity, and even then it takes a few minutes for it to start). Also, the app seems to have a lot of info, but doent really tell me anything. That being said, when it was time for me to buy another fitness tracker--I went from Versa 2 to Garmin.. back to Fitbit. I went with the Sense because the price was right, and it was an upgrade over the Versa 2.  After my underwhelming experience with the Garmin, I would have happily taken over a 2nd hand Charge from 2015. At least my steps would be accurate.Ok, so back to the Sense. WOW, the visual on the screen is really clear and precise. Even way more so over the Versa 2, and I had no issues with that. Set up was EASY, and QUICK.  Basically, just like in adding any other fitbit, just let it pair and it will very quickly be all set and ready to go. I didnt have any weird upselling offerings, or at least nothing that wasn\'t fantastically easy to opt out from. Nothing shady that I saw.ONE POINT that I DO think is important to know is that if you happen to have a Versa 2 (Not sure if this also happens with regular Versa, Versa Lite, or Versa 3), but this could not be added alongside my Versa 2. I had to take the Versa 2 offline in order to add this Sense. I know this is the case with trying to add more than one of the same products, yet I have always been able to have several Fitbits paired no problem, as long as they were different models. SO, I guess the Fitbit app sees Sense and Versa 2 as the same. Not a big deal as my Versa 2 had essentially died after I wore it on a hot humid day and my sweat killed it (then I brought it back to life after putting it in a bag of rice for about a week, Then afterward the battery was never the same. It drained to nothing daily.. and I needed to not have to worry about daily charging.. hence my picking up a Garmin in the interim to see if I liked them enough to spring for a more fancy model--nope-- and ended up buying the Sense.)Hope it lasts. I love the look. The band is way better than the old pin style. Swapping out bands is so much quicker, easier, less need for super fine motor skills. LOVE the charger. It just sort of magnetizes to the fitbit. No need to clip in.SP02 wasn\'t the main feature I was drawn to, but in order to have accurate use it seems a special clock face is needed, and that clock face will drain battery quicker (from what I have read). That being said,Battery life has been excellent for me.Love being able to add other apps, and features.  Scrolling is easy, turning face on/off is not complicated.HEART RATE is accurate. I have tested it against my garmin, two blood pressure devices, and a doctors appointment. All saying the same.Also, I the voice assistant is great. You can choose GOOGLE Assistant, OR Alexa. This is why selecting most recent reviews on this sort of stuff is important, as the early release of Sense did not have Google Assistant, but would soon with an update. True, and they followed through as I have it.AT THIS TIME, I have ZERO issues, concerns with this Fitbit Sense. I will be back to update as I learn more, or if I have anything worth sharing that is bad. I keep up with my reviews as needed.']"

However, that did NOT work. It didn't recognize most of my dumbbell exercises, and a lot of the ones that it guessed were wrong. The ones that it actually recognized were a slim minority of the exercises that I actually did. I also would get messages throughout the day on my phone that there was an error, that the watch disconnected and then another message later saying that it connected again. It usually wasn't long before it reconnected, maybe a few minutes, but I don't think it counts anything while it's disconnected. The phone and the watch were in the same room some of the time when this would happen, and it still would disconnect sometimes. Overall, I think it's a good watch, with lots of sports modes to track all kinds of activities, but it don't get it for strength training. I then decided to return this and get the mini version, since the main difference seemed to be the auto-recognition of strength training exercises, but that one performed SUBSTANTIALLY worse.

While I would love an Apple Watch, the need to charge every day is not ideal.  I don\'t want to have to add charging my watch each day to the many other things I have to remember to do.  So, I decided to try this Amazfit GTS 2 Mini. It is among the thinnest and lightest of smart watches, and I didn\'t want anything bulky on my arm.I\'m really happy with it so far!  It has taken about four days to really play with it and understand all that it can do.  For instance, today, i just discovered that I can create customized watch faces.  I thought I was stuck with the pre-made ones in their watch store.  This really makes me feel like I can make the watch very personalized to me.I really like the long battery life.  I also like how immediately and quickly it syncs.  It used to take my old fitbits FOREVER to sync. I love that I can customize the shortcuts to only see the features I want in the order I want.  I love that I could customize the app to hide the features I won\'t use and put the features I will use in the order in which I want to see them.  I really like the countdown app, the cycle tracker, the meditation breathing,  the sleep tracking, the heart rate monitor, step tracker, the weather (although it could be more self-explanatory), the ability to control sound and move forward/backwards when playing music, podcasts, or other audio from my iphone.My favorite feature is that I can have a plain digital clock display with the date, day, and steps when the screen is off.  That was the feature that sold me on the watch!The screen is also beautiful.  The band is quite plain-looking relative to the beauty of the watch, but I\'m just ordering a nicer band to put on it.I got all of these many new features in a device that still cost much less than what I was paying for those Fitbits!!I\'m giving it four stars only because I had a few glitches that I hope won\'t become long-term issues.  One issue was that some of the notifications weren\'t coming through.  However, after restarting and changing a setting on my phone, it has been back to working fine.  The other issue was that after a day or two the digital clock was not displaying when the screen was off.  I\'m not sure if that was a watch system issue or if I have a setting somewhere that was not configured properly.It does have Alexa (to provide text-based responses), but I disabled it.  It only seemed to work when you have the Zepp app open on the phone.  Doing that would get so cumbersome that it would defeat the purpose of having it readily available on the watch.Overall, I am very happy with this watch!UPDATE:  I\'m actually bumping to five stars.  I am so much happier with this watch than my old Fitbits.  The screen is gorgeous.  I realized that I wasn\'t getting the digital screen-off clock because the watch turns it off when it thinks I\'m sleeping.  After I wake and get moving, it starts displaying again.  Neat! The displays of notifications are still unclear to me, and it can\'t get the weather for the exact place where I live (only for the next county over).  Still, I\'m really happy with this watch given its price and the other options out there on the market. I notice that I\'m using the meditation/breathing bubble app quite often!SECOND UPDATE: They need a better instruction manual for this watch.  Just when I think I had discovered all that it can do, I come across other features that I didn\'t know about.  I didn\'t realize that all of the watch faces can come with their own screen off watch faces.  Also, the watch faces you customize have their own bare bones screen off watch face (so that you can get the color of text you want for the screen off face). Being able to customize the screen off watch face has been awesome!  I also had not understood the ""lit when wrist lift"" setting.  I now have that off, which is what I prefer.  Realizing these functions saves battery life and helps me customize the watch even more to my style and liking.  As for battery life, in the first week, I got a little over four days of battery life on a full charge. However, I was playing with it a lot and I had not realized how to use the ""lit when lift wrist"" function.  Now that I turned off the ""lit when lift wrist function,"" I\'m getting longer battery life. Even happier with my watch!']"

EL material es de excelente calidad, muy cómodo, fácil de usar, incluye las dos correas. Lo único desfavorable son las caratulas; no son caras, pero la variedad esta en la app. Me parece una excelente compra.', 'Lo que me encanta del reloj es sin duda su bateria. Por lo regular lo utilizo para hacer ejercicio minimo dos veces al dia con el gps activo y el monitoreo cardiaco encendido, y lo uso durante todo el dia en el trabajo y en la casa ya que es un accesorio con una estetica excelente. Con todo este uso lo termino cargando aproximadamente una hora cada domingo por la tarde mientras me relajo en mi casa y a veces le dura incluso mas la bateria.Ademas, todos los dias recibo cumplidos por lo bien que me veo con este reloj, ya que va completamente con mi estilo de vestimenta. Y siempre puedo confiar en ver las notificaciones de mi celular sin tener que sacarlo.Lo tengo emparejado a mi Huawei P30 pro y su funcion de encontrar telefono es bastante precisa y funcional.Otra cosa que me hizo escoger este smartwatch es la capacidad de recibir llamadas gracias a su altavoz y microfono que funcionan muy bien estando en lugares cerrados. En cambio, a la intemperie me costo bastante escuchar a la persona que me estaba hablando pero esto no es gran problema, simplemente saque mi celular y recibi la llamada ahi. Igual me encanto la posibilidad de poder hablar desde mi reloj cuando tengo las dos manos ocupadas.La unica razon por la que le doy 4 estrellas es porque a veces falla su monitoreo de ritmo cardiaco. Pero en general este es un gran reloj. Despues de hacer una investigacion muy exhaustiva sobre el mejor smatwatch al mejor precio llegue a la conclusion de que este es el elegido. Algunos de mis compañeros de trabajo se arrepienten de haber gastado dinero en su smartwatch de otras marcas. Yo, estoy completamente satisfecho con mi compra y me encanta lucir mi reloj en cualquier evento.

He tenido un par de smartwatches, este ya es mi 4o. reloj inteligente y por mucho es el mejor de todos los que he tenido.Tiene funciones enfocadas al deporte, como es el nivel de oxigenación, el seguimiento del ritmo cardiaco durante todo el día, actividad del sueño, quema de calorías, registro de ejercicios (un gran catálogo), gps, información del clima, además de funciones complementarias que interactúan con el teléfono, como son las notificaciones, el manejo de la música y recepción de llamadas, eso sí no puedes interactuar directamente con el teléfono desde el reloj, su uso es más bien independiente y complementario para desde el reloj llevar registro de tu actividad y transferirla al teléfono por medio de la aplicación Health de Huawei.Aquí cabe aclarar algo, debido al veto que ha impuesto EEUU a la compañía, al menos en android, tienes que descargar la aplicación HMS desde otra fuente, ya sea desde el navegador web o mediante la tienda de aplicaciones de huawei, ya que la ofrecida en playstore no está actualizada pero una vez instalada el reloj funcionará de maravilla y la app Huawei Healt si que se mantiene actualizada en el Playstore, además de que si tienes otros dispositivos como las básculas inteligentes de la marca, también podrás llevar tu registro desde la misma aplicación.', 'El producto llegó en perfecto estado. Está prácticamente nuevo. La caja un poco dañada pero no es ningún problema.', 'El reloj llego en el tiempo indicado, en su estuche y cumple muy bien con lo ofrecido. Muchas gracias', ""Fitness and health track everything I throw at it.  I walk, run, hike, swim, strength train, and push ups.  It also tracks my sleep quality and patterns, stress levels, and heart rate.  It reminds me to get up and stretch.  This thing is well built and speedy.  For tracking numbers, I look more for consistency as opposed to outright accuracy.  I don't have anything that I personally compare it to, so it fully meets my expectations.I like the speaker and mic.  Hey it allows me to talk on the phone in a pinch.  Finally, the best thing has to be the battery life, a real game changer.  It uses in my estimate between 7 to 12% of juice per day depending on levels of activity.  This is just wonderful as I keep the watch on 22/7 and don't have any battery anxiety.  Highly recommend.  I'd like to see more watch faces added from the current 15.  Some of the reviewers want more smart features amongst other things, something to keep in mind to find the right watch for you.  I am happy as is.  Probably not having the whole kitchen sink of apps at the ready has something to do with the design intentions.  Mine is sync'd to Samsung Galaxy S10, the always-on turned on, and get pre selected notifications.  I've never experienced Bluetooth connection issues.  This is my 1st ever smartwatch.  Why did I wait so long.  Along with the smart scale these tools supplement my desire for a healthy lifestyle in 2020.  Btw I was looking to get a smart band at 1st but this worked out as it is both a health tracker and an attractive smart and light weight watch.""]"

Non si sincronizza (o si sincronizza in maniera estremamente difficoltosa). All’inizio della mia esperienza d’uso, per sincronizzarsi totalmente impiegava in media una quindicina di tentativi. (ma c’è stata una volta in cui ne ha necessitati 21). A sincronizzazione avvenuta poi NON manteneva la connessione con lo smartphone: continue cadute, riconnessioni e diversi riavvii automatici. Tutto questo lo rendeva inutilizzabile (o ne rendeva l’utilizzo estremamente spiacevole, complicato e limitato).Proprio quando mi ero deciso ad effettuare il reso … è arrivato l’aggiornamento che HA RISOLTO ogni problema.Forse Garmin è stata troppo frettolosa ad immettere sul mercato un device con un firmware ancora instabile … fatto sta che comunque l’azienda alla fine si è dimostrata seria come sempre e quindi ha risolto il problema.Ora arriviamo ai PRO:Estetica: ovviamente è soggetta ai gusti personali ma, a mio modo di vedere, è davvero bello!È leggerissimo.Nella sua semplicità trasmette una sensazione di oggetto ben realizzato.È uno smartwatch essenziale. NON ha millemila funzioni che tanto, diciamocelo, non guarderemo mai (a dire il vero non ne ha neanche poche eh) ma monitora tutto quello che realmente serve … come ad esempio: battiti, pO2, calorie giornaliere, passi, sonno, acqua assunta durante la giornata e parecchie attività fisiche.La cosa estremamente buona è che LE MISURAZIONI SONO DAVVERO OTTIME E ATTENDIBILI. Per esempio: questo smartwatch NON ha il GPS integrato (a meno che non si condivida quello dello smartphone) e ho messo a confronto la sua rilevazione con quella del Garmin Fenix 7 (che penso sia il top dei top e che ovviamente ha il GPS). Ebbene … dopo 10 km di camminata, solo tramite il conteggio dei passi, si è discostato dalla rilevazione del Fenix 7 di soli novanta metri circa: un risultato davvero eccellente (anche perché non è stato un caso isolato ma in diverse occasioni mi ha dimostrato di avere un margine di errore estremamente basso). Stesso discorso, ad esempio, per la saturazione dell’ossigeno: misurazioni in linea con quelle del Fenix 7 … che comunque, ad onestà intellettuale, solitamente hanno sempre una leggera sottostima (messi a confronto con un pulsossimetro propriamente detto intendo … ma una volta che si conosce questa lieve sottostima, questo rappresenta comunque un parametro misurato con una certa affidabilità e coerenza).Un discorso in linea con quanto espresso sopra può essere fatto per tutte le altre rilevazioni: MOLTO MOLTO AFFIDABILI (mi ha sorpreso in positivo).In sostanza, se può piacere esteticamente, è un prodotto assolutamente VALIDO!Gli ho dato 4 stelle e non 5 per il problema iniziale. Fosse stato sin da subito com’è adesso, 5 stelle se le sarebbe meritate tutte.', ""Montre très belle aux multiples fonctionsSeul problème ce n'est pas le bon cordon d'alimentation.J'utilise celui de mon mari qui a aussi une montre Garmin Instinct"", 'Pulito, elegante, piccolo. Tre caratteristiche che ho apprezzato moltissimo in questo ibrido. Dai faccio una lista pro e contro che è simpaticaPRO- Design. Minimal, bellissimo, e potrei ripetermi all\'infinito. Il quadrante è uno spettacolo- App. Da non sottovalutare, Garmin ha un\'ottima app, una delle più complete che abbia mai visto. Forse non intuitiva al massimo, ma tante funzionalità richiedono un po\' di esplorazione prima di ricordarsi dove sono- Batteria. Uno dei motivi per cui ho scelto questo orologio, 6 giorni tenendo le notifiche push disattivate, ma collegato via bluetooth col telefono h24 e tutti i sensori accesi- Materiali/qualità costruttiva. Di una leggerezza disarmante, che allo stesso tempo rimanda una sensazione di solidità molto forte. Il cinturino va di pari passo con la cassa, leggero, resistente, con una texture semplice ma gradevole al tatto, che anche dopo aver sudato o fatto la doccia non rilascia cattivi odori a contatto con la pelle. Una chicca è nel ""passante"" del cinturino: ha un dentino che si incastra nei buchi, impedendogli di scivolare via come in un qualunque orologio. Ho apprezzato moltoCONTRO- Imprecisioni. Rileva i dati del sonno in maniera corretta, ma poi nel resoconto delle ore totali di sonno nella app Garmin conta anche il tempo in cui sono a letto senza dormire. Se passo una notte insonne ma fermo, pensa che io abbia dormito 9 ore. Avevo una semplice mi band da 27€ e il periodo di risveglio lo sottraeva perfettamente alle ore totali di riposo- Ricarica. L\'attacco per la ricarica non è magnetico, ma è un attacco proprietario scomodissimo. Di scomodo c\'è che bisogna controllare che sia effettivamente collegato, tutto qua. Porta un pensiero in più.- Leggibilità delle lancette. In mia opinione un orologio ibrido è sinonimo di versatile, e una chicca in più verso la conquista della versatilità massima sarebbe stato mettere dei dettagli fluorescenti alle lancette, visto che sono fisiche e non digitali. Di notte sono obbligato a risvegliare il display se voglio sapere che ore sono.- Sveglia. Questa è una cosa che proprio non mi spiego. Allora, ci sono tre livelli di intensità di vibrazione che si possono regolare direttamente dall\'orologio. Dov\'è il problema? Che questa regolazione non influisce sulla sveglia, che sceglie di vibrare indipendentemente dai settaggi al livello minimo, e giuro che è impercettibile. In altre parole, è una sveglia che non mi sveglia perché è troppo delicata. Allo stesso tempo, per le notifiche la vibrazione è potentissima.', 'Nachdem meine vivosport leider das Zeitliche gesegnet hat, suchte ich einen Nachfolger, natürlich bei Garmin. Die vivosport gibt es leider nicht mehr, die vivosmart war mir zu teuer im Vergleich zur vivosport, so fiel meine Wahl auf die vivomove Sport in schwarz, meine inzwischen dann 5. Garmin.Der erste Eindruck war erst mal sehr positiv, die Optik des Ziffernblatts ist sehr stylish.Dann die erste Ernüchterung. Obwohl ich alle Schritte wie im Handbuch beschrieben durchgeführt habe und mein Smartphone und die Garmin Connect App die Uhr problemlos via Bluetooth finden, gelang es mir nicht die Uhr mit dem Phone zu koppeln. Auch mit Abarbeitung der gesamten von Garmin vorgegebenen Fehlerprotokolle nicht. Ein Koppeln am Rechner mittels Garmin Express war dagegen problemlos möglich. Nach mehr als 90 Minuten(!!!) in der Garmin Kundenservice Hotline hatte ich einen Mitarbeiter, der meine Meldung aufnahm und feststellte, dass es in den letzten Tagen mehrere Kundenreklamationen mit dem gleichen Fehler gab, mir jedoch nicht weiterhelfen konnte.Nichtdestotrotz wollte ich der Garmin eine Chance geben. Da ich die Uhr nicht mit dem GPS des Phones koppeln kann => die Kilometerermittlung z.B. beim Gehen zeigt eine mehr als 20%ige Abweichung zur vivosport. Obwohl die Uhr ein im Vergleich zu vivosport und vivosmart riesiges Display hat, steht nur ein winziger Bereich für die Tracking bzw Aktivitäts Anzeigen zur Verfügung. Beim Einrichten der Uhr mittels Fingerspitze (Wischen und Tippen) kommt es dadurch immer wieder zu Fehleingaben und man muss teilweise das ganze Menü durchtippen, um wieder in den gewünschten Einstellbereich zu kommen. Für meinen Geschmack ist der Einstellbereich zu klein dargestellt, auch viel zu überladen und für mich ohne (Lese)brille nicht ablesbar. Wie das beim Sport funktionieren soll, kann ich mir im Moment nicht vorstellen.Nächster Schwachpunkt ist der fehlende Barometersensor um die gestiegenen Stockwerke zu ermitteln. Bei dem Preis der Uhr hätte das durchaus drin sein dürfen.Das tagsüber schön anzuschauende Display lässt sich leider nicht beleuchten, d.h. die Ablesbarkeit im Dunkeln ist...0!Natürlich kann man die kleine Anzeige durch Antippen aktivieren, diese ist aber für mich leider nicht ohne Brille ablesbar. Das kleine Display ließe sich auch über die Armbewegung aktivieren. Diese Funktion habe ich aber nach wenigen Stunden deaktiviert, da mich die Zeigerbewegung der ""analogen"" Anzeige bei der Aktivierung des Displays (die beiden Zeiger bewegen sich dann wie von Zauberhand auf 3 bzw 9 Uhr) tagsüber irritiert haben und ich die Zeit dann ohne Brille auch nicht mehr ablesen konnte.Fazit: eine auf den ersten Blick optisch sehr gelungene Uhr (deshalb 2 Sterne, statt nur einem), leider mit großen Schwächen bei der Darstellung der Aktivitätsanzeigen, und sie lässt sich für mich nicht mit dem Phone koppeln, womit ihre Funktion als Smartwatch nicht gegeben ist => geht leider zurück', ""The Smart Watch has left me truly impressed with its remarkable capabilities and versatility.What sets this smartwatch apart is its ability to seamlessly integrate into various aspects of daily life.

I have owned it for a month now and so far I have almost nothing to complain about. I was a bit worried about it\'s size before buying, since my wrist is neither small nor huge, just average. But since there was a good deal at the time, I decided to take the risk and shop online without comparing 5 plus and 5x plus sizes. Couldn\'t be happier! The 51mm case works perfectly for me. I have to be honest that I\'m used to wearing Casio G-Shocks, which are kinda bulky, but unless you have a small wrist, 5x plus will fit just fine. Aside from the included Silicone band, I got a Slate Gray stainless steel band from a local store. The metal band makes the watch look like another watch, would definitely recommend. Sometimes I forget to put the silicone band on and go run with the steel one, it feels kinda loosy and you don\'t feel the vibrate alerts so much, but all and all, it\'s alright. Also, the quick release feature is awesome!If you have the budget for a sapphire crystal lens, I would very much recommend getting it. Definitely go for it! You are very likely for hit doorways, desks, car doors and etc with your watch when wearing it all day long. I\'ve seen people complain about the glass getting scratched a week after purchasing the watch.The watch interface is sometimes too complex, with too many options. You will have to go through a lot of menus and press the buttons a lot of times to get the settings right. But most settings can be done through the Connect app on your phone, so it\'s not a big deal. I have seen a guy say the watch connectivity is not reliable, but I have not had this problem whatsoever. If I leave my phone in my room and go to the kitchen, it displays ""disconnected"". As soon as I return to my room, it says ""connected"". No problem at all. Sync with connect app works just fine, nothing to complain.I have not tried navigation yet, but managed to install better maps for my region quite easily. Just google installing maps and you\'ll see that it is quite easy.As for the watch features, here goes my reviews:-Battery duration is awesome, in my opinion. I leave the 24/7 wrist heart rate monitor on and the battery last for more than 10 days.-GPS + Glonass setting works very fine, although I don\'t seem to see any difference between GPS only-Garmin Pay does not work in my country (no banks support it), so if this feature is what makes you choose a watch, check compatibility beforehand. There is a link in garmin\'s website.-Pulseox meter seems kinds useless if you are not hiking big altitudes, which is my case. So I just leave it off for battery saving.-Spotify compatibility works fine, but I had a little trouble connecting my wireless earbuds. Had to go to a place with little signal interference (away from other bluetooth devices, wireless networks and specially my phone), Only then the watch successfully connect to the earbuds.-Original Garmin watch faces are great and very customizable. Connect IQ Store also offers a big variety of watch faces.-As for running/activity tracking, I don\'t think there is any better equipment. It give you tons of metrics (steps, calories, all-day heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen levels, all-day stress levels, VO2 max, Lactate threshold, weight tracking, sleep monitoring, training effect, performance condition and a lot more).-Smart notifications are handy if you like them. You can see who is calling you, read messages, reply with pre-defined text. I don\'t think you can compare the smartwatch functionalities of a Apple Watch or Samsung smartwatch, but overall, they are fine. This watch is made for sports, not smartwatch stuff.  I turned the notifications off because they bother me all day long, only left call notification on when I\'m running, if I happen to be with my phone, of course.-I have not tested the wrist heart rate monitor while exercising, I just use the heart rate monitor strap.Overall, I\'m very impressed with the watch. Would definitely recommend it, even though it is pricey. As someone said on his review ""Pricey? Heck yeah. Worth every penny? YES - I can\'t recommend this watch enough. Eat beans for a month or two and get the watch."". This couldn\'t be more true.', 'Excelente calidad, a veces es demorado para tomar la señal GPS', '12/10/18 UpdateTitanium bezel I have to question as really titanium as it is so soft it is marking up and frankly looks bad just months after purchasing this watch,  and I am not rough on it. Taking another star off for lame materials in what is supposed to be a premium product.11/01/18 UpdateSo I will take a  star off as the battery is not living up to what the marketing states.I noticed I was charging the watch a lot, but I was running and using music so it didn\'t phase me.  I\'ve not run in the last 2 weeks and decided to watch battery life.  At best I  get 6 days on a charge where Garmin states 12 days in smart watch mode.  I am not someone always on their phone, nor do I send/receive dozens of texts a day, it should not be that far off.Oh watch faces can impact your battery life. No problem I will grab a Garmin watch face, unfortunately I can\'t find one where the minute hand actually shows consistently which is well documented by the user community, yet Garmin doesn\'t fix them.On my comment about needing to grab a golf course in advance of playing was not accurate. The one course we play each week did not come up on the watch so I went to the app, but all other courses I played were on the watch.Golf is okay not great because it auto-advances the hole on you at odd times.  In the middle of the hole, up by the green, on the tee box, etc.  If you use the watch to score, you screw around with getting the watch to the correct hole, then enter your score, then get it to the correct hole.Running and music has been great.  My Jabra  earbuds stay connected and the tracking/ stats are awesome.We were recently in the mountains,  and the altimeter was almost dead on to actual elevation (checked against a helicopter altimeter dialed in to the barometric pressure), and the trail tracking with step/heart rate was very cool.I\'ll stick to my original title of near perfect, but shame on Garmin for marketing battery life that is not even close.Original review below:The Fenix 5 Plus is the first of the Fenix line to come with music built into the watch.  I actually had ordered a Fenix 5X about 2 weeks before this device was announced and returned it, as music in my device is one of those check off items.We are a running, hiking, golf, and swimming type of family, and I like to run 5-6 miles a few times a week, and believe it or not this is my first Garmin device (I\'ve been using Polar).Why this device over the 5x?  I like to wear as few devices as possible when I run.  Now with the 5 plus I wear the watch, my Jabra Sport Elite bluetooth earbuds, and sunglasses.  Tracking is excellent and there are a ton of metrics for each run (too many to list, look at the product specs), plus the music streaming to the buds was perfect, never a dropped moment.  I use Google Play for my music, and you simply need to load it manually on to the watch via USB cable.Oh and I did take it golfing already to my local course.  You need to plan a little in advance as you need to download the course before you play, but that isn\'t a big deal to me as you can do it via your smartphone or PC/MAC USB cable.  Distances were accurate and on many holes I did find the center of the green on the device.Battery life is excellent even with runs/music in use...I can say ""days"" but haven\'t tried to totally drain the battery yet.  So far I have gone 5 days and 2 runs and it was still 37% when I plugged it in.Why is it so excellent?  The stuff you need to accept and get used to helps the battery life.The vibrant contrast they show in the promotional photos is NOT the screen you get.  I wish they would post some realistic looking photos of the screen as it is not backlit, and when you do push the back light button, it looks more like the 80\'s LCD watches than a modern smartwatch.  The only time this screen is close the promotional photos is outside as it uses bright light to reflect and illuminate the screen.  So battery life is really long because there is no lamp on for the screen...unless you push a button (there is a gesture setting where if you twist your wrist the back light will automatically come on, however you use it so infrequently I turned this setting off).This is not a touchscreen watch, you use buttons to control all functions.  Actually after going through a few Google Wear devices, I am actually okay with a non-touch screen.  The 5 buttons allow you to navigate wherever you need, and there are much fewer navigation errors using buttons over the sometime twitchy touchscreens.The navigation I am still not used to it.  The primary buttons there is a light, up/menu, down, enter, and previous screen.  When I went to start my first run, I launched the run app, then selected the screen I wanted to see, and could not figure out how to start the run after the GPS locked in.  After some fumbling I figured it out, but I am a computer gadget nerd and I am having a few issues...to the non-nerd this thing may be too many button sequences to figure out.I would give it a 5 out of 5 if this very expensive sports watch had some honest photos of what customers will see, and if the navigation was cleaner using the buttons.  It is a kitchen sink device and so far working great...but it better for the money they want for it!!', ""I've only had this watch for a few weeks, but it has already met all my expectations. The GPS and sport trackers are really helpful for outdoor/indoor sports. I paddle in all salt water conditions and it appears to hold up well."", 'I recently upgraded to the Fenix 5 Plus, having been using the Fenix 3 for a couple of years.  I\'ve been very pleased with the upgrade -- it was nice to get a Fenix that fit my wrist better (I chose the ""middle"" size).  I really haven\'t had much use for the leather strap that came with the watch, though it fit fine -- it was easy to switch to the more water-resistant silicon band that also came with it, and I just wear that all the time.The controls throughout all of the built-in apps are definitely improved over the Fenix 3, including better support for laps and sets (if that\'s your thing).  I found many of the default settings to be annoying (it really tried to sell you hard on the lap counting, for example), but it was fairly easy to turn them off.  Like the Fenix 3, the music controls don\'t work with my preferred music player, Poweramp (except volume), but that\'s more likely the fault of Poweramp than the Fenix.  The bluetooth support is very good, and unlike the Fenix 3, the Fenix 5 doesn\'t ""eat"" text messages, so that it\'s possible to be notified of texts and VIP e-mail on your watch and still also get the message to your hands-free car system.As far as heartrate monitoring goes -- there\'s good news and bad news.  The monitoring is clearly improved over the Fenix 3 -- more consistent and more accurate.  For running, biking, hiking, walking, and other ""leg"" sports it\'s perfectly fine, and it seems to be good for many calisthenics as well.  However,  for any sport that requires you to swing your arms fast or which requires you to elevate your hands over your head repeatedly, it\'s still wildly inaccurate.  For example, the fenix 5 clocks my heartrate at 75 bpm when benchpressing or doing chin-ups, when in fact I\'m actually hitting about 150bpm. To be fair, there\'s not much Garmin can do to fix that -- such exercises cause massive fluctuations in the size of the veins of your wrist which confuse the monitor, and other monitors I\'ve used (the Microsoft Band v1 and v2) had exactly the same problem.  For weightlifting, chinups, and pushups, I now use a chest strap paired to the fenix, which works fine (though before exercising, make *sure* the chest strap is paired by looking at the watch\'s settings -- the chest strap has no way to tell you that it\'s battery is low or dead!).  As I say above, you don\'t need the chest strap for running, but if you use it anyway, be sure to put a cotton pad under the latch -- the nylon piece covering the latch may otherwise chafe your skin.One other ""bad"" thing -- unlike the fenix 3, the fenix 5 doesn\'t come with a fast charge adapter.  (I plus mine into the one that came with the fenix 3, and presumably any reputable fast charge adapter will work fine.)  I also bought some caps for the charge port on the watch (they are very inexpensive), since no caps came with it and I was worried about sweat getting on the pins.But all-in-all, I really like the fenix 5 and I\'m glad I upgraded.  I rely on it heavily during the day for both exercising and getting messages and other information.', ""In my opinion, this Fenix 5 Plus offers more features that the average fitness aficionado would ever need, and with all those features comes a  fairly steep learning curve, especially for one just entering the fitness tracking world.  I really like that my particular watch holds over 700 songs, even though the manual says it will hold 500 - I originally had 800 songs to import and pared the list down to about 700, so who knows, maybe it would have held 800.  The Garmin Pay feature in theory is great, but I haven't had a chance to use it yet - everywhere I've been so far while wearing it hasn't accepted touchless payment.  The amount of stats available after a workout is staggering.  I've only had the watch about a month and still playing with the stats, but the mapping and workout statistics are very comprehensive for walking, running and biking - the only workouts I've used with the Fenix 5 plus.  GPS satellite acquisition is super fast, but the Bluetooth signal is very weak - the Fenix 5 plus pairs nicely and easily with a set of wireless earbuds, but the antenna is in the right bud, and I wear the watch on my left wrist, so terrible reception - I have to wear the right bud in my left ear to be closer to the watch - not a problem, but I would have thought the signal would be at least able to reach the other side of my body.  Nice selection of watch faces and widgets through the ConnectIQ store, however the weather apps I've tried so far really do not impress.  If there is a way for the Garmin Fenix 5 Plus to read weather from my iPhone, I believe the issue would be fixed.  Currently you have to add an API code to the weather apps, and receiving regular weather updates requires wifi and GPS readings, plus an activity is required to be started for some apps/widgets.  Many more  weather options with Garmin than with the Apple Watch, but the Apple Watch functions much more seamlessly.  I've worn an Apple Watch since the 1st edition, and am now wearing the Fenix 5 Plus every day.  I would guess the biggest drawback for most is the price, at almost $400 during Prime Days - don't know if I would have purchased if it wasn't on sale - I wanted the 5X Plus or 6X, but couldn't justify the expense as a newcomer to the fitness training world.  I have until January to return, but I believe I will stay with it."", 'I am upgrading from a forerunner 235 which I loved. The 235 was a great watch to track my running and workouts, however I was won over by the maps and music of the new Fenix 5x plus. In my first week I’ve done 4 runs from 7-10 miles jogs to sprint workouts, yoga and even some point plotting around town to test out the maps.GPS:I haven’t noticed much difference in my GPS function between the 235 and 5x plus. The GPS is found slightly faster but that’s about it.Maps:I am in Africa and I have rudimentary maps on my device. I will be returning to the states in a few weeks and I will be able to test the North American maps at that time. In the mean time it’s good as an emergency device for me.Music: I have only used the music while I run outdoors and use my phone when I’m in the gym working out and on the treadmill, I do notice some drop off with my jay birds when they are initially paired but it goes away in a minute or two. I have also noticed that my Spotify playlist doesnt stay on the device if I switch over to my iTunes music and so I had to re sync the playlist to my device, not a deal breaker but just a nuanced thing about the device. Perhaps they will fix this over time with software updates.Battery7 days in and the battery is just under 40% which is good in my opinion, however I am curious to see how long it will last before the battery runs out. If it lasts 12-14 days I will be content with that, as it works with how I use the watch. I’ll have to take it off at some point I suppose. When I start training up for my aspiring Ultra running hobby I will see how the battery holds up over time, until then a few 10 milers and sprint workouts aren’t draining the battery too much.Size:I’m 5,7 and 170lbs I lift 4 times a week and run/ruck several miles a week, I’ve worn heavier items on my person than this watch. Was it heavier that my 235 yes and was it noticeable at first yes, but I got used to it after my first few days and now I barely notice it. Also I wear it on my day to day with t shirts, jeans and non running shoes or long sleeve shirt, pants and boots and it rarely looks out of place or bulky. I wouldn’t push it with business casual or a full suit but that’s my opinion.I hope this helps someone, I am not a triathlete or marathoner, I’m just a regular guy who needs to workout to stay fit his job and gets to travel a lot so I think this device with its features fits the lifestyle.', 'I purchased this Garmin fenix 5 Plus Sapphire watch on March 6th and have been wearing every day since.  Over the years I have worn fitness watches from Polar, Timex Ironman, and the Whoop fitness band (which I thought was fantastic, but I couldn\'t stand the $30 monthly access fee).  I have to say this this thing is the absolute BEST as it so functional for me.  You can prioritize your sports and fitness activities so that you don\'t have to fumble with all of the settings to get to the ones you want.For the past two years i have been using a Garmin eTrex on my mountain bike with an ANT+ connection to an chest strap HR monitor and bluetooth to Garmin Connect & Strava integration.  Being able to ditch the chest strap with the Fenix has been a total delight.  There seems to be a bit of delay in my HR during workouts, but the Fenix catches up within a few seconds and its recording everything with decent accuracy.  I have been running both the Fenix and eTrex simultaneously on MTB rides to evaluate the GPS accuracy, integration with Garmin Connect, and it\'s really good with no perceptible difference between the two.I feel like i have put this watch through its paces and it is so impressive on so many levels.  Battery life is great particularly when you compare it to an Apple Watch (meh).  I think I have been charging the Fenix once every 9 or 10 days and use the GPS for 4-6 hours a week during MTB rides and rowing.  the other thing the Fenix does really well is integrate with Garmin Reach, so if you are interested in connecting your personal EPIRB to the Fenix, no problem.  Get messages while you are out in your kayak, snowshoeing in the backcountry, or hiking at night.  The Sapphire crystal face is holding up great with no scratches or issues.This thing is great and you won\'t be disappointed.  Lastly, all of this COVID-19 quarantining has me spending way too much time in my home office and the ""Get up and Move"" reminders, steps, stair flights, etc. really let\'s you know when it\'s time to get off your fat a** and move around:)  I\'m such a fan and looking forward to see how this Garmin holds up over the long term.', 'Let\'s get some of this device\'s real problems out of the way because these are an integral aspect of owning a Fenix 5 Plus.  So I\'m 10 yards from the end of an 80-minute run, anticipating maybe a personal record.  Glancing down at my handy new Garmin Fenix 5 Plus, I see the Garmin Blue Triangle. Yes, that\'s right --my handy endurance aid resets just at the end of my run.  Did I achieve a personal record? We shall never know because the watch wanted to update some maps.The Blue Triangle problem occurs rarely, but the watch has a keen sense for anticipating when a random reset will provoke the maximum amount of irritation in its owner. It is really an inexcusable problem and I shudder for someone who is relying on this device out in the wilderness somewhere as it happens. And this is supposed to be ""hiker\'s watch"" right? Well, the altimeter is unreliable. Today, while running on the beach, I checked the altimeter which claimed I was at 323 feet although the ocean on my shoes made it pretty clear I was at sea-level.Most inexcusable: The compass does not work accurately and does not easily recalibrate --I\'ve only got it to recalibrate properly once out of about 200 efforts. Is my experience unusual? Unfortunately, no. See on-line inquiries for details.Another annoyance is occasionally attempting to download an application or widget and being informed the watch is out of memory, despite verification that memory is only at half of capacity. I called Garmin to ask how to address this problem, and they unhelpfully suggested erasing the entire watch and starting from scratch. Ultimately, I tinkered with some of the apps and widgets through my computer, and got it to work, but this sort of bug should not be an issue with a 16 gigabyte watch and a few tiny megabyte widgets.Some of the widgets do not work consistently, either. For example, Intensity Minutes, the number of minutes you\'ve done vigorous exercise, sometimes fails to register. On some weeks, I\'m only given credit for running, with a complete omission for cycling even though my cycling workouts are far more rigorous with far higher heart rates and energy expended. I cannot determine how to fix this problem and it is widely experienced by other users.Some additional features in need of either revamping or fixing: I\'ve noticed 30-bpm or higher discrepancies between what my heart rate strap and Garmin Fenix on-board heart rate monitor measure when cycling. Nowadays, electronic cycling components send a heads-up message to devices like this Garmin that a battery is near-drained. Not so with the Garmin heart rate straps--you might be in the middle of an activity when it simply stops recording because the battery is dead. Occasionally, notifications from the phone cannot be dismissed unless one\'s phone is reset. The music feature is a nice idea, but the specter of an unbroken connection to wireless buds is going to test your patience. And finding a vendor who accepts Garmin Pay is going to be more challenging than the event you just finished.When it works, which is most of the time, this is a great training aid with great flexibility. The vibration feature is just tactile enough to work perfectly for pace-setting; and the ability to set timers for any manner of intervals, walk-runs, etc. is terrific. The weight of the titanium-finished version with silicone strap (a bit over 60 grams) is virtually unnoticed on the wrist during aerobic activities, despite the sapphire crystal. The newer silicone straps, incidentally, have a smoother finish than the prior Garmin Fenix 5 version, don\'t collect dirt as easily, and seem a bit more durable. The buttons have a snappy tactile feedback and the screen delay is usually minimal. Some have complained about the screen\'s resolution, but it serves its sporting purposes well, even with some of the fairly intricate watch faces currently available.The map features work remarkably well for hiking, with trails marked in the same manner that highways and roads are marked for standard GPS systems. Recently, our family took an excursion on several trail in the Big Sur area where there was no phone network service and no available paper trail maps, but my Fenix 5 Plus conveyed the trails clearly labelled and navigation was easy to use despite the maps\' small size. The GPS location spottings where accurate enough despite the tendency described above to not accurately measure altitude. So although it takes some time,  it is worth the effort to download the freely available maps and update these when available.Given its fairly substantial price, the Garmin Fenix 5 Plus has some indefensible quirks, but it is still an almost indispensable tool for studying and improving aerobic sports performance when it works.', 'UPDATE #2:Garmin support has really stepped up to the plate so I\'m changing my overall rating of the watch. They\'ve helped me resolve the connectivity and the gesture issues (resetting to default and start over with connecting watch). I\'m back to really liking the watch!UPDATE:The ""gesture"" still doesn\'t work properly, and now that I\'ve been able to wear the watch more often I\'ve noticed that the connection to my iPhone (via their app) is frequently disconnected (even though I\'m not ""that"" far away from the bluetooth connection), but more importantly, it doesn\'t reconnect automatically when I get back in ""range"". So, for example... I leave my watch on my desk, I go get a coffee and return to my desk. My watch doesn\'t reconnect unless I manually complete the reconnection. Where this sort of ""matters"" is that I like to get my email/text notifications on my watch... which can\'t happen unless I\'m connected.I emailed Garmin support on October 17. No response so I sent another email 2 weeks later. I just received my first email response now, and their only suggestion was to update my software (without even asking what software version I was running). I told them that the watch has been updated regularly since I took it out of the box (and that I\'ve set it to update automatically). So... add ""terrible support"" to the list of issues I\'m having with this rather expensive watch.[Here\'s my first review]First, I think this is a very nice watch. It seems loaded with features, looks great, and seems to be solidly built.Be forewarned though... the ""gesture"" feature (getting the dark watch face to illuminate when you move your arm upwards so that you can see the watch face) is VERY poor...  finicky... unpredictable. Apparently it\'s not ""just me"", as there\'s a lot of talk online about ""gesture"" not working right. I\'ve emailed Garmin support (twice) and never received a response.The fact that I can\'t get ""gesture"" to work properly definitely affected the number of stars I can give it in my personal review.']"

I bought Garmin Venu Sq for my brother, who has an android phone. First of all, if you are an iPhone user, go for Apple Watch, as they work great in Apple ecosystem, sync seamlessly, has great display and user friendly UI.Now coming to the Garmin Venu SQ, I will list out pros and cons.PROs:1) I had thoroughly researched about the accuracy of smartwatches, and found that Garmin is second only to Apple watches. Apple watches has near-industry level accuracy, whereas Garmin watches comes second. Fitbit comes a close 3rd, but with the constant nagging to get Fitbit premium, I did not even consider it. Samsung watches are good, but they are more of a smartwatch with few fitness functions, unlike Garmin which is basically a fitness device with few smartwatch functions. ACCURACY RATING: 9/102) Good enough sports modes, with customisable data fields for each mode. Tracking is expected to be accurate. SPORTS TRACKING: 9/103) Other measurement like body battery, stress level, steps were accurate enough for daily uses. 9/104) Battery life is good. Runs for roughly 5-6 days on average with continuous SpO2 tracking. BATTERY RATING: 9/105) Extremely well designed mobile application. Shows relevant information. Garmin Connect IQ store has decent collection of watch faces (round shape), widgets, apps, data fields, etc that can be downloaded. Extremely customisable to the point that you can even decide colours of data field. Apple should learn from it. APPS AND STORE RATINGS: 6/10 (Edit: After almost 1 year of use, now I am having issues with the syncing the data between mobile application and watch. Plus other brands have now caught up on application where they are no as good as Garmin. So decreasing this rating from 10 to 6) :/6) Syncing of data is instantaneous between app and watch. Sometimes I did face some issues. for e.g. when I downloaded watch faces, it would queue it up for no reason and then take some 2-3 minutes for it to reflect on watch. But other than this, no issues. SYNC RATING: 9/10CONs:1) First of all, its display. The display looks like it is a watch from early 2010s. The LCD display looks so washed out that it is difficult to see even in normal indoor lighting despite maxed out brightness setting. Let\'s not even talk about how it looks outdoor. I instantly hated the display the moment it was switched on. DISPLAY RATING: 3/102) One factor that could have compensated for the disappointing display is the watch faces. However, on the Garmin store, most of the watch faces is for round watches, not for square. If you install a watch face meant for round faces to Garmin Venu Sq, it gets stretched, and covers less that half of already small display size of Venu sq. All in all, there are hardly 5-6 watch faces that uses the whole screen on Venu Sq, but those faces are extremely ""boring"". The few faces which are good and needs to be purchased, are not available for purchase in India. So the display that my brother is using is the standard one that comes pre-installed in watch -  the washed out, hard to see display. WATCH FACES - 2/10 (particularly compared to it similarly priced Apple Watch Series 3 which has amazing watch face options with dynamic interactions)3) I did not find sleep tracking to be very accurate. Many YouTubers had the same experience. However, I will not complain much here since my almost double expensive Apple Watch does not even have inbuilt sleep tracking and has to use 3rd party apps. SLEEP TRACKING - 7/104) SpO2 reading - not very accurate. Sometimes shows accurate reading, sometimes its off by 3-4 % age points. All in all, do not rely on this watch\'s SpO2 reading and better to have a specialised device for that. (Again this is the issue with all SpO2 tracking smartwatches)5) Garmin Pay is not available in India.6) The raise-to-wake is decently responsive. But another biggest disappointment comes from double-tap to wake function. It doesn\'t work half of the time. I have to double-tap 2-3 times to wake it once. Even then sometimes it doesn\'t show anything. Then I have to press the physical button to wake it up. RESPONSIVENESS : 6/107) GPS sometimes doesn\'t gets locked in. But this is extremely rare.8) Other must have function like Flashlight is not present.So should you buy it?It depends on what you want, you age and preferences. Those of you who just want an accurate smartwatch and wants to get into ""Garmin ecosystem"", but does not care about display quality, watch faces, UI interactiveness, can go for it. However, those who have seen the interactiveness of Apple watches, or Fitbit or Samsung galaxy and active watches, may fight this watch ""boring"". If you have single minded focus of using this watch as a fitness device, then go for it. However, if you are looking for a smartwatch which can replace your mobile, take calls, reply texts, voice detection, this is not the watch for you.If in the future, vibrant colours and watch faces get available in the Garmin store specifically designed for Venu SQ, then this watch can become a decent choice to buy.', 'If you have never tried a Garmin watch and want a fitness tracker that is closer to a smartwatch then I highly recommend this. For the price I find it doing exceptionally well. A bit of downsides such as no OLED display and few features on the smartphone app are compensated by highly accurate wrist based HR monitor and Garmin\'s expert algorithms. I do not use its \'Garmin Pay\' feature. My rating is based on almost 8 months of continuous use and find it\'s ""Body battery"" feature as very useful. No discomfort at all while wearing it all the time. Delivers great 4-day battery back up which is a relief considering most other expensive trackers are not even closer. I chose this in comparison to Fitbit and Garmin\'s free features are adequate to help you get started. It\'s built-in GPS works very well. You might want to look for the upgraded Venu Sq 2 which is now available.', 'Its a very good watch with good gps accuracy. It supports GPS, Glonass, and Baidu. One thing which it lacks is screen size. It has very small screen size. Nevertheless, its a quite good smart watch.', ""I was looking for a fitness watch with good accuracy and this fits the bill perfectly. Battery life is good, as well as the user interface.  Don't go by folks cribbing about the user interface not being as snappy as that of iwatch, it isn't, just get on with it.  It does take a bit to get the GPS going before running, but the accuracy is pretty good. In summary, no complaints and I am happy user of the smart watch."", ""Nice watch but too expensive and it doesn't track all activities like rope jump and some others. Good for enthusiastic runners."", ""If you are looking for new age smart watch with cool features like amoled screen, Bluetooth calling, music, responsive screen and watch faces, this is not the watch for you.If you are interested in most accurate readings for health related activities like VO2 max, resting heart rate, GPS tracking for an activity, sleep tracking, then this watch is for you. This watch has more accuracy then Apple watch, I have it both and I have compared them thoroughly.So again, know before you buy. You won't be able to show off this watch to your friends as a 20k watch, it just doesn't look like it, but it does it's job excellently what it was made for."", ""This is a decent product but i think it's a bit outdated. Tracks sleep and steps very accurately but does not have many watch faces or customisation options"", ""I'm using it for my running practice. Writing this after using it for 2 months.* GPS initial connection takes some time. If you have a mobile and enable GPS on mobile it picks up signal faster.

I purchased this through the Amazon Singapore website, and it's certainly not as advertised. Why are we getting different products from same listing as in the US?? And Why are we getting older versions of product that are branded Nokia instead of Withings???"", ""Funzioni:Il Withings Steel HR è un smartwatch che offre un'ampia gamma di funzionalità per migliorare la tua vita quotidiana. Una delle caratteristiche principali è il monitoraggio dell'attività fisica, che include il conteggio dei passi, la distanza percorsa e il monitoraggio del sonno. Inoltre, integra un cardiofrequenzimetro che ti permette di monitorare il tuo battito cardiaco in tempo reale. Questo è particolarmente utile durante l'allenamento per assicurarsi di rimanere nella zona di frequenza cardiaca desiderata. Inoltre, è in grado di rilevare automaticamente diverse attività fisiche come camminata, corsa e nuoto.Il piccolo schermo rotondo integra la possibilità di ricevere e leggere notifiche in seguito ad una piccola vibrazione leggera. Tuttavia, potrebbe mancare alcune funzioni più avanzate come il GPS integrato e di uno schermo a colori grande, il che è una cosa positiva per chi ricerca un design classico ed elegante di un orologio analogico.Qualità Prezzo:Il Withings Steel HR offre un'eccellente qualità costruttiva con un design elegante e un cinturino in pelle o silicone di alta qualità. La combinazione di funzionalità di fitness e uno stile discreto lo rende un'opzione attraente per coloro che cercano un orologio che possa essere indossato in qualsiasi situazione. Considerando la sua qualità e le sue funzionalità, il prezzo è adeguato da nuovo, anche se ho comprato da amazon Seconda Mano per circa 80€.Durata della Batteria:Una delle caratteristiche più impressionanti del Withings Steel HR è la sua eccezionale durata della batteria. Può durare fino a 25 giorni con una singola carica, il che lo rende uno dei migliori in termini di autonomia. Questo è particolarmente utile per coloro che non vogliono preoccuparsi di ricaricare il loro smartwatch ogni pochi giorni. La combinazione di funzionalità e lunga durata della batteria è davvero notevole.Complessivo:Il Withings Steel HR è un'ottima scelta per coloro che cercano un equilibrio tra funzionalità di fitness e stile elegante. Offre un ampio set di funzionalità di monitoraggio dell'attività fisica e della salute, una qualità costruttiva solida e una durata della batteria eccezionale. Tuttavia, potrebbe non essere la scelta migliore per coloro che cercano funzionalità avanzate, schermi a colori, visibilità completa e dettagliata delle notifiche."", ""Je suis un peu déçu la vitre est fragile et est déjà rayé 😔 la synchronisation est pas top non plus surtout pour les nuits 😔 et l'application pourrais être mieux... Faire du sport crame ma batterie et le sport en salle bah j'ai pas trouvé dans l'appli"", 'È un mese che sono alle prese con questo dispositivo, dunque credo sia arrivato il momento per una recensione, anche perché quelle presenti sono vecchie e riguardano i dispositivi Nokia, non questi ultimi Withings.Ammetto di essermi spaventato leggendo le recensioni degli altri utenti, le quali però sono state scritte prima della passaggio da Nokia (che presentava molti più difetti) a Withings (il quale ha perfezionato questo dispositivo) come ho già detto.Anche il packaging mi ha fatto prendere un colpo, proprio perché era brand ""Nokia"" che non avrei voluto tenere.• PACKAGING: 8/10Raffinato, smart, comodo. Nient\'altro da aggiungere.• DESIGN : 6/10Adoro gli orologi analogici e questo ibrido fa proprio al caso mio. Sono abituato ad una cassa più grande dei 40mm ed è un peccato che non ci siano altre misure oltre questa e la 36mm. La corona numerata è una bella idea, così come la mancanza di numeri all\'interno che aumenta lo stile di questo orologio in combinazione con il quadrante scuro, un vero tocco di classe. La cassa poi è spessa, non troppo scomoda da tenere ma sicuramente per situazioni più specifiche come il vestirsi, dove l\'orologio tende ad impigliarsi. Il voto rispecchia proprio questi piccoli dettagli. Avrei messo sicuramente un vetro in zaffiro e non lo avrei fatto arrotondato in maniera così evidente, perché questo causa fastidiosi riflessi e non salva certo l\'orologio da impronte e sporco. Inoltre, lo stacco tra cassa e vetro curvo genera un qualcosa di fastidioso, uno spessore al quale possono rimanere impigliati fili o altre cose sottili: fortunatamente non è tagliente.• FUNZIONALITÀ : 8/10Le funzioni sono limitate, smart nel senso letterale del termine: essenziali, utili ma forse con qualche mancanza.Partiamo dalle notifiche, perfette e utili, tranne che per i messaggi esageratamente lunghi, come è normale che sia; è possibile attivarne per la maggior parte delle applicazioni, incluse WhatsApp, Instagram e Facebook, in modo da poter essere aggiornati senza dover tenere il telefono in mano continuamente e nei momenti meno opportuni.Piccola pecca sta nel momento in cui si ricevono più messaggi dallo stesso utente o gruppo: l\'orologio inizia a vibrare per ogni messaggio e diventa cruciale la scelta del silenziare i gruppi e/o disconnettere momentaneamente il dispositivo. Anche la disattivazione della notifica con un tap sul pulsante laterale non fa che ritardare la notifica che si ripresenterà dopo un paio di minuti, come se arrivasse nuovamente.Il monitoraggio dell\'attività funziona a singhiozzi, solo sotto uno sforzo corposo e per sfruttare al meglio questa feature bisogna per forza connettere il dispositivo e accenderne il gps perché il dispositivo non ne è munito... Un vero peccato.Ho acquistato questo orologio anche per risparmiare batteria sullo smartphone, grazie al bluetooth a basso consumo, ma essere forzato ad attivare il gps significa fare un passo indietro.Riguardo al numero di attività registrabili, ve ne sono parecchie grazie all\'ultimo aggiornamento che lo avvicina molto alla versione Sport, che a questo punto vince solo per la presenza del sensore VO².Per quanto concerne il monitoraggio del sonno, anche qui ci sono da fare delle obiezioni: spesso misura interruzioni completamente a caso e di grande minutaggio oppure interrompe la registrazione in anticipo o addirittura in ritardo, costringendomi a modificare manualmente (che significa senza parametri misurati) la durata del sonno, ma credo che sia colpa del mio muovermi parecchio durante il sonno; peccato che non registri il sonno negli orari più insoliti, ad esempio in caso di siesta pomeridiana, che per lui è un momento di stallo e non di sonno. Per quello che costa avrei fatto uno sforzo in più, almeno in questi piccoli dettagli.Credo che ci sia stato un aggiornamento riguardo la sveglia, che non rimane sempre la stessa, ma ha programmabili molteplici orari e sono tutti attivabili, mentre prima era attivabile una sola sveglia, che però poteva ripetersi per tutta la settimana. La vibrazione non è troppo forte e spesso non riesco a sentirla e sono costretto a impostarne una di sicurezza sul telefono, quindi per esperienza non fate affidamento al 100%Il monitoraggio passi non è completamente fedele, ma si tratta di una perdita minima. Stessa cosa per il misuratore di battiti per minuto (bpm) che a volte differisce dalla misurazione fatta con altri dispositivi; questa non è continua ma avviene ad intervalli di tempo, che però non ho misurato.Sarebbe graditissimo il controllo multimedia, ma forse chiedo troppo...• APPLICAZIONE : 10/10Una delle migliori applicazioni di fitness e controllo dispositivi, davvero ben fatta. Collegamento e sincronizzazione veloci, dati coerenti e possibilità di personalizzazione entro i canoni. In più parla (anche se con qualche difficoltà, dovuta però ad altri) con le altre applicazioni di monitoraggio. Complimenti a Withings.• CINTURINO : 7/10Preferisco il cinturino in cuoio, ma con quello di gomma riesco a tenerlo durante gli allenamenti o sotto la doccia, per via della sua impermeabilità. Ho imparato comunque a convivere 24/7 con l\'orologio, che prima ero solito togliere per andare a dormire o fare la doccia o sport. Spero che non mi farà ricredere quest\'estate.• BATTERIA : 10/10Anche qui niente da dire. In due mesi l\'ho ricaricato due volte ma senza farlo mai scendere al di sotto del 35%. Durata della batteria ottima, che ha un consumo medio del 3% giornaliero: un vero portento. Questa peculiarità mi ha aiutato anche nella scelta dello smartwatch o hybridwatch o fitnesswatch, chiamatelo come volete.In definitiva sono soddisfatto di questo acquisto, consigliato per chi vuole evitare di tirar fuori il telefono costantemente, pur rimanendo aggiornato tra messaggi e notifiche social, per chi ha bisogno di un orologio smart ma che sia analogico e per chi pratica sport e vuole monitorare la propria attività, senza cambiare fitnesswatch di dubbia affidabilità.', 'This is my fifth activity tracker, first Withings one.Overall after nearly a month I’m happy. App is good (nothing like the horror of the Decathlon app, lots of info and analysis and seems to have good partnering with other apps), I like that it is a watch not a band, battery life so far is superb (I’ve not had to charge it yet, my Garmins had awful battery life, nowhere near claimed), and it’s easy and intuitive to use. The hand showing how far you are to your walking target is nice and subtle and grown up.Minuses: no “move” alarm/prompt AFAICT, visibility of hands is sometimes hard as they are very fine and not illuminated, visibility of the digital display is poor in strong light (summer daylight) and too fine to read without glasses (that is me not them, but on my Garmins I could read them).It’s not perfect, but so far it’s pretty good, especially as I got a “return” for a bargain price.', 'Habituée aux produits polar que je ne portais que pour le running, j’ai acheté cette montre il y a deux ans et j’en suis ravie. Elle est élégante et parfaite pour un usage quotidien. Elle ne permet pas de programmer des sessions de fractionnés mais elle tient très bien la route pour le suivi de la FC. J’opterai pour la scanwatch par la suite. Autonomie de 30 jours', ""La meraviglia del withings è che sembra un orologio classico. (Ha le lancette 💕) Chiaramente lo schermo delle notifiche è limitato alla visualizzazione delle notifiche. Ma finalmente ho trovato un smartwatch che sia anche piacevole da indossare, non sovradimensionato per la mano di una donna, e non troppo sportivo.Consigliata da in amico, l'ho comprato usato, durante i prime days e pagato 70€. Lo schermo presentava uno striscio non grande, ma visibile... ma visto che ho le mani di polenta non mi sono preoccupata, infatti non era particolarmente diverso da quello che ho fatto dopo qualche giorno di utilizzo  😎(Ah, il lettore del battito cardiaco non dà fastidio)"", ""Tant de choses à dire sur cette montre !Tout d'abord, je voulais une montre à l'aspect classique mais avec des fonctions connectées. Après avoir prospecté les différents modèles de montre hybrides, je me suis tourné vers celle-ci qui correspondait le plus à les critères : avoir des aiguilles, une batterie qui tient plusieurs semaines, des notifications venant de lin smartphone pour ne plus louper des appels ou des messages et jn suivi du sport. Globalement j'en suis très satisfait : le suivi du sommeil est précis et permet de programmer des alarmes qui réveillent en douceur avec une petite vibration sur le poignet, bien plus agréable que les sonneries musiques ou autres réveils traditionnels et suffisant pour réveiller au moment le plus propice puisque la montre détecte à quel moment le réveil est le plus agréable. On peut bien évidemment donner une plage de temps pour nous réveiller ou juste une heure précise si on ne veut pas bénéficier de cette fonctionnalité.Pour les notifications c'est vraiment très pratique, étant constamment en silencieux car je n'aime ni la vibration ni la sonnerie d'un téléphone, ma montre me permet de me signaler discrètement (une petite vibration suivi d'un affichage sur l'écran) l'arrivée d'un appel, d'un SMS, ou tout autre notification configurable dans l'application fonctionnant avec toutes les applications du téléphone, avec un affichage qui permet d'en lire le contenu (ou en tout cas le début).Le suivi du sport est également très bon, la montre détecte toute seule une activité sportive et sait laquelle avec une précision qui m'impressionne : je suis toujours surpris en ouvrant l'application sur mon téléphone de voir que la montée a bien détecté mon heure de natation, de badminton, de danse ou de hockey. C'est magique ! On peut également déclencher facilement le suivi de sport en deux pressions pour suivre sur l'écran de la montre ou sur son téléphone en temps réel le temps, les battements du cœur, la vitesse pour certains sports, le nombre de mètres, etcL'application est très joli (contrairement à d'autres de concurrents qui sont plus austères et  pas très ergonomique), et très bien conçue. De plus on est encouragés, suivi et l'on peut exporter nos données pour son médecin traitant, pour son nutritionniste ou son coach ! Quelle excellente idée !En plus la montre reçois régulièrement des mises à jour pour ajouter des fonctionnalités très pertinentes. Il y a un vrai suivi du produit sur le long terme et c'est très bien.J'en aurai encore tellement à dire mais je vais finir en faisant deux petites critiques : d'abord le suivi de la fréquence cardiaque est parfois un peu hasardeuse et décroche suivant le position de la montre, un transpiration et je ne sais quel autre raison. En moyenne cela fonctionne très bien mais je suis parfois amusé et surpris de voir quelques secondes 50bpm lors d'une session de sport intense... Ensuite, ayant pris le modèle blanc qui me plaît plus, l'écran noir se voit un peu plus, les naïfs y voient un effet de style, les connaisseurs reconnaissent rapidement une montée connectée. Question de goût, personnellement ça ne me dérange pas plus que ça mais si la technologie permettait de rendre l'écran transparent ça serait exceptionnel.""]"

For perspective, I’m a middle aged average guy starting to try to fight the dad bod and get into better shape. I also like classic watches (square forms just don’t do it for me) so I was happy to find an affordable round one like this.I chose the green one for the nice soft silver watch body and replaced the band with a stitched leather one for a little more classy look for everyday wear. The green silicone band is comfortable and I’ll use that if I wear the watch in water, but for the rest of the time the leather really ups the look. Size isn’t too big, either (I have fairly thin wrists).The software is reliable so far after a few weeks and the app is well-featured. I don’t use most of the features, of course, so it’s more than enough.It’s definitely a fitness-focused watch with a few extras, not a full smart watch but adequate for average users like me who just want some basics to help me think about my activity level. It has lots of workout/activity choices, that’s for sure. I haven’t tried any sleep monitoring so can’t speak to that.For the rating I stopped at 4 stars just because while they make a big deal out of the insane battery life, I think you’d have to tweak settings a lot to get that much. Leaving the watch factory settings as is, I’m getting about 8 days. That’s still fantastic compared to the expensive full featured smart watches, so no complaints. Also the weather app loses connection often. I wouldn’t care about that but I actually like it more than I thought I would, so hoping they improve it with a software update.I like that the watch shows me texts when they come to my phone; it’s handier than I expected, helping me decide if I need to grab the phone to read more or reply.People have been complimenting the watch, which is always nice. Looks kinda matter after all, since it’s still an accessory.I definitely recommend the Amazfit brand now that I have this. It’s great as a watch with some nice added features at a great price, and if it’s your first smart watch, it can be helpful to get you more aware of your activity level and such, which can help add some motivation to put more effort into a healthier, more active lifestyle. Step counting alone has already made a difference for me.Happy so far!', ""Alright, so to start, the reason this watch is getting 4 stars is largely due to me ordering the Matcha Green one and me getting sent a black one of the same model.  However, due to me having waiting eagerly for the watch to arrive, I wasn't too keen on the idea of having to either ship this back or drive over to Kohl's to return it.  However, if anyone else is dead-set on a particular color, the label on the back of the box should say which one you got.  Probably the picture on the front too, but who knows?To start, pairing the watch with your phone is super simple.  The watch itself will ask you to scan a QR code to get the app and then to have you sync them together.  The app is a little goofy, but that might just be my bias as I had a hard time trying to nail down all the settings I wanted to activate.  Admittedly, it took me too long to figure out how to get the weather app going on it.The watch has various faces to choose from (immediate plus as opposed to my old watch) and purchase within the app in the event the freebies aren't to your liking.  It can check a variety of health things like your blood oxygen level, blood pressure, and the like and can show the weather (love this part).  The wrist band is really comfortable and easily switched out without tools in the event you want to change it up.  The display is super clear and responsive too.Overall, great watch so far."", 'Lo compre para mis entrenamientos de natación, es una buena opción al igual que otros relojes cuando haces entrenamiento sin brazadas no distingue la distancia, se puede establece objetivo de distancia, duración y metas de calorías,puedes establecer la distancia de la alberca, indica, indica las vueltas que das, ritmo de brazada, distancia promedio entre brazada, la frecuencia cardíaca se muestra durante el transcurso del día, y me agrado el monitoreo del sueño.', 'A mi esposa le encanto', ""I read the reviews prior to ordering the Amazfit....let's just say it's not worth the money or the hype. For a company that is trying to keep up with Samsung and Apple they have a long way to go. But for a entry level device it's definitely not worth the $110 purchase price. Blue tooth  connection fails through out day. Phone calls are low...other person can barely hear what is being said.The app store for the watch ( their version of wear for their watch) is minimalistic. Limited to exercises and tracking apps. Also, the watch faces are limited ....they give maybe 5 or 6 free then you have to buy any other more. Also, there collection is limited to what I saw was maybe not even 100. Samsung and Apple both give wearers access to more watch faces both free and for sale. The Amazfit watch faces look to childish and made more for children.Battery capacity is really good and watch is light weight and an individual doesn't get tired of wearing it.Would I recommend for others to buy?  No...can't say I would. I wore for almost a week and it stoped working, died and haven't been able to get it to work. So, i went back wearing Samsung Active 2.Disappointed all around....seems as product description is misleading to get people to purchase an in expensive smart watch to track health exercise."", ""Only reason I gave this wearable 4 stars vs 5 stars is because there is no way to respond to texts. There isn't even a canned message response pool.  Outside of that the screen is amazingly bright, crisp, and responsive. The fitness tracking is on par with what you will find with higher priced wearables from samsung or the like.  One thing that I do really appreciate is the weight of the device is sooo much lighter than other comparable watches. Having had both a samsung sport2 and apple watch I much pefer the feel of this watch on my wrist. The other great feature is the battery life. I know battery life and price/battery life are thier big selling points but this watch has some serious battery life."", ""Great for keeping a check on my pulse.  Interesting sleep tracker.

However now, a mere 5 months after buying it, my review won\'t be as positive.The watch no longer illuminates when I lift my wrist, like I have it set for, and when outside during the day, the screen\'s ""brightness"" is so low, I can barely make it out despite the fact I haven\'t changed anything in the settings of the watch (to clarify, this was never an issue before- I was always able to see the screen!).Lastly, 2 weeks ago I ran a 10K race, so it was a measured course, the watch however was .5 miles off, which is the world to a runner!Next time, I\'ll most likely save my money to buy a Garmin or Apple watch, knowing I can trust the quality!', ""This is only the second watch I've owned by Amazfit and will never buy it from anyone else.  Only second watch because the first one lasted soo long.  The previous one had a battery that would last nearly a month, this one is rated for 7 days but I have been getting almost 3x that.  Love the fact that I did not spend $800 for a watch that you have to charge every day and that would not even last one workout for me (I'm an ironman). The 3rd party watch face editors and all the included features make this watch perfect for anyone. No compatibility issues works perfectly, tracks my training, and looks good.  Hope this one lasts 5 years like the last one."", ""The Amazfit GTR2e is exactly what I was looking for in a smartwatch. It has solid and nice looking design, 80 + whatch faces and growing, an amazing 2 weeks + battery with regular use, or a full week with heavy usage (doing exercise with gps tracking, continuously heart rate monitoring, etc...) It monitors very accurately my sleep patterns, it measures the blood oxygenation, also the body temperature (not great because of the place it measures it) and it has a plethora of exercise modes to choose from. The only thing this version doesn't do is take phonecalls or listen to music directly from the watch. These functions are available on the regular GTR 2 for a premium if your in to that. The bands are 22mm universal fit and you can find a great variety of styles and colors on the internet. It's a great bang for the buck! I highly recommend it!""]"

I really wanted to love this smartwatch/fitness tracker. I don't have a lot of needs, but I need them all met, and based on the spec sheet and advertised featureset this should cover everything.What I liked about this device:- Long battery life- Lightweight- Gets all my app notifications- Fitness trackingWhat the marketing material doesn't say:- Setup is a nightmare. The device ships with a firmware version that needs to be plugged into a PC in order to be able to update itself to a firmware version that can update OTA; except Windows 10 doesn't recognize the device when plugged in and Fitbit doesn't have drivers available on their website. Then once you get the device updated, there's still a slew of connectivity issues getting the device to pair properly with your phone.- The app notifications are inconsistent at best. There aren't many apps I actually want notifications from, but the few I do want I need them consistently. Sometimes they come through and everything is great, and other times they don't come at all and the troubleshooting steps to fix them is to reinstall the Fitbit software, reconfigure the device (and all of its settings), and restart both my phone and the watch.Here's the kicker: these are problems occurring in the first 24 hours! I haven't even had the device for a full day yet and I'm having all these problems. My last smartwatch, an LG G Watch R, was made in 2014 and didn't have any of these problems. It's 2020 Fitbit, this level of inadequacy is unacceptable.This device is a sleek and stylish fitness tracker, and does those tasks well enough, but if that was all I wanted there are better devices (even better Fitbit devices) that do that job. I bought the Versa Lite because I needed app notifications, and having to reconfigure the device daily isn't going to work out for me.I'm giving this a few more days to see if things stabilize before I return it.---EDIT: I've owned this for a week. The setup process is a nightmare because it ships with a buggy version of the firmware, and there's no way to force or sideload the update. You just have to wait DAYS until the device finally decides to update. After the update, many of the problems went away.Coincidentally, I got myself a new phone about a day after I got the update and once I paired the FitBit to my new phone things that never worked on my old phone suddenly worked on the new one.Pre-update + old phone: 2/5 starsPost-update + old phone: 3/5 starsPost-update + new phone: 4/5 starsI'll be updating my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars because once it's fully updated it's everything I wanted from it, but the horrible out-of-the-box experience cannot be overlooked. Word of advice: if you do decide to buy this, aim to get it a week before you actually want to start using it!"", 'I\'ve been wearing the Lite for about three days and am still figuring it out.  I had to change to the large band (free with the tracker), I found it extremely easy to change the band.  What I don\'t like about the band (soft plastic) is it makes my wrist sweat, but not ready to put more money into this tracker until I\'m sure I\'m keeping it.  I LOVE the size of the screen, big clear display and even in daylight, outside I can easily read the screen.  There are a variety of watch faces you can choose from, but not all are free. The main reason I went with the Fitbit Versa Lite is for the heart monitor and sleep tracking.  I\'m still trying to figure out the heart monitor and how it works.  I\'ve read that it can take up to three days for it to adjust to your rate.  I haven\'t worn a watch in years so, for me, there is an adjustment of wearing something on my wrist almost all the time.  If you want to wear for sleep tracking you can easily have the watch screen stay black for certain hours so that it\'s not turning on and off all night long.As of right now I do like this tracker for the large easily visible screen, it is not cheap looking and the blue color looks much better in person.  I will update as I go along.I am not a tech savvy person, so it can be a little frustrating to set up the tracking.  The battery life will depend on what you use the tracker for, the more stuff you want it to do (games, etc.) the shorter battery life.  So far I am on day three and at 60% life.The charging cradle: this is the most annoying accessory.  The cord is attached to the bottom of the cradle not on the side.  When you want to charge and attach the tracker it flops over to the side because the cord is on the bottom, it does not sit flat - what were they thinking?  It also doesn\'t come with a wall plug for charging, only a USB connection.I\'m getting about 3 1/2 days on one charge.  As of June 16 I\'m getting about two days of battery life.  The ""always on"" for the screen that is to stay off until you ""flick your wrist"" to turn on appears to have a mind of it\'s own.  For me, I\'m always researching and watching YouTube videos to try and figure out how to do things - there are no instructions included with the tracker just a message to go to the Fitbit website.  Amazon won\'t allow me to respond to questions about the Lite even though I purchased direct from Amazon and not a third party seller - so frustrating.']"

Firstly, it doesn't start showing your progress after 10 minutes of continuous walking, which is common in other watches. Secondly, The received messages are not openable on the watch, and it acts as just giving you the notice.UPDATE 2023/04/21: I found the option to monitor your walk actively and start recording.

Also, sleep tracking is not as well defined as the previous app and blood oxygen cannot be programmed to optimize battery life (is either on or off)"", 'The Xiaomi Smartwatch works exactly like advertised.', ""Upgraded from a miband 3 to this. Only gripe so far is can't change to imperial.... That's kind of a big deal to me...🤷🏻\u200d♀️"", ""First of all, I have to warn that the high reviews are not for the same watch. It seems as though the  reviews are combined for different models.I am reviewing the Xiaomi Band 7 Pro Smartwatch with GPS(Global Version). Prior to this watch, I had the mi 6 (narrow screen) band and absolutely loved it since battery life was long and the band worked flawlessly. I also really like the Zepp Life app.On the Xiaomi Mi Smart band 7 pro, the size of the screen is larger which is one of the features that attracted me to it. The screen is very nice. However, as a basic watch, it does fine. As a smart band - not so much. For this watch, Xiaomi chose to use the Mi Fitness app instead of the Zepp Life app. The Mi Fitness app leaves much to be desired. Either the watch or the app needs a lot of work. Syncing takes much longer than with my mi6 even though I've enabled all the app privileges. If I don't sync everyday, it most often looses data from previous days - especially the steps walked  which is what I want to track all the time.My initial thought was to return the band but chose to give it time in case there was something that I may have been doing wrong or if there were updates that would correct the deficiencies.After a couple of months with no luck, I finally reached out to support. Response time was about a day each time. They ended up sending me a new watch. The battery on the new watch was improved and most of the data synced except for steps. Same as before, the steps will not sync previous days data.I have several Xiaomi products and have been an advocate and fan for a long time. This time, it has been a huge disappointment.Update Sept. 4, 2023 after having had the replacement watch for about 30 days. The second watch still doesn't sync steps walked the previous days. I also noticed that the PAI tracker doesn't work - ever. It worked great and I grew fond of using PAI to track my fitness goals on the Mi 6.Cutting my losses and just purchased a different watch that uses the Zepp Life app."", ""That's what I blooking for!! Very, very good item"", 'Mi impresionó pero yo esperaba algo más grande', ""I absolutely loved this watch, the display was big and bright. The watch itself was good looking and I could easily change the band. I didn't like the app it used because I could not change to the imperial system and I am not use to the metric system but I lived with because of how much I loved the watch. The tracking was precise, the battery was long lasting. I could swim with it and not worry about the screen display changing. The health monitoring was accurate. Then one day the watch notified me that it was overheating and shut off. There is no switch you can use to turn it back on. You have to plug the watch into the charger and that turns it on. Except my watch won't go back on. It's completely unresponsive and nothing suggested by other users works to turn it back on. Surprisingly, I wasn't the only person who this has happened to. This watch lasted only 5 months. Frankly the day it overheated, it wasn't even that hot out and the watch wasn't tracking my activity. So disappointed because I really liked this watch."", ""I'm in the US.  I got this watch to replace my Xiaomi Watch Color which could only be used with the Mi Fit app as long as the China region was selected.  The GPS could take upwards of 5 minutes to get a lock as a result.  And it couldn't use imperial units, only metric.  So I got this Mi Band 7 Pro hoping to fix those issues.  The GPS seems to be much better and gets a lock in seconds, but there are still NO IMPERIAL UNITS. If you live in the US, this is probably a deal breaker.  I read that using Zepp Life could fix the problem, but that is not true.  Also, the HR Monitor won't take live measurements unless you're in an exercise activity, unlike the Mi Watch Color.  I wouldn't recommend this watch to anyone, especially knowing that the price here is double what they pay for it in China.""]"
‎B0B2J4W5TT,"SAMSUNG Galaxy Watch 5 44mm Bluetooth Smartwatch w/Body, Health, Fitness and Sleep Tracker, Improved Battery, Sapphire Crystal Glass, Enhanced GPS Tracking, US Version, Gray",Smartwatches,S$259.00,https://www.amazon.sg/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Improved-Sapphire/dp/B0B2J4W5TT/ref=sr_1_74?qid=1695864488&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051%2Cp_72%3A6469119051%2Cp_36%3A10000-90000&rnid=6450031051&s=electronics&sr=1-74,https://www.amazon.sg/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Improved-Sapphire/product-reviews/B0B2J4W5TT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,4.6,"['Good deal at Prime Day sale for the 44mm! Since its on Google Os now can use to make payment via Google Pay though Samsung pay is the default and cannot be removed.', ""Everything I needed is all there.. Well my first smart watch.. I'm loving it..Reporting location with my mum via Samsung watch.. called her from my watch.. Hahaha"", 'I had a primary goal in mind when I began to watch shop, and this would not only be my first smart watch, but first watch in general.  I knew I wanted the basics of a watch, namely some addition to my style efforts, but getting back into fitness and living a healthy life; a tracker for all the things that may help gauge my progress.Therefore, from a watch perspective, and style perspective, this watch crushes.  It tells the time, and the highlight of this is the ability to change the watch face.  You can go old school long and short hand, or new school with a digital display and dozens of options in between.  The watch is slick, modern, and compliments any outfit.  In my opinion, it far surpasses some of the watches out there such as the Apple version which is thick, more square, and an obvious smart watch.  I love the Galaxy watch because it doesn\'t have any tell-tell signs of being a smart watch.I wasn\'t sure what to expect out of a smart watch since this was my first.  One of the most pleasant surprises is seeing the notifications pop up, without grabbing my phone.  I frequent sites with two-factor authentication and seeing those codes pop right up on my wrist has been a major time saver.  All in all, the immediate view of the time (basic watch functionality), notifications, and the basic customization and slick look drives this watch to be a great thing to own.That however is where the dissapointments begin.  As previsouly stated, I purchased this, largely, to be a fitness tracker.  I was extremely interested in the sleep tracking as my sleep is terrible, and I\'m trying to determine if I have sleep apnea (not from this alone).  I also wanted a live time tracker of my heart rate as well as a step counter.  I could have gone with cheaper options that do these things, such as the higher end fitbit, or even other smart watches on the market such as the fossil.  I watched dozens of reviews on all of them, and ultimately settled on this watch, as I figured it would have the greatest synergy between it and my Galaxy S21 phone.  I also figured that with it having a higher price point, that the tracking would be superior.  Prepare for disappointment.I don\'t know.  Perhaps the tracking is fine but you have to be within the realm of accurate to feel confident in the results.  For example, the sleep tracker is not tracking sleep.  If I go to bed at 9PM, lay there for an hour, then sleep from 10-5, but also lay in bed after waking; the watch counts this from laying down to getting up, 9PM to 6AM.  Night after night, I sleep with varying factors, some nights tossing and turning, but each morning, the watch gives me about the same result.  Knowing I\'m a poor sleeper, the deep sleep and REM time ratings simply can\'t be accurate.  My previous partner use a fitbit, not even the highest end model, and the sleep rating for her felt a lot more accurate, not counting the time she laid in bed, but rather the time she truly slept.It supposedly tracks blood-oxygen levels while you sleep.  One day it showed me at 89%, not healthy but perhaps believable.  Last night, it showed me at 55% which, I\'m fairly certain I would be dead at that rate.  I would think the watch may try to wake me if that was true.  It supposedly tracks body-weight but I knew that wasn\'t correct when it put me at 9% - I WISH!  The next day it put me at 14%.  Sadly, neither are true right now.The absolute most infuriating piece of this poor tracking is quite simply that it doesn\'t do it in live time.  If I want to track my steps through out the day, I have to be ""recording"" my walk.  It doesn\'t seem to capture my steps on an elliptical, although I can switch it to elliptical mode.  Keep in mind there are so many different modes, you may be switching them constantly throughout a workout.  The more annoying one in this situation is the heartrate monitor.  I wanted to be working out and glance at my watch to see this in live time.  Nope, you have to click on the heart rate, then run it to get your heart rate.  Then, again, every time you want an updated rate.Conclusion on fitness tracking; it sucks.  I check my sleep record in the morning for very rough, arguably not accurate report on how I slept.  If desperate, in the gym, wanting to know my heart rate, I can stop and run the reader and hope it\'s accurate.  Compared to the treadmill reader, it is not accurate.  All in, I would not recommend this for a fitness tracker.And that\'s really where you have to question if you need a smart watch.  I will keep this because it adds to my style, and I do love the notifications.  However, the navigation, even with this being the 5th iteration of the watch, leaves a lot to be desired.Swiping Right = Brings up notifications, but it\'s difficult to scroll to previous notificationsSwiping Left = Brings up available trackers such as the aforementioned step counter for various activities (but not things like the heart rate tracker even though those would be great here)Swiping Up = Brings up an apps menu, of which I have used none.  This is frustrating because it is pre-loaded with a dozen apps and you can\'t seem to remove ones you don\'t need.  And Finally,Swiping Down = Same as your phone - various indicators, silence functions, etc...If you have a galaxy phone like the S21 or later that doesn\'t have a physical button, you\'re likely used to swiping right to go back - this does not carry over to the watch, you must learn to use a home button again.  While you may want the heart rate counter, or step counter ready on the go, there appears to be zero way of activating those, other than the small buttons on the face that you can add, but only on some of the watch faces, most of which only hold a maximum of four widgets.  AND, one of those widgets is the battery indicator.  If you want to have a quick view of your remaining battery percentage, and you want to use another widget for the date, that only leaves 2 spots or less for the things you do want.  Considering this watch supposedly tracks quite a few things, you\'re limited at clicking into only two points of tracking.  AND, if you want to view more, you seem to have to go into your phone, change the watch face, and add those trackers, which will replace the other ones you may want to see.  Conclusion; it\'s pretty crappy if you want to track multiple items as you can\'t just switch to those trackers from the watch face.  They must be added in advance, or you have to pull out your phone and completely change how your watch is setup.  I believe you can potentially add them as ""Tiles"" which is accessed by scrolling the screen in a circular motion but try doing that when you\'re in the middle of a workout.While I\'ve decided to award this watch only 3 stars, it is nice enough to recommend it.  I\'m not sure if any of the other models would have been better.  Some folks complain about the battery life, but it charges so quickly, it\'s not a deal breaker for me.  It\'s a nice watch, still worth the price, but the moral of the story; don\'t trust the trackers, nor expect an easy going time dealing with them.I hope this review helps someone make their decision!', ""I never had need or interest in smart watches.  After dropping & repurchasing over 10 budget phones in a 2 yrs, & really wanting a flagship, I decided to try the Galaxy watch. It supports the most functionality for any smart watch I looked at. Paired to S21 ultra it has provided so much to my daily life.  The convenience of tapping the watch for most of my apps and the information it provides through Samsung health (only off for showers & charging) are totally worth 200$. I wasn't sure that I would gain much from the health app but I WAS WRONG! Tracking my activity and sleep patterns (so much more) over the last 4 weeks has helped tremendously. I have a neurological nervous system impairment that highly impacts my daily life. Poor or little sleep and stress are the biggest impacts and this watch has helped me make major improvements to both. There's a crap ton of little tweaks to make it unique to your  needs, go through the learning process and make adjustments as you go. Wearing it all the time was my biggest concern. It did take a couple of weeks to fully adjust to wearing it 24/7 but now at 4 weeks I feel naked without it.( I'm hyper sensitive to touch & feel) I didn't buy screen protector & don't feel the need. My pic shows a recent cut from doing yard and house work all while wearing my watch, it's pretty durable.  I highly recommend this watch over all! I wouldn't waste money on inferior watches that won't hold up or do all this can. With the latest tech & durability this smart watch should last a couple years at least 🥰"", 'I previously had the Fitbit Iconic and was bummed to let it go due the recall. I didn’t purchase a new watch right away because I wanted to look at my options. I’m not an Apple user and have been loyal to Samsung since I had to let go of my Windows phone, no comments please. I’ve received enough “feedback” from my friends. This summer I was really missing my Fitbit given I was walking a lot and wanted to track the steps. I looked at the previous version of the Samsung Galaxy watch and wasn’t a fan. After reading about the latest model I decided to pull the trigger. I love it and am really happy with the capabilities, from phone calls to health tracking. The phone calls are super clear and people cannot believe I’m talking with them via my watch. The UI is very easy to use. My only complaint is the health app doesn’t track stairs or elevation like the Fitbit Iconic does.', ""We have been really satisfied with this watch. It is the 1st smart watch anyone in the family has had so I'm not overly sure what critiques to have on it. Its been wonderful to be able to acess my phone features without needing to stop and take my phone out. I have been using the fitness features as well. It has been a month or two so I dont have any negative opinions as of yet. I mostly charge it when I am getting ready in the morning and that last me thru the day and evening. I'm still getting used to all the features and functions it can control. The mic isn't super clear when using the watch for calls but it's still good for hands free option of not digging in your pocket or purse to be able to have a quick convo."", ""I think this watch is worth the money. I have a Galaxy S22+ and love the compatibility. My intended use was overall fitness tracking and being able to see important messages without having my phone tempting me within arm's reach. The pedometer and sleep tracker appear accurate. This might not be a great option if you are someone who wants the watch to intermittently track your heart rate, it eats the battery. This isn't a deal-breaker for me. The 40 mm is perfect size for my smaller wrist. I have not tried some of the features such as Samsung Pay but imagine they would work seamlessly just like the other features. I even downloaded a game for when I don't have my phone connected to keep me busy when waiting for meetings to start."", 'I wish the band were a tad longer but I replaced it with generic straps that have the length that I want. I like the fitness tracker but I think the O2 monitor is not as accurate as my Wellue O2 Monitor. Snore detection is useless for me as you have to put your phone near you for that. The watch does not detect it on its own. Exercise detection is not always accurate either. I know I make my activity goals as it is 60 minutes a day and it rarely triggers that I met that goal. It does count steps well so not sure how it measures activity of steps but not activity. Body composition measurements seem ok, but I use an INBody scanner at my gym so I will check the accuracy at my next check up.', ""works perfectly and the only negative thing I wish the product could improve on is the battery life 😫 however, I knew upon purchasing the item that it doesn't have the best battery life after reading the reviews and researching about it so I can't complain much! if battery saver is on I can stretch it out to 2 whole days or 2.5 days, but I usually charge it the night or morning of so the battery depletion isn't a big concern 😌 everything else works fine, apps and such! customization is also quite easy so that was a nice touch compared to an old Fitbit I had 👌🏻"", ""Great smart watch.  I just traded up from my trusty Samsung Gear Fit 2 that died.  I'm happy with the updates, the new sleeker look.  It's not as tough as my previous watch.  I purchased an inexpensive cover with separate screen protector and am very happy.  The battery life is good.  Maybe not as good as the description, but I'm a heavy feature user.  I charge daily.  I'm not a small girl, but the watch band I got is s/m and it fits fine with a few holes left.""]"

I can definitely say that overall this is the best smartwatch I've used, and, yes, that even includes the Apple Watches.First of all, not even for one second am I going to invest in yet another Wear OS watch. I had a couple of Wear OS 1.0 watches, including one that was upgradeable to Wear OS 2.0, which basically rendered the watch unusable. I then upgraded to a Wear OS 2.0 watch only to have Google and the watch manufacturer just completely abandon the watch and the entire platform. Now Google has come out with Wear OS 3.0 as if they first two completely failed versions never existed, and want me to pay $300-500 for it??? No, thank you! So, I started looking at alternative watches like TicWatch, Garmin, Fitbit, etc., when I came across this AmazFit brand. I was immediately impressed with the features/price ratio. I had just about settled on the AmazFit GTS 4 Mini when I decided to go for the AmazFit GTS 4 instead.The AmazFit GTS 4 does everything and more that I want from a smartwatch. It has far more sports modes, better GPS system, vastly superior battery life, and more accurate bio sensors than any other watch out there I've tried. I've had Wear OS watches that allowed me to initiate as well as fully respond to SMS text messages, and frankly I found the whole process to be cumbersome and almost useless. This watch allows you to receive notifications of incoming texts, and even quick respond with pre-defined custom messages. You can also receive, dismiss, or even answer/talk phone calls. I can also receive (or not) notifications on my watch for every other app on my phone, control YouTube Music, Spotify, Amazon Music, and even download music to the watch and use bluetooth headphones/earbuds to listen to it without having my phone nearby. It monitors sleep very accurately, and all the bio sensors seem to be very accurate and reliable. Setting up and configuring the watch was much easier than setting up my Wear OS watches and getting them to work properly, and it was even easier than setting up my family member's Apple Watches.The AmazFit brand is also popular enough that you can get accessories for them, like charging docks, screen protectors/cases, watch bands, etc. -- everything that you can only get for like the Apple Watch, but can't get for the Wear OS watches because Android hardware is so fractured.So far the AmazFit GTS 4 has actually functioned flawlessly and I haven't encountered anything that didn't work or feel like I'm missing any feature(s). Simply put, it's just a great watch, especially if you're using an Android phone.One Week Update: I've now been using this watch for a full week and I still feel the same about it -- simply the best smartwatch I've encountered. In this week I've found even more watch faces and even found an online editor that allows me to create my own custom watch face. I'm running the same or similar faces to my family's Apple Watches, including Mickey and Minnie Mouse, etc.  My sleep monitoring has been spot on as has my heart BPM. I'm counting steps, miles, and time in multiple apps, and I can definitely say that the AmazFit GTS 4 is as accurate as all of them. It also has identical accuracy to my wife's Apple Watch.  The battery life has been superb. I walked all around Disney World for over 12 hours with the watch tracking my steps and heartbeat automatically, but also keeping track of my walking, as well as reading/answering texts, phone calls, etc. throughout the day, and the battery never went below 70%. At the end of the day my phone with its 5,000ah battery only had ~25% charge left. My previous Wear OS watches would've been dead after 6-8 hours of heavy use like that, and my wife's Apple Watch was at ~20% charge at the end of the day. Still absolutely loving this watch!"", 'O relógio entrega exatamente o que promete, tem bom acabamento, estou usando a 1 mês e está em perfeito estado, eh macio, leve, confortável para dormir, a função Alexa tenho usado poucas vezes.

Considering the cost its not worth it taking the risk of product without warranty.  at least  they should highlight that information before ordering and I feel cheated , as regular buyer in amazon & Samsung', ""I am having to change my review as after just swimming in the lake they died.Please note that before swimming I did even put it in swimming mode.Repair guys (official Samsung customer service) they said it's not feasible to repair as it would cost the same amount as the new watches."", 'I have had several smatch watches.  Casio smartwatch 6 years ago, 1 fitbit charge 4, 2 prior iterations of the Samsung Gear Watch, 1 prior was also the LTE version and this is the best so far.  Mine is the 45mm LTE version.Pros:  Very nice fit and finish, so glad they kept the rotating bezel, this is something that I could simply not live without in such a watch.  It is so slick and smooth.  I couldn\'t imagine having to swipe and tap constantly like on other phones.  If you only want to use it for step counting, weather apps, etc, then no problem.  However, scrolling through hundreds of spotify songs, playlists or other music files would be a real pain in the neck if it weren\'t for this handy feature.  Also, being able to adjust your brightness, volume and other controls using the bezel is SO much easier rather than having to tap to change for every single feature.  Trust me, try it, you won\'t go back!Battery life is surprising long given what this puppy can do.  I can get nearly 2 days for everyday app use. HOWEVER, if you are wanting to stream music on 4G LTE or make tons of calls, it will eat the battery much quicker...just saying.  However, it can fully charge from 20% battery life in about 45 to 50 minutes.  I come in from being out all day, lay it on the wireless docking/charging station and do some stuff at the desk and in <1 hour it is ready to go.The fit, finish and overall quality is outstanding.  It is a hefty and VERY solid piece of equipment.  Honestly feels like a Rolex on your wrist with regards to its solidity.  There is no hollow sound and I am amazed at how the engineers can cram so much tech into this house.  It does not feel like a block of wood or lump of stone and is very comfortable.  However, if you are used to a fitbit versa or charge 4, etc., that is a nearly ""barely there"" type of accessory on your wrist, well...there will be a different feeling, but it isn\'t cumbersome.The display is stunning.  Even in full sun, it is EASILY readable and is simply a gorgeous display.  There is no annoying pixelation.  I can generally keep it at 1/2 brightness and it is very bright and clear and my eyesight isn\'t the best (auto bright works very well also).OK, I have to say, I have never used Spotify, I am a youtube music fan myself, but youtube music isn\'t an app for this watch.  However, you can STREAM using wifi or the 4G LTE even when your phone is not around.  I don\'t think you understand how freaking cool this feature is.  Most fitbit or other smart watches have music apps where you tether to your phone via bluetooth and the watch is more of a remote control.  Or, you can download so many files which is also a pain.  Nope....I can wirelessly stream while I am on a walk or jog anything on spotify.  The easiest thing is to go online via your phone or laptop and setup your playlists.  You CAN also download these playlists if you don\'t want to stream.  I mean, WOW, slap in 2 wireless BT earbuds, turn your main phone off and go for a job or walk, listen to what you want.  If you didn\'t download the right playlist or haven\'t set one up, just scroll through the ones they already have for nearly every genre of music and go with it.The built-in speaker is surprisingly good, obvious if you are looking for Bang & Olufsen sound, good luck in ANY smart watch or phone.  However, it is relatively loud and would be obnoxious if at max volume with people around.The Samsung Health app is actually pretty good.  The step counter and distance measuring is MUCH more accurate than on my brand new fitbit charge 4.  I sent the charge 4 back, it would count 1000+ steps while I was driving due to wrist movement, drove me nuts.The single lead ECG (EKG), SpO2, stress meter, etc. is really good for the most part.  I personally think that Fitbit has the slickest app on the phone which gives you a clearer picture of your health.  But, Samsung Health works well for the most part.  The actual health monitors on the phone aren\'t buggy and I have had no difficulties getting it to take measurements consistently.On a side note...I was told this would take blood pressure.  Well, apparently the firmware if you live in Korea has this function.  I hope that it come soon, that would be honestly the bees knees to have this function.  This would TRULY give the Gear 3 an advantage over every other smart watch out there.  I mean good grief, ECG, O2 sats, blood pressure, heart rate.  Who would have EVER though this was possible on a watch even 5-10 years ago.Cons:OK, I am sorry to say, but they may have 1000+ apps for the watch, most are mediocre at best.  For such a dang good watch whose general type has been out for years (ie., frontier, gear, etc) you would think they could put out decent stuff.  They are so freaking limited with the Tizen chipset.  I wish they were more android based, I think samsung could sell a crap ton more of these puppies if they simply changed to android.They watch faces are cool and all but just a few google apps would be so dang handy.  Good luck trying to find a good assistant (Bixby is garbage for the most part), google maps or ANY good GPS app or music services such as youtube music or similar isn\'t available.Samsung could literally destroy the smart watch market if they had an android system that gave OFFICIAL youtube music, youtube (modify it for smart watch compatibility, etc), google maps, along with their existing tech.Phew! OK, that is my take on it.  The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is mainly due to the lack of good and honestly necessary apps.  A longer battery life say 2 to 3 days would be fantastic, but its current configuration isn\'t frustrating.  I don\'t feel battery anxiety like the apple watch (going off others\' experiences, not my own, never had one, sure that they are great watches too).  However, overall after wearing this out for the past several days streaming music (still probably one of my favorite features), making calls, sending texts and responding to emails, etc., it is just about as good as it gets for the $369 that it cost me.  Spring for the 2 to 3 year replacement plan too.  I mean good grief, it is only like 10% of your purchase price.  These are expensive and complex things to fix and one good smack against the wrong type of surface and well...scratched up paper weight.', ""Overall, the Galaxy 3 Classic watch is a great watch. I love the look which is very traditional and not cheap quality like the newer watches... very robust.  As long as you can live with some of the newest watch faces not being compatible you will be fine with this watch.I haven't had any technical issues and yes, I work in I.T. like another user, so I don't understand why they think it's so hard to use. It couldn't be easier. Want to reposition an app when you use the bezel? Start rotating the bezel, long press an app, then drag it left or right.  Want to customize a watch face? Use the wearable app on your phone. If it's an issue with a watch face, don't blame the watch. Email the developer of the watch face.I've used many of the features, including heart rate, O2 sensor, EEG, steps, etc and they all work great."", ""Notice: I am a software tech and understand how computer equipment works. Not everyone will have the same experience as me! I had read a lot of reviews about how they couldn't get it to work or connect to ATT. Yes, the Watch3 is fairly new and not everyone at ATT probably knows everything about it. But I hope that my review will help those people because I found that with ATT, a Samsung watch is different than any other smart watch.I like to try and do things myself rather than call someone to set up things like this watch. So I went to the ATT website and logged into my account. The first thing I was told by ATT when I was investigating the watch was that the watch DOES have it's own phone number. So I knew that I need to click on the link to Add A New Phone Number to my account. The next question was if I was going to purchase the equipment from ATT or bring my own. I selected to Bring My Own.Now here is where you have to be careful and fully read the instructions. Natural thinking would be to fill in the form that asks for the IMEI number of the watch and the SIM number. Problem is, you don't have a SIM number. If you read the instructions, for a Samsung watch, you need to purchase an eSIM activation number so you have to tell it that you are adding a Wearable and the click the link to get an eSIM Card and add it to your cart. Depending on the specials on that day, you could get it free or pay fees. Once you purchase this card, you will have to wait for it to arrive. Or you can be like me and call customer service and ask for the eSIM number right away.When I called ATT they saw that I had ordered and paid for the card and so they got the card number and with my IMEI number, they set up their system for the new cell phone number. You will not get an actual phone number because the watch will clone the cell phone number when you connect the two. The agent then texted a photo of the QR code for me to scan into the app when it asked for it. I printed the photo or you can email it to your desktop email to use it from the screen.Now you should have downloaded the Wearable app from the Samsung Store and started it. The app will turn on the Bluetooth and see the watch and connect it. It will then will ask you to scan the QR code or enter the activation code number. After doing that, I had to go to the menu option Mobile Plans and run the function to NumberSync your watch to the phone. Once you do this, your watch should be connected to the cellular network ONLY when it can not connect to your cell phone via bluetooth or via the same wifi network that they are both on at the same time.After that, everything worked right away. I had to answer permissions for every app that I started on the watch for the first time and sometime in the phone. It can be annoying but is a necessary evil. Understand that text will work when connect to the phone or not but email you can only read when it is connected to the phone. Same with a few of the health apps and other things. But overall, it has been great. If you have Samsung Pay on your phone, it will sync with the one on your watch.There are practically a thousand different watchfaces that your can get or purchase in the store for cheap. I found that the ones that you purchase work better and have more configuration than the free ones. There are Navigation apps and even Radar maps for the weather that work great.I even downloaded an app called Nearby Places that will tell me what businesses or government offices are near me. Just tap, select the category you are looking for and then search. Once you find what you want, double-tap and a map with the route will show up with options to get directions as well.For the most part, I can leave my phone at home for most of what I need to do if I don't need to worry about getting emails. But the biggest reason for purchasing this watch was because it has an SOS option where if I fall or if I click three times on the home button, it will text my neighbors and family as well as call 911 so that I can ask for emergency services. I have tested it with my son and hope to test it with 911 soon... once I know that the odds are accidentally triggering a false alarm is minimal."", 'Fuera de la degradación de la batería y que se vuelve un poco lento, su funcionamiento no va a decepcionar a nadie, yo lo uso para natación y la calidad de armado ha permitido que siga resitiendo hasta la fecha', 'Se lo regale a mi papá y le gusto mucho a pesar del color!', ""This Galaxy Smart Watch Three is Great. I love the heart*, sleep monitoring, also the SOS capability.It took about a 45 minutes on a Saturday with TMobile to set this up, and after it initialized, it now works as as standalone LTE/3G device operating on the same phone number as my primary Samsung Note 10 plus 5G. Many features work best while syncing in bluetooth range with my Smartphone. It is liberating to me to be able to leave my Smartphone home on occasion. I am enjoying streaming Sp*tify music service, free six month service for (new) Samsung customers. Moving music and photos to the watch is seamless. The sound quality on phone calls is loud and clear on the built-in speaker and you can bluetooth to headphones.I have about a 7 inch wrist and the 45 mm fits and looks great, not heavy or tiring. Opted for the silver (standard stainless shiny steel look) color, nice quality build, design, and look. The phone carrier has a buy one get one free and 24 month payments. I opted to buy direct from Amazon, and also their extended warranty plan (covers drops and damage, no deductible). I did get a screen protector and also a Sp*gen brand black case protector. and waiting on a black plastic strap (easier to wipe down and sanitize than leather strap). If you have WiFI and/or have your Smartphone handy, you may not need the LTE/3G connection, but I suggest ordering the LTE/4G model, it is about $50 more and you then have the option to toggle service on (or off). You may also need an additional charger, one for office and other from home. The capability to wirelessly power and charge from my Smartphone was not that great. Unclear if this Smartwatch works with non-Samsung phones. Happy with my purchase and Amazon. If you are on the fence, don't hesitate, get ticking ... and get the Samsung Galaxy Three, as time awaits for no one.Update: Not using this watch as much as in the past two months of ownership. Price has dropped quite a bit 10/2020. It has its quirks and generally I find it not as reliable as I imagined. * The heart rate measurement on the watch measures your heart beat, even when you are Not wearing the watch. Hope Samsung fixes this problem, as the measurement are skewing my stats and averages on heart measure, making this feature nearly worthless.  I probably would not buy it again if I had to do it over. It is still nice, but....just saying."", 'I\'ve had the Galaxy 3 for a few weeks now and recommend it highly.  I\'ve had eight Fitbits in the past ten years and when my latest started having charging issues - again - I decided to switch brands.  The Galaxy was recommended by family and after exhaustive research and reading hundreds of reviews, I chose the 3.  While the 4 is now on the market and the 5 is being designed, I didn\'t want to spend a lot to just track my steps, heart rate and sleep.  The 3 from Amazon was priced right.  It arrived in two days - as usual with Prime.  After about 90 minutes of initial charging, the watch has been everything I need and more.  A word of caution if you live in a cold climate - take the watch out, set it under a desk lamp and let it warm to room temperature before charging.  I\'m 67, retired and walk two to three miles twice a day for fitness.  The bells and whistles of today\'s smart watches are all there, though I chose a cool watch face (thousands to choose from) that tracks steps, heart and battery life - with a large traditional analog dial that is easy to see.  I was especially pleased with the automatic start, pause and stop feature when I start walking.  The Samsung Health App is especially useful, informative and very easy to navigate.  I really like the sleep tracking - better than Fitbit and with much more information that makes sense.  As to the battery - many reviews of this watch and nearly all smart watches complain about the battery needing charged often.  I charge mine for about 30 minutes each night before bed - while watching a ball game.  It starts at about 75% and is 100% when I go to sleep.  If you choose ""always on"" and activate every notification and every sound - you\'ll need to charge ANY watch twice a day.  This Samsung Galaxy 3 is more than expected.  You won\'t be sorry.', ""Initial review, got it yesterday.  Setup was quick and relatively painless.  Having attempted to buy cheap smartwatches before, the GW3 is far more intuitive, responsive, functional, and looks good.  I got the bronze one because that's the same as my Note 20 Ultra, although I tend to go with grays and blacks on watches in the past (way back before smartphones were so ubiquitous).  I'm a bit bummed that the phone can't do Blood-pressure monitoring here in the US (there are ways around that I'm told but I don't feel like sideloading stuff), so I guess I'll wait to see how that goes (Samsung, please get hot on this, we all want it).Much to my surprise, the watch will even play a YouTube video (although navigating the YouTube page is... problematic).  Yeah, I have to squint to see the video but it works.  I like the integration with my phone; once I sorted out what apps to download onto it.  The built-in watch faces are plenty good, although one could grab some off of the Samsung App store if they so desired.  One can order apps on just the phone but I found it's far easier to do so on the dedicated Wearables app on my phone.  Battery life is decent enough, I anticipate charging it in the evening before bedtime so I can track sleep time properly.Bewarned, it needed a software update right out of the box, that took about 20 minutes to get through but as I needed to initially charge the watch up already, it wasn't like I was missing out on wearing it.I'll update this in a few months, see how it wears on me after more time, but I'm liking it so far.""]"

As I progressed, I found myself wanting to listen to music while exercising without my phone flapping around in my pocket. After researching watches that could play music to Bluetooth headphones without my phone, I landed here.I haven\'t used a ""smart watch"" before, but my wife has, so while my experience is second hand, I can say I\'m fairly pleased.First off, the most important thing it seems to most people: The battery.I decided to break it and see what I could really expect.  There are only two things I tweaked: 1) Turned off the ""Always on watch face"" as I didn\'t feel the need to have a watch face displayed if I wasn\'t looking at it, and 2) I scheduled the ""turn face on when I lift my wrist"" to be off from midnight to six am. I didn\'t think it necessary for my watch to turn on while I toss and turn. I had all of the heart-rate, sleep, etc. all turned on all the time. I used the watch to listen to music through my headphones for 4 different runs, and a little around the house. So I would say other than the ""always on"" I gave it quite a push. After 7 full days, my watch battery was still at 15%. My wife is using a Versa 3 and for the same time frame she was at 10%-minus the music playing, and she doesn\'t have constant monitoring turned on. Battery life is great.  It\'s pretty responsive to swiping, but some of the integration in regards to the app are spotty. I\'m on Verizon and none of my message alerts come through as I\'m using the Message+ and the app only send notifications if I\'m using the base SMS in Android. That\'s kind of a bummer. There\'s a decent amount of watch faces(30 or so) and you can find one you like.  Getting music onto the watch isn\'t really straight forward. You have to use the app, which wants you to connect to the watch via wifi, but the watch has a unique wifi password that isn\'t in the manual, and really not easy to find within the app itself. I had to cause it to ""error out"" trying to connect about 5x before it showed me the wifi password for the watch.  I\'ve not taken it into the lake yet for paddle boarding, I\'m waiting for my protective covers to get here. It has knocked up against a few things(stucco, door jams, fiddling around under the hood of my car) and not been scraped or scuffed so far. Protectors, replacement bands, and even charging stands are cheap and plentiful on Amazon, so dressing it up a bit won\'t be an issue.  This again is my first experience, and maybe all smart watch apps are lacking in one way or another. My reports on sleeping and heart rate activity are all present and accessible, but not much to really dig deeper. For $130, I\'m very pleased.', 'Buen reloj , lo único es que la pila no dura 14 días , 8 días en uso normal si dura sin problema', 'I have 3 of the amazfit watch models (the Bip U, the Band 5, and the GTS 2), when they eventually integrate being able to respond back to text they will corner the marker with quality inexpensive watches that can do everything.My daily driver for 3-4 years has been the original GTS 2. I love it, having GPS on the watch was well as local music storage is great to have (similar to the Apple Watch).  I liked the circular style of the GTR2 and the increased screen size. Virtually identical to my favorite GTS2 in every other way.Imagine to my surprise after uploading some music to the watch, barely being able to hear the music at all. The speaker is on the BOTTOM side of the watch, barely on the actual side. I have thin wrist, wearing in on my left wrist. The speaker is on the left side, the mic is on the right side near the buttons. Because of the natural bend of anyones wrist, one, if not both will get covered depending on your wear style.If music or speakerphone use is a big deal, please do not purchase. Not sure if the newer versions have fixed this, not sure why this 2022 ‘updated’ version didn’t move the speaker grill, but this single-handedly has gotten me to return this watch.Side note: my GTS2 has the speaker and mic grills closer to the top of the watch face versus the bottom like this one. No complaints or usage issues.Like I said, I liked the look and size of this one but for what I use the watch for not having the speaker in a decent spot without having to bend my wrist funny or lift the watch away from my skin is not worth it. Buyer Beware.', ""Pros:First of all, the Amazfit product provides great utility watches for the price.  I remain loyal to their product.  I even order a second watch for my wife.  My first watch was Amazfit Bip U Pro because it had the sports tracking and GPS for less than $60.  I was pleasantly suppressed that not only did both functions worked well, but that the sleep tracking was super helpful in keeping me on track with my sleep hours.  I'm a teacher and coach, so getting enough sleep hours makes me a more effective communicator.  Full stars to Amazfit for this entry level watch that functions above and beyond other watches that have comparable functionality.  And it does it with an average of 5-7 days battery life.  We wish I could say the same for my upgrade purchase of the GTR2 2022 version.Cons: As I am incorporating the smartwatch functions into my daily living, I've decided to make an upgrade purchase to bluetooth uploaded music directly to my earphones as well as answering my bluetooth phone calls.  According to the description for my Amazfit GTR 2 (2022 upgraded version) I should be able to do both. Unfortunately, I was only able to get the uploaded music and direct bluetooth music listening to work.  The accept incoming calls and call notifications functions are not usable on my ios phone.

So what do I think of it? Honestly, I really like this watch coming from a FitBit Charge 3. Google\'s Wear OS makes so much sense and Google Fit is leaps and bounds better than any FitBit program with the way it integrates into my ""Lose It!"" app. That being said, the battery might be a deal-breaker for some. I typically have to charge my watch at least once a day, which is why I have a beside charging stand, a charger at work, a travel charger, and will probably be buying another soon to keep in my car just in case. The charger\'s aren\'t necessarily super easy to find, but they are inexpensive at least. a WARNING though: Fossil\'s Customer Service is an absolute nightmare to deal with and will only replace your product, god forbid it\'s defective, if you purchase directly from them as opposed to Amazon. I\'ve upgraded my review from a 1 to 4-star. I think you\'ll like this watch a lot, especially if the new Gen 6 model is pricier. Just keep what I\'ve said here in mind and remember that if your product is buggy your only saving grace is the mercy and pity of an Amazon customer service rep thousands of miles away.I\'m typically not one to leave bad reviews, or even pay much attention to them on Amazon, but I feel a need to warn buyers of this product and possibly any other expensive electronic purchases from Amazon. I was so excited when I purchased my Fossil Watch on Prime Day this year! It was normally a $250 watch, but I scored it for $145. On paper, it was exactly what was looking for: multiple faces, interchangeable bands, a sporty or  fashionable look, Google ios, and built for exercise. When my watch arrived on June 27, 2021 and for several weeks I was so happy about this purchase, often calling it one of my better shopping decisions. My only complaint was that the battery could drain very fast and it needed to be charged about every day, although it charged quickly. I tried my best to take care of it as well, carefully using a damp cloth to clean it after exercise and giving it time to dry. Overall it was so much more useful, accurate, and easier to care for than my fitbit. This all changed 31 days later on July 28, 2021. That evening after a night out and running low on batter I decided to charge the watch overnight instead of wearing it to track my sleep like usual. After I plugged it into its Fossil charger though I was startled by a constant vibrating sound from the watch. I turned to see the following message (see attached) ""Corrupt device. May not work properly."" My watch was stuck in a boot-up loop and couldn\'t charge or escape form this error message. After searching Redditt the following day for reports of similar problems I concluded there was no fix and engaged my Fossil warranty, hoping that my watch would either be fixed or replaced. I mailed my watch to Dallas and hoped for the best. Unfortunately, a week later informed via an email from Fossil Repair Services that not only was my unit not repairable (No diagnosis or reasoning was provided), but I would not be provided with a replacement product. Instead, Fossil\'s solution was to provide me a voucher valued at the Prime Day sale price of the watch for $145. Keep in mind while the value of watch is constantly shifting on Amazon\'s website, it\'s suggested retail value is $249, a $100 difference from the offered voucher. The voucher wouldn\'t even help me if the watch went on sale again on Amazon\'s website, because it was only usable for purchases directly from Fossil. When I later followed up with Amazon customer service to see what my options were I was told that because I had passed the 30-day return window my only solution was to activate my fossil warranty. Once again, keep in mind that my unit stopped working 31 days after delivery and that if you buy a refurbished electronic product from Amazon you will receive a 90-day return window. I have since had two more conversations with Fossil and Amazon and have additionally learned that Fossil will only supply a replacement product if you purchase directly from them. I can\'t express how disappointed I am by this episode. While I\'ll continue to purchase small cheap orders or possibly electronics accessories, I can\'t advise ordering consumer electronics from Amazon ever again. Also note, I purchased a $7.00 Progressive electronics policy with this watch, but it too will only cover my watch up to the sale price of $145, roughly $100 short of what it would cost to replace the watch.', 'Battery life is ok. Can be a bit slow but usable.', 'Battery backup max 12 hours with minimum use', 'It is linked phone via Wear OS, unlike 6th Gen. But is Good as it comes from Fossil. Best thing is you can install many apps directly on watch!', 'Watch is replacing my first generation fossill watch.  Like the round shape better that the square face and does what I need in a smart watch.', ""If you set it up right, this watch is awesome. I charge mine every night because I take it off at night. It hasn't let me down once. Upgraded the band. SUPER DURABLE. I MEAN SUPER DURABLE."", 'Very good watch by fossil …little bit costly but it also lets you reply on messages from the watch itself like Apple Watches…nice quality', ""Was really apprehensive about the purchase seeing all those negative reviews. Almost cancelled the order but then decided to give a try trusting the Amazon's return policy. Well, after few days extensive usage, I can say that the product doesn't deserve the harsh treatment it is receiving through the reviews. First thing one need to consider is that this is not a fitness tracker disguised as a smart watch, but a Wear OS based smart watch.  So don't compare this watch with the 'bolts' and 'noises' . It's true the battery backup is not a positive thing to say about this watch, but it is not as bad as depicted in some reviews. With wifi off, connected to the phone via bluetooth and using the default watch face, I was able to retain 35% charge after a complete days usage. When you turn WiFi on, it does drain the battery faster. I have the heart rate monitor turned on, Google fit connected and no other 3rd party app installed other than Spotify. When the device bluetooth is turned off, you can extend the device battery range to a few more hours. My point is, if you are experiencing battery drainage, it has to do with the connection and the watch face. If you are going for some funky faces, obviously battery range is going to suffer. Other than the battery issue, most people were happy with the trackers and other functionalities and same applies for me too. So, would I recommend this ? Yes and no. Yes- if you have budget constraints, No- if you can spend a few more thousands and go for Galaxy Watch"", 'I\'ve had this watch (Gen 5e with leather band) for two weeks now, and after playing around with it and doing one factory reset, I\'m pleased with the battery life and functions.The watch body is very substantial, with a polished nickel finish and ridges around the watch face. There is one button on the right, and the watch body comes out on either side to protect it from being bumped. The back is a textured plastic that feels very solid. It is not a lightweight watch, to be sure. But I\'ve gotten used to the heft, even after not wearing a watch since I was a teenager. The band is genuine leather on the outside with a silicone back. I\'m hoping it forms to my wrist more with a little wear, but it\'s comfortable, and it has never snagged on any hairs.The first few days, I was playing with features more, and added some apps. I wasn\'t familiar with the watch face customizations, so I put some non-stock watch-face apps on it. I put Messages, Outlook, and the Roku remote apps on it. And I enabled developer options (which seems to have had a negative impact on battery life).My goal for a smart watch was really just the notifications so I don\'t miss meetings, emails, texts, etc, if I\'m away from my phone. After a little more than a week, and having battery life issues, I did a factory reset and paired it again with my phone, knowing what I wanted to use this time.I did not opt for any of the fitness tracking features (heart rate sensor, basically). I think it still runs, but no apps are using it. I uninstalled everything on the stock setup that was allowed (Facer and Spotify and a few others). I never enabled the permissions for sensors, so no apps should be using those. The only thing I added was Messages so I could respond to texts without getting my phone out.Since doing this a couple days ago, my battery life is way up. At the moment, I\'m 9 hours since unplugging it, and it is at 70% battery with the default power settings (""Daily Battery Mode""). I haven\'t answered calls or used the speech-to-text, but unless you are doing that a lot, the battery is plenty for all day. Before doing the reset (with developer mode enabled, which I think was the culprit), it was down to about 30% after 8-9 hours.In summary, for my use case (notifications, calendar, time) it works great. I got it on sale, so it was even more worthwhile. It looks nice, and the interface is fairly responsive. Text on the screen is sharp and readable. I wish it were a bit lighter, but overall very pleased.']"

I'll come back in a month and share my experience with it then.It looks fantastic, sleek and thin. It's a beautiful expression of technology and styling.It does everything I need it to do, and it does it well. I'm running the cardio monitor to detect a-fib, so the battery life is pretty short. It's a small price to pay for a good cardiac monitor. If I have to charge it every day, it's all good.I love the screen, and the fact that I can read and respond to text messages and email by voice,very cool.The only complaint I could possibly have, is the battery life, it's very short. I probably need to turn off some of apps I have running. Other than that, I'm loving the new watch. It is very cool!EDIT : after the watch did all the updates, the battery life improved dramatically. I easily get two days of use per charge. It charges very quickly (in about an hour) and I am very pleased with my decision to purchase a Google pixle watch!"", 'When you first look at the reviews you see the very negative and unfair review by amazon reviewer ""James"".And I feel like if you\'re looking to buy this watch for the first time, his review will give you hesitation..I am here to counter his points and try to give this watch the praise it deserves for being Google\'s first wearable..While it\'s understandable that he has encountered some frustrations with the device, let\'s try to find some positive aspects to counter those negative points: Despite the battery life not lasting a full day, it shows that the device is power-efficient, as it can operate for a significant portion of the day even with regular use. I get a full day and a half and that is with the always on display which sucks power like crazy.. For me battery life has been great and better than the Galaxy Watch Actives I used to own.He isn\'t wrong about the over active calorie tracking..But while it may overestimate the number of calories burned, it shows that the device is sensitive to even the slightest movement, which can be motivating for individuals looking to increase their physical activity levels.It diligently monitors your physical activity and provides detailed information, including calorie tracking. While the accuracy might be subjective, the device\'s sensitivity to movement motivates users to achieve their health goals. Sure, it might overestimate the calories burned, but it keeps me motivated and aware of my activity levels. I mean, who doesn\'t want a little extra encouragement?Versatile Multi-functionality:This smartwatch is probably the most *smartest* one out there. Multitasking abilities are so impressive, it could give a plate spinner a run for their money. It\'s like a one-person circus, juggling notifications, apps with ease.With an array of features, this device transcends the boundaries of a regular smartwatch. It seamlessly integrates with various apps, providing convenience and accessibility to essential functions right on your wrist. It truly simplifies your digital life. It\'s not just a basic fitness tracker, oh no. It\'s a true multitasker that seamlessly integrates with various apps, making my life so much easier. I can receive and respond to messages and emails right from my wrist, ensuring I never miss an important notification.Seamless Connectivity: Having messaging and email apps on the device is a game-changer. It enables quick access to important notifications, ensuring you never miss an urgent message. While it may not be ideal for writing lengthy emails, it serves as a convenient tool for staying connected on the go.User Interface:The presence of buttons and a dial on the device can be advantageous for individuals who prefer tactile input or quick access to certain functions. These physical actuators can offer an alternative navigation method, especially for those who find touchscreen scrolling less comfortable.Stylish and Elegant DesignWith its stylish round screen, this smartwatch is the fashionista of the tech world. It\'s the Audrey Hepburn of wearables, effortlessly blending elegance and functionality.The round screen adds a touch of elegance and sophistication, making it a real fashion statement. I\'ve received so many compliments on its stylish look. Watch Apple in 1-2 years reveal a round design Apple watch and claim they reinvented the watch game and everyone praises them. *sigh*Google Wallet Function: Undoubtedly the best feature in this watch is the Google Wallet. It\'s a game-changer for seamless payments. I never thought I\'d enjoy a payment feature this much, but it\'s so convenient and efficient. Plus, it gives me an excuse to ditch my bulky wallet. Makes paying for things so convenient, it\'s like having a genie grant your shopping wishes. Just be careful not to rub the smartwatch too vigorously, or it might start granting other wishes!While the top review highlighted several negative aspects of the smartwatch, it\'s important to consider a balanced perspective before making a purchase decision. Every individual has different needs and preferences, so it\'s essential to thoroughly evaluate the features and drawbacks. Remember to read multiple reviews, explore different options, and prioritize what matters most to you. Don\'t solely rely on one review, but rather gather a range of opinions to make an informed choice that aligns with your specific requirements. Happy shopping!', 'So it\'s great with the Fitbit integration although after 6 months or something that\'s another subscription.Functionality once you figure it out is great, I\'m finally on a cell phone/watch system without bloatware which is great. But 44 mm compared to 41 mm doesn\'t sound like much on paper. But when you put it on your wrist. Wow it looks like a female\'s watch and that\'s not to be sexist. I\'m just saying it looks small.Also the battery life. I\'ve been wearing smart watches since the Galaxy active 2. So I\'m kind of used to this, what you have to do is find a time of day, usually right after work when you take a hour, long break or whatever (they charge fast), and just charge it while you\'re sitting on the couch. Or when you\'re relaxing of some type. And then you get it back gone and it seems to last 24 hours. If you need to read top up right before bed, that\'s a good time to do it as well. I really like to use the sleep detection functions so I always make sure I sleep with it on.It\'s a great watch. I just wish I went with the 45 mm instead of the 41. I think they make 45s. I\'m not sure.But other than that it works pretty flawlessly with everything on your phone the app. And yeah.You can get non-pixel faces. I do use one. I haven\'t figured out the complication (external data) part i would love to see my sleep right on the face. I use the ""minimal analog"" face and ya its done me well so far.I also find the step counter to be much more accurate than the Samsung.', ""Some quick thoughts:*Yes, I wear gloves every day 😁So the watch is generally pretty sweet. Possibly it's best feature is Fitbit along with text & calls.I also love that I can control my Pixel 7 camera with the watch & take selfies from 10 feet (3.048 m) away.The only major downside is the battery life. If you just got one, the first week is the worst. After that you'll have stuff figured out & will use your phone for many things. I charge my watch while I shower at night (so I can get the sleep data from wearing it overnight) & I charge it up to 100% while I eat breakfast & decrease the blood in my caffeine system.... This keeps it above 50% charge nearly all the time.Quick highlights: Sleek & light weight, I love Fitbit! Easy to use yet complex enough to still pick up new hacks months later. Battery could definitely be better.4 of 5 stars. Bring on the Pixel Watch 2 ⌚"", ""Looks great, nice customization options on the face, heart rate is consistent with my Fitbit Charge 5 which I had for a year and compared to Doc readings during visits and found to be very accurate.  Battery life is about a day and a half, but that's without putting it in battery saver.  So far really like this watch."", 'its a great watch, but my only complaint is its stuck with fitbit and the battery will only last 24 hours(if you dont use it for anything as a stand alone device) but its still a great watch and id prob buy it again haha.', 'I was unsure if I wanted to upgrade from a Fitbit versa 2 when it died.  So far very happy with this product.  Still learning all the features.  Voice quality on calls has been good on both sending/receiving.', ""I will avoid the facts that this watch is outdated at launch by its hardware (processor). That, coupled with retail and even discounted price also are out of step with the competition. These two big gripes aside. The watch is good and likely the best choice going into 2023 for pure Android Wear OS users (not looking at Apple or Tizen overlay users.)Its not perfect and Pixel users will benefit the most when paired to this watch. Its lost most of the lag recent watches from other Wear OS brands. Has all the sensors the majority of buyers could want based on watch tech right now. It swipes, it plays well with the apps made for it. It gives you the info you ask of it. There are even a few nice 3rd part accessories now to avoid Google Gouging for proprietary bands. And there are few quirks I hope they iron out soon. Mainly, when the phone is in Bedtime Mode. Make the watch do it too, or add that Zen Mode feature to the watch also. It sucks to have animals tripping the security cameras outside dinging on my wrist and killing my sleep score. The snooze/do not disturb button on watch fails too easily and you have turn it on/off manually everytime.As many claim, the battery sucks. Sort of. I can go up to 36+ hours on a slow day, and many others can too. It will depend on too many factors to list. But basically your popularity with notifications and thinking you need the screen always on are the biggest battery hurdles. Most can get use to touch to wake. And maybe only having text, phone, front door doorbell and one email be allowed to bother your watch with notifications. Do you really need to know what cousin Billy had at Dairy Queen when he posts the same pic/vid on Facebook, Instagram, Tic Toc and YouTube, etc. Find a nice balance of wrist information along with what sensors you need checking if you are still alive. You can start the day and track everything till the next morning when you charge it again while you shower and get the next day started. It charges quickly. And most other Wear OS watches have the same daily charge requirements. Nobody on Wear OS is winning on battery. Or Turn every setting all the way up and have a spare charger puck ready for a mid day juice. If you go that route. I suggest a quick release band to ease the removal of the watch.So, its not up to the level or price of the Ultra Apple Watch. And if you don't care for Samsung. Your love for stock Android will eventually lead you back to this watch. Unless you forgo ECG sensors. The price will drop soon. Cases are minimizing the fragility of an ALL glass jelly bean design. But when comes to keeping your phone pocketed and yet still have info relayed in a useful way. Pixel Watch is the best current albeit not perfect solution for now."", ""Really nice and great that it is a fitbit watch. The battery life is not very good but it lasts almost 2 days if you aren't running workout tracking, heart rate runs all the time and you can't turn it off so that kind the battery vs others that only read heart rate on demand. But it lasts a full long day no problem, just have to charge it every night."", 'I am frankly stunned by how awful this thing is.For starters the battery life doesn\'t even last a day. You can have this thing at full charge when you wake up in the morning, not turn on the screen once, and it\'ll go down to sub-40 percent by the time you go to bed.Further, it is absolutely worthless as a fitness tracker. As I am writing this, it is currently 4am, right. I have been doing nothing but sitting at my computer and typing away for the past four hours and this thing thinks I have burn 870 calories in that time. I am not kidding. Like, listen, I am definitely overweight- but I\'m not THAT overweight.And, good god, the bloated design. All I wanted was a digital watch that tracks my physical activity and gives me phone notifications. But Google thought it would be a good idea to have this thing do and be everything just sort of being a combination chainsaw clothes iron. It is so horrifically over-engineered that it does everything it does in as inefficient a way as possible. Want to check your resting heart rate? Too bad. You\'ve got to open a subsection of an app completely independent from the watch\'s operating system, and that app shows you absolutely everything except what you want to see. Instead of just giving you a simple two digit number, they give you a range, a microscopic graph and a bunch of factoids you didn\'t ask for.And right at the bottom, there\'s a prompt to open the corresponding app on your phone for more info- namingly the info you actually want. Everything conceivable facet of this device is like that.This thing is so overburdened with useless garbage. This thing has text message and email app for god\'s sake. Like, no, idiot, I am not going to type out an entire email on a touchscreen the size of my thumb. This thing is supposed to be a watch- not replacement for my phone that doesn\'t function without a phone.And the interface! One egregious oversight this thing has is that it has two buttons and a dial, but you can only change what the double tap does on only one of buttons. Everything else is 100% fixed. The other button is a ""Recent apps list"" which is the dumbest thing, because *it\'s a watch*! It shouldn\'t have ""apps"" to begin with! How much garbage could you possibly load onto this thing that that becomes a necessity? The dial/crown is totally pointless because it only serves as a scroll wheel on a device that lets you scroll with the touchscreen. Why even have that? There are four physical actuators on this thing, when it should really have one of them. And that is completely glossing over the fact that this thing\'s operating system glitches out so often than most of your button presses don\'t register. If you want to go back to your home screen, you have to press the button at least a minimum of three times for the thing to realize it shouldn\'t be in the app list screen.One final complaint I\'d like to make is the form factor of the screen. The round screen looks nice and works well when the watch\'s functions are adequately optimized for it. However, not everything can be optimized for such a screen format, and one such thing is reading blocks of text like, say, text messages. Reading phone notifications on this thing is so difficult and inconvenient because of the form factor that you just don\'t bother looking at them.I would give this thing one star, but it does at least one thing right. The Google Wallet function works pretty well. Go figure that the *one* feature that works is the one that involves Google spying on your purchasing habits.Absolutely terrible.']"

I then bought the music edition because it came in black and it cost me about $50 more. I don’t use the music on it. But it doesn’t look cheap and nasty anymore.The Garmin Venu 2 has had an upgrade of what the high end Garmin’s have at the fraction of the price, so this is a good buy.I initially bought this because my $120 cheap Chinese knockoff was not displaying steps correctly, and Garmin states that this version of the watch has advanced sleep technology.And I really wanted that feature.I’m hoping Garmin will read this and fix what issues the watch has, mainly due to the app, rather than the actual watch.I have updated this review for a better judgement of the product. I have tacked on what is now my third review having worn this for six months. The watch has gotten better and more accurate all the time, and has synced in with me giving accurate results.Now the good:The screen is really sensitive and great to use. The quality of the AMOLED screen makes it easy to see at first glance, even during bright sunny days riding my bike. It is water proof to 50 atmospheres, and fits most watch bands in 20mm.I’m really only reviewing what features I use in this watch, and the watch does have a lot more to offer.It has Garmin pay function, so no need to take your card out anymore. It vibrates when the payment goes through to let you know it worked. I’ve done at least hundreds of transactions and it has never let me down.It tracks different exercises well, although when you get really wet it can conk out,  and you will need to dry it off, which is a pain mid workout. Even though the heart rate doesn’t show up when the watch is wet underneath from sweat, it still records the stats. You lose nothing.The “Health Snapshot” is a great feature that you can measure stats at any time of the day and receive a report on what your body is doing at that particular time. This works well & I feel the information is accurate.The messaging notifications are a lot better than other brands, allowing even my security cameras around the house to tell me when they go off.The Stress measure function on the watch has breathing exercises, and relaxation techniques that are very effective when used and well designed.The App Store allows many different downloads (mainly for watch faces), but there are other apps there.  Garmin doesn’t have a large enough quick glance at your watch to see the basic info for people with older aging eyes, but you can find them in the App Store for a couple of dollars per app. This allows you to customise the face of your watch. I’m using green and pink at the moment as they are easy to see with my eyes.Body Battery: This is pretty cool as it takes a score of how much you have rested whilst asleep or just relaxing, it adds that to your day so that you can get busy, do what you want do, and need to do, then it shows you how much energy you have left end of day so you don’t run yourself down too low. The only downside to this is, that if you have a bad sleep score, then that can affect your body battery. An inaccurate sleep score can mess this feature up. See “Advanced Sleep”below to understand what I mean.Graphs: I discovered this totally by accident. I was annoyed that you had only rough graph times on the bottom of the chart giving a guesstimate on the timeframe, but if you place your finger on the graph chart and keep it there, the exact minute comes up telling you the exact time of the chart fluctuations. If you keep your finger on the screen and scroll, you will get a minute by minute time of what is going on with the chart. This is fantastic for those who like to read the graphs, and paints an accurate picture of what is happening at such and such a time. Nowhere have I ever read about this feature, and it really is a great feature.The “Advanced Sleep Tracker” is why I bought this specific watch. After setting it up properly, the app was not working correctly and incredibly inaccurate. I was about to send the watch back before my month was up, but then suddenly around the 3 1/2 week period, the watch started giving me precise times of when I “go to sleep” and when I “wake up” & it hasn’t missed a beat again. I have no idea why it just started working correctly, but if it happens to you,  stick with it, and it should come good. Maybe the watch takes a bit of time to know how your body works? Make sure the sleep times are slightly less “before” you (go to sleep) and a little bit after you normally (wake up). The app keeps telling me that I have had an awful sleep due to REM, deep sleep etc. which states it has been caused by drugs, alcohol, too much exercise close to bedtime, or lots of stress. I don’t have any of those problems, and I tend to feel good when I wake up. I find this a bit of a bummer that Garmin gives quite negative feedback and poor scores based on a percentage of different sleep stages. And for some reason the sleep scores tell me that I have been awake for an hour or more in small intervals, but I don’t believe this is the case most of the time, it then deducts that time from your sleep, and again your sleep score is more damaged. It also affects your body battery as well, leading to inaccurate scores. I feel slightly cheated because of this. It seems to line up with another tracker I wear on the other wrist, it is mostly accurate (bar awake time). Make sure you are connected to the app when you go to sleep, or it may not record it I have found.The Stress Tracker on the app, tells you constantly (not enough time has elapsed to figure out your stress). If you want to know what your stress levels scores are like, you will need to stay up until 11pm to see results or wait until the next day. It also does not take stress scores from when you are active, which is really silly, as that is the time when you most want to know the results. If you want to figure out what is actually causing that stress at that particular time, and then try to fix it, it is not possible to do this. You can go to your “heart rate” and figure out  the fluctuations in there.The watch will stop getting any statistics quite often, mostly when exercising or doing yard work etc. This is most likely due to sweat, but it should not be happening as it is a fitness tracker, and people sweat.When something goes wrong with the watch and you look for the answer, Garmin help page will state you are wearing the watch either too tight, too loose, or something else the user is doing wrong. It is never Garmins fault. Garmin please take responsibility. I have found slightly loose is better than too tight at night, and the watch doesn’t cut out three hours later.', ""I have had this for almost a year now.  I've not had any issues with it.  Love that I can change the face to fit my needs and track what I want to track.  They have several apps that you can put on the watch to use for different activities like cycling, golfing.  I haven't really gotten it wet yet.  Out of habit, I take it off before showering, swimming, etc.  My other fitness watches were not water resistant/proof.  To me it is a nice size.  People mistake it for an apple watch.  My battery life has been excellent between charges.  I go anywhere from 7 to 14 days between charges and that usually depends on my activity as well as what the level is when I decide to charge it.  Charges quickly as well.  I don't have some things constantly monitor, like the O2, and that helps as well with the battery life, I'm sure.  Depending on what watch face you use, some info may be too small to read if you use reading glasses and don't have them on.  I get notifications for my iPhone and can read the text and see who's calling but cannot respond to call or text from watch.  I'm good with that as it gives me the freedom to not feel like I have to stop what I am doing to answer.  The bands are easy to change out as well."", 'Excelente para mis entrenamientos de marcha atletica', 'I previously had 3 Fitbit watches and they all suffered from the same problem, i.e., short battery life that gets shorter over time.  My last watch, 4 yrs. old, started with about 4 days of battery life.  I finally chose to replace it when it required charging twice a day.  FWIW, nothing wrong with the Fitbit watches I had for my needs but charging them so often was annoying.The Venu Sq 2 meets my personal needs which isn’t all of the available features.  I’m still getting use to the differences on how to access and use the features that I use, as well as the differences in the phone apps.  I also like that the Venu Sq 2 is brighter outside as well as the wrist band is much more comfortable.So far, the battery life, looks like it will last as long as advertised.  I fully charged it on Friday, and it is at 83% 4 days later, but I only used the internal GPS once, and only for about ½ mile to verify that it works.No complaints so far!', 'It took me a long time to hit the “Buy” on a smart/activity watch but I am glad I finally did on this one.

The minimum distance this watch can swim track is 13meters (so be aware of that) and i have found it to have an error rate of less than 1%.  Error rate goes up with pauses/resting and if you change stroke mid lap, but if you just go at a steady pace, (even if you arent swimming a single style the whole time) the error rate is extremely low.', 'I needed a new smart watch, and was seriously considering an Apple Watch, until I realized they needed to be charged daily. I love wearing my smart watch to bed (tracking my sleep and using the silent wrist vibration alarms to wake me up in the morning), so I knew charging daily wouldn’t work for me. Which led me down a rabbit hole of watch research and I landed on this one! I was impressed by the 11 day battery life, and while in reality you’ll use it more quickly (using tracking exercise functions or even having a pretty watch face), but even with doing both of those, I get over a week before I need to charge it. I also LOVE the body battery function - I really helps to drive home how much you need good quality sleep and relaxation! Downsides: no altimeter and needs to pair to a phone to track, but I have my phone with me, so I was okay with this. I think for the price, this watch is excellent, looks great, and I love the functionality! Great investment!']"

I've worn the replacement for a week - and updated it - and it's working fine.I'm changing my rating to 4 stars. If the manufacturer company ever changes the support contact form on their website to not require data items that cannot be ascertained if the product is unable to be turned on, I will consider changing my rating to 5 stars.I do love the watch. But product vendors *have* to support their products.Update #1Initially, I was over the moon when I received this watch. I was so impressed, I talked my husband into getting one.  He's crazy about it, too.  Then, today happened.The app told me there was an update and the button was illuminated that said to transfer it to the watch.  So I did.  The transfer progress bar reached the end, and the watch went dark as if it was restarting.  Except that it didn't.  I tried pressing the start button on the watch, and plugging it in to its charging cable.  No sign of life.Here's the worst part though.  In the app you can go to the Help screen... IF it can sync with the watch.  Obviously, I can't.  Great - no support through the app.  So I found the feedback link in the app.  But that's for suggestions for new or better features.  Undaunted, I went ahead and used it.  I got an auto-response saying they would take my suggestions under consideration.  le sigh.Hoping for the best, I went to the website, and found a Support contact interface.  But you have to be able to enter the build version of the watch into the contact form.  To find the build version, you have to turn on the watch.  I can't turn on the watch, and that's a required field on the Support contact interface.  So I can't reach support that way.Finally, I found an actual email link.  I emailed all of this information to that address.  I got an auto response saying that my email had been blocked.  At this point, I've spent far too much time explaining the problem to nobody.My final, last ditch effort is to come here and change my review to 1 star, in hopes that *someone* from the company will answer me.  If not, I will send this dead watch back to where it came from.If you are considering purchasing this watch, be advised that getting support for a dead unit will be nigh unto impossible.- - - ORIGINAL REVIEW - - -I ordered this on 9/10, received it on 9/11.  When I received the watch, I charged it to 100%. Since 7pm on 9/11, I've taken it off only to shower.  Configuring the phone via the app was mostly intuitive, and I quickly had it set the way I wanted it to remain dark during my sleep cycles.I haven't been tracking my steps as closely as I have my sleep score.  We have a late model Sleep Number bed with the  SleepIQ app, and I've been dissatisfied with the scores on that system because I was sure it was picking up our cats' nocturnal motion rather than my own.  This watch has proven my suspicions.But what seems absolutely stunning to me is the battery life and comfort of this watch.  It's very light in terms of physical weight.  I've been wearing a Samsung Galaxy, and this AmazFit is so much easier to wear.  And two weeks on a single charge is - well, amazing.  Today is 9/25.  I just now plugged it in, and it was still at 22% charge.I'm hopeful that more watch faces become available, or that the app developers will publish a guide to enable users to make and submit their own. I'm hopeful that some of the data which must currently be entered manually can one day be detected via the watch, including blood pressure. Other than these minor details, which are common to Samsung's Galaxy watches as well, I'm well satisfied.I do think I'll update the watch band though.  It isn't uncomfortable in the least, but it's plastic.  I want to dress this fine watch up a bit!  :-)"", ""Background: I'm coming from a Charge 3 and Charge 4, all which broke prematurely due to defects that Fitbit doesn't acknowledge. The 3 was unviewable in daylight after a software update (cough, sus) and the 4 connector snapped over somehow, somewhere.  Didn't see it happen, can't even see where it broke because it's missing but smooth as if it never existed.  Clearly, it must've been something that was glued together and came apart easily and cleanly - which is clearly a defect in manufacturing. Read about people buying multiples and having it happen again around 12 - 14 months!Back to THIS watch.  The petal pink bezel/connectors are really more like rose gold, which is exactly what I wanted, and what it looks like on screen despite the weird name.The good:- it's beautiful- the silicone strap (not pictures) that came with it is so silken, smooth and flexible. WAY comfy, unlike Fitbit bands.- there are tons of beautiful watch faces available- the side button can be configured to launch a specific app- the speaker is nice and loud- lots of music storage space- can answer phone calls from my wrist- has barometric pressure readings (that I can barely understand  - not as helpful as I'd thought)- has weather with wind force!- lots of menus are customizable- uses a standard, universal watch band size 20mm, so you aren't locked into proprietary nonsense if you ever switch-sleep tracking is good-can see Sp02 on command vs. Fitbit- can customize a vibration pattern for different types of alerts!The not so good:- Notifications are a little lacking- unreliable heart rate. Heart rate is only accurate if the watch is tight in the EXACT right place about 1 inch below wrist bone. Tested with Fitbit on other arm and Samsung phone.  When placed correctly, it was accurate but slow to update. Increments are choosable, but still slower to register changes.  Has the ability to be WAY more off than the Fitbit ever was - sometimes it's really just guessing.- the app is okay.  Some of it is great, some less than stellar, but it does get updated so potentially could work out the kinks- doesn't seem to register steps when my arms don't swing on the treadmill, if I'm holding on. I have to switch to ankle wear.It's not as precise as the Fitbit, but it seems to be less proprietary, more full-featured, and reliable as far as I've heard from users in terms of not breaking.  If I trusted Fitbit, the Versa2 would probably be more accurate than this, but I don't. I think if I didn't like this, I'd consider the Amazfit Band7 which does less but is more of a health tracker. But this one is cute and has a big display, so I think I can live with less precise measurements at such a great price.- getting your music in and sorting isn't easy.- battery life sucks, especially if you use any bells and whistlesFor the price, it's a lovely watch."", 'Duramas de 14 días la pila, casi no tiene carátulas pero lo demás excelente, a veces se desconecta del celular pero se resuelve en segundos', ""Excelente experiência com a compra e entrega, havia sido taxada aqui no BR quando chegou, paguei a taxa e fui reembolsada pelo vendedor pois esta incluso pagamento das taxas de importação.

In looking at the route display it showed me deviating from my usual walking route (into the middle of the lake) where I obviously didn’t even go… and then back on track, not sure what that is all aboutHeart rate seems close to accurate but the sleep data I am not so sure about.Anyway, really wanted to like this watch as the appearance and size were great but if the stats are unreliable it is not much use for my purposes.I wouldn’t recommend if you are looking for accuracy.']"

Looks a bit stupid but I’m only bothered about the great function.', 'I swim 5-7 days a week. I was contemplating this or the Delphin. Decided if I was going to spend a couple hundred dollars, I should get an SE Apple Watch and this headset for more functionality outside of the pool.Pros:- when it works, it’s really cool and definitely enhances my swim experience- amazing bass so even when water gets in your ears, you can still hear the beat- great battery life- Simple set up and use...just not for very longCons:- I have Spotify. Something just doesn’t work well enough between the various components for H2O Audio to say this is Spotify compatible at this point in time- after several emails back and forth to troubleshoot, I was told to switch to Apple Music because it should work then. I have thousands of songs and dozens of playlists on Spotify with a family subscription. Probably not gonna happen- You lose all functionality with your Apple Watch for Fitness/Move rings, heart rate, oxygen measurement, etc, because the watch is on the back of your goggles- The app provided is wildly off on lap counting and will only close out your Move ring when synced- the headset feels incredibly cheap and I feel a good drop would possibly break it- there is a component on the headset that completely comes off which happened to me in the pool while I was trying to get my watch face in it. Tiny blue pieces and a metal bar. Not sure why it’s separate pieces. Not ideal for wet hands- You have to turn your Bluetooth off on your phone, turn off the feature which locks and helps keep water out of your watch face, turn off all other apps- I knock out the earbuds during my backstroke- It can slip off your goggles which isn’t a big deal in a pool but I probably wouldn’t be as comfortable using it in open water as a resultMalfunction Issues:H2O said it’s just Spotify and in some cases, yes, I can totally see that like when Spotify plays 2 songs and just stops. But this cuts out mid song as well. Sometimes, it says it’s all working but it’s not. Sometimes my watch tells me “something went wrong” but doesn’t specify what, sometimes the watch just disappears as on option, sometimes the watch says the connection was handed back to my phone (hence turn the Bluetooth off on your phone). I have to take off my goggles, close our Spotify, reopen Spotify, reconnect to the headset. Sometimes I’ll get 20 minutes out of it. Sometimes I’ll get 5. It seems worse when I’m at the crowded gym pool vs the swimming club pool I use during the week. It cuts out both while submerged and above water.I’m going to test the Bluetooth function of Spotify with something other than this headset to see it Spotify is solely to blame. But...I’m think it’s not *just* Spotify having the issue. And at minimum, if Spotify is the issue, they shouldn’t advertise Spotify as an option.', 'But don’t bother with trying to use the fitness app', 'This is the only option for listening to Audiobooks (Audible) while you swim. Audible requires a registered device and there are no waterproof devices any more.  Several years ago, I bought the AudioFlood waterproof iPod Nano.  Last year, it finally gave up the ghost.  So, the only option is to use a Bluetooth device with the Apple Watch.  I find I swim longer when I am caught up in a good book.I bought the H2O Interval and loved them.  After almost a year, the earbuds started to crackle became barely audible.  I contacted support at H2O Audo hoping to get them repaired.The people were very helpful and pointed out that they were still under warranty.  During my conversations with them, I mentioned that I wear hearing aids (Old guy swimming for 60 years) and if they needed to be replaced them, I would probably buy the newer bone conducting option.I returned them on RMA.  They came back a week later and... They sent the bone conduction version!  Wow!  Better than ever!Observation:  The wires connecting the bone conduction speakers are heavier and appear to be sturdy and more durable.At first, there was some concern because the sound was a little fuzzy when held by my goggle strap.  As soon as my head went under the water, the sound quality was great.  My theory is that with my head out of the water, the goggle straps don\'t hold them securely against the bone so they vibrate on both inner and outer surfaces.  Once in the water, the water acts a backup to dampen the reflected vibration.The apple watch will not track laps while it is not on your wrist (bummer).  H2O Audio now has a ""My Swim Tracker"" app you can download so you can count laps while swimming and listening to books.Summary:  1. Great product.  2. Tech support is helpful and amazing. 3. Get the app.', 'I used this for regular swimming sessions of 40 minutes each. Battery life was fine. Sound quality fine. For the first few months it worked great pairing with my Apple Watch. Then it started to glitch and would not pair. Then one wire ( which seem a bit flimsy tbh) has obviously broken as only a loud buzz now. Now unusable so I am looking into bone connector ones. Shame as this was great for listening to Spotify playlists, and one of the only sets out there which enable you to use streaming services via your watch, as opposed to downloading purchased songs.', 'So…this is a great product. When it works. Definitely has fantastic sound. Super easy to pair with the Apple watch. Adds energy to my swim workout. HOWEVER, I swim every day for 45 minutes straight. Lap swimming. This thing only lasted me 1 month. The right ear bud decided to stop work or only work intermittently. When the right ear bud does decide to work, the speaker sounds like it is blown. Mind you, I don’t put the volume up high, as I still want to hear what is around me. I know I could not have blown the speaker with too high a volume of sound. Most likely the speaker just couldn’t handle the constant water use, which means (as another viewer stated) the technology of “water-resistent” ear buds is not really realized with these buds, as of yet. I will say though, for the 4 weeks these things worked, my work outs were GREAT! Are they worth the price tag??? Absolutely not. Are they worth…say $20 bucks? With the understanding you will need to replace them every month or so? Maybe. For those of you, who don’t mind paying a “tax” for the ability to listen to podcasts, audio books, and music, then these things are (very expensive) but worth it to enjoy a nice workout. On the other hand, like one wise reviewer previously mentioned, should you just give your ears a rest and leave the apple watch on your WRIST and succumb to the meditative nature of the underwater swim workout experience? Yes. Probably. If you want to buy these for a once a month “treat”, eh. Be my guest. I say wait until Amazon day or Turkey weekend to get a good sale price. Enjoy your swim, everyone. 😊', ""If you have an extra apple watch I encourage people to check it out. It is fun to listen to music during a long swim. However, for me it usually works very well the first 10-15 minutes. Then I find myself frequently adjusting the earbuds. I am not sure this is an issue with the product but maybe my ear anatomy? I still use it and enjoy it. Customer service is very responsive and helpful. Warning: try to remember nobody can hear the music but you. Breaking out in a dance or singing to the music when you hit the wall might be met with some concerning glances. Not that it's happened to me."", 'I should start by saying I’ve got an Apple Watch 3, so it’s not the most up-to-date tech, but they do claim it’s compatible so I bought it. I tried it a few times now and the Bluetooth just does not connect for more than five minutes at a time. So having to stop every two or three laps to take off my goggles, re-connect the Bluetooth to the watch, to carry on swimming defeats the object! Also, the volume really isn’t very loud and noisy swimming pool you can’t hear it that well. I’ve also realised that I don’t like not being able to swim with my watch for a fitness tracker. So I’ll keep searching for the ultimate underwater headphones set! Maybe it’s a standalone MP3 player? I don’t think Bluetooth has yet to tech to work underwater as much as it should. Return for refund.']"

Hay varios videos en Youtube que te enseñan a usarlo,  ademas de que la aplicacion de Garmin en el telefono  tiene un sencillo tutorial (demo) que te dice que puede hacer el reloj y como navegar entre sus menus, asi como el uso de sus botones. El origen de mi problema fue que el reloj permanecio sin usarse y lejos ( mas de 8 metros) de mi  telefono por casi una semana, durante este tiempo tambien se agoto su bateria, cuando lo recargue y quise volverlo a vincular al telefono, este no lo reconocia. Tanto el Reloj como el celular se quedaban en modo de vinculacion. Despues de un parde minutos la aplicacion de garmin en el telefono enviaba un mensaje de "" Problema de vinculacionver solucion de problemas"" al tiempo que el reloj salia automaticamente del modo de vinculacion. Intente varias cosas como  prender y apagar mas de una vez el bluethoth tanto en el telefono  como en el reloj, desintale  y volvi a intalar la aplicacion de Garmin, revise que todos los permisos que se requieren en el telefono estuvieran activados para que el reloj tuviera acceso a la informacion del telefono, todo SIN exito. Intenete tambien reiniciar el telefono y encender y apagar el reloj al mismo tiempo. tampoco sin exito. Sin embargo en las intrucciones que la aplicacion despliega en el celular cuando el reloj no puede vincularse mencionan ""REINICIAR RELOJ y TELEFONO"". En el Swim2 eso NO se logra simplemente encendiendo y apagando el reloj (icono de encendido y apagado), hay que entrar en el reloj al menu ""SISTEMA"" pulsando el boton central del lado izquierdo del reloj hasta que este menu aparezca, seleccionarlo con el boton Start/Stop y buscar la ocion ""RESTABLECER"" y seleccinarlo con el boton derecho superior Start/Stop  nuevamente, y listo el telefono se apagara y volvera a encender automaticamente, entonces hay que volver a abrir la aplicacion y buscar el dispósitivo como si fuera la primera vez . Despues de realizar esto no tuve problema para vinciularlos y ya quedo listo otra vez.  Es muy  conveniente en la aplicacion del telefono borrar el dispositivo garmin y desintalar la aplicaion  para volverla a instalar inmediatamente antes de resetear el telefono. Durante el proceso de vinculacion es muy importante en la aplicacion autorizar los permisos de acceso a datos del telefono para que el reloj tenga acceso a ellos, pues de otra forma habra que hacerlo manualmente en el telefono en su menu de configfuracion. Cabe destacar que cuando sucedio este problema y quise usar el reloj en modo de ciclismo el GPS tampoco arranacaba y se se quedaba por tiempo indefinido en modo de busqueda. Despues de resetear el reloj ambos problemas se resolvieron. Es facil pensar que se trata de un problema de hardware y que el reloj se descompuso ya que al un principio el reloj funciono perfectamente, estuve a punto de iniciar el proceso de devolucion, afortunadamente en realidad solo se necesita  resetear el reloj, es un procedimiento muy sencillo para volver a dejarlo operacional. Espero esta informacion le sea de utilidad a alguien mas. Estoy muy contento con mi reloj.', ""I tried all the options listed in the title.  Everything including a Polar with a strap was far less accurate on HBPM, and some watches wouldn't show the BPM during work at all without having to stop.Fitbit's sleep monitor is better.  Nothing on the cheapo PRC imitation Fitbit is better.  The Polar was bought with a strap, desperate to get a current production Polar to work as well as the one I had 20 years ago (fail, totally disappointing).The only negative I would have to confirm from other reviews is that the lap counter isn't very accurate, at least for me, swimming 30-70 25 yard laps.  This may be (reading some other reviews) because I hardly push off the wall at all.  I'm not trying to work less per lap (I swim for fitness and to lose weight).  I wore a Fitbit and the Swim 2 for 65 laps today, and the Fitbit counted the 65 correctly, even failing to turn it off getting out of the pool, whereas the Swim 2 overcounted by 2 (it counted 67) -- that also means it misreports my lap times for 100 yards, since it miscounts the laps but not the time.If I had it all to do over again, I would just get the Swim 2 and skip all the other disappointing less expensive tries (wasted time I won't get back).  The sleep function and slimness of the Fitbit are nice, but I suspect like most people I know I'll stop using the sleep monitor soon, because it makes me think too much about sleep (as opposed to just sleeping)."", 'Me ha ido muy bien con este reloj funciona perfecto', 'Gostei mais que a tela é de fácil leitura durante o nado.', 'Ótima ferramenta', 'My Iwatch stopped working, as they do.

If you are training for something more competitive, you may need something more expensive/ accurate.', ""Update 16June2022: I just want to give a shout out for Garmin phone support. I was having trouble getting GPS to find satellites this summer, and it was losing track mid swim.  Mary Beth at Gamin support walked me through several paths to finally get the find time down to under a minute. She was patient and seemed genuinely interested in solving my problem -- a rare event from support lines these days. I'm still loving my Swim 2 after nearly a year.------- original review --------------My earlier Garmin Forerunner 310XT wrist GPS takes forever to achieve satellite lock, and it showed me zipping back and forth while I was open-water swimming, so I needed something new. It's all in the software, because a watch on your wrist will lose a satellite or two while it's under water, and the software needs to adjust for this and not think you have zoomed at high speed to the point where it regains satellite lock. Garmin has been working on this issue for some years, (as have others) and I'm very pleased with the results.I also borrowed an Apple watch for a few open-water swims. Tracking was excellent, but it has a feature that locks out any screen actions while swimming, making it somewhat difficult to control. Also, the Garmin is really built for swimming, so it has many more swimming metrics besides speed that make tracking your progress easier. The other advantage is that the Swim 2 software interface is very smooth on a PC, whereas you have to interact with an Apple watch with an iPad, Mac, etc. (There may be options for the interface that I'm not aware of.)The real killer for my use of the Apple watch was that it was less reliable reading my pulse while swimming. Both Apple and Garmin use optical pulse measurement, which is a bit dicey in the water (both say to adjust the band tight but comfortable), but often I would finish a swim to find that the Apple watch had not recorded my pulse at all. The Garmin may make some mistakes occasionally, but it keeps doing the best it can.Controlling the Garmin is not as intuitive as the Apple watch, but once I got used to it I didn't start activities unintentionally or make similar mistakes too often.On balance, the Garmin Swim 2 is a keeper and has replaced my Timex Triathlon as my main watch. The alarm, timer, and stopwatch features are more flexible than the old Timex and get a lot of use.""]"

I prefer those places, stores I think they were called, when I could go in person, check out the size, test it, feel it, to figure out the right purchase for me. After spending a ridiculous amount of time researching and debating with myself, is this the right watch, is this size going to be too big, etc., I finally purchased this watch and I\'m so glad I did! I have a Note 8 phone. Great phone, but the battery is losing life and I have to charge it several times a day. I know the easy fix is to spend $1000 plus and buy a new phone, but frankly, why? This phone doesn\'t have a scratch on it and does everything I need (except the obvious problem of holding a charge). So I finally broke down and bought this watch as a way to ease some of the strain on my phone battery. It\'s been a great solution so far. It\'s paired perfectly with my phone. I\'m able to answer and make phone calls on it, and read and do basic responses to emails, texts and what\'s app chats. It does occassionally become unpaired from my phone in the house if the watch and phone are too far apart, but the watch simply switches over to my home wifi network so I don\'t lose any capabilities with it. Not a problem for me. I have not gotten it wet because I\'m not interested in potentially buying a new watch due to water damage based in all the reviews I\'ve read. The battery has been just fine for me, it is usually at 65% or so after 14 hours of pretty heavy use, but in all fairness, I don\'t have the heart rate monitor constantly running (but I do have the watch face set to always on). I\'m tall, 6\'1"", but with pretty tiny wrists (not much bigger than my 4 year old daughter\'s) and the 44 mm is perfect. Had I gone with the smaller size, it would have been too small for me. The phone battery is lasting longer because I don\'t have to keep checking it for every work email and this watch has been great. Gotta say, I kinda like also that I can swap out wristbands really easily to change the look of the watch.', 'A little over a year ago my daughter love her to death but in a Samsung J3 prime for one of our friends who didn’t actually need a new phone. About a week ago I was informed that my old Samsung phone and I mean really old would no longer be supported by my cell phone service. During that time everyone has laughed at me for having such an old phone, but I loved the phone and rarely used it. During that time my husband got an iPhone and my daughter gave him a watch that works with it. So thinking that I should probably head into the current century by two but the active to watch that pairs with the Samsung phone. I was a bit hesitant initially because I was unable to find any information telling me whether or not the fun that I had would pair with the watch. I did a little bit of reading and went ahead and ordered the watch anyway, suspecting that if it didn’t pair with the phone I could at least use it without the phone.I am not in anyway a techno geek, but I was able to charge the watch, and the Samsung wearable app was already on it, so I followed the steps to pair it with the watch and presto change oh within an hour after starting I was done pairing it and putting information into it that is synchronized with the Samsung fitness app which I also was able to download without any kind of hassle. So for all those people wondering if it paired with the J3, yes it Samsung wearable app was already on it, so I followed the steps to pair it with the watch and presto change oh within an hour after starting I was done pairing it and putting information into it that is synchronized with the Samsung fitness app which I also was able to download without any kind of hassle. So for all of those people wondering if it paired with the J3, yes it does. I did however add extra storage space to the phone and toggle it to move most of the information into the SD card. I don’t know if I explained up properly but initially the phone that I had when it started the pairing process said that my phone didn’t have enough storage. But I discovered that I hadn’t turned the phone on so it couldn’t really pair with it until I turned it on but then after I did magic occurred.I did some adjustments on the settings, and slept with it all night and in fact it did track my sleep. The watchband is very comfortable, but I did notice that the one that I bought had a pretty large band on it so I have it on the second tightest hole. The nice thing about the Band is that it tucks under The other side of the watch band after you have secured it on your arm. So there’s no need really to adjust the band, at least for me. It did track my sleep it does seem to track my activity levels, and the steps that I take and I also track my food intake anyway and so the app actually takes care of that so I don’t have to write it down in a journal.I gave it a fiveThe other side of the watch band after you have secured it on your arm.

It did track my sleep it does seem to track my activity levels, and the steps that I take and I also track my food intake anyway and so the app actually takes care of that so I don’t have to write it down in a journal.I gave it a five for durability. Not so much based on the fact that I have had to watch for a little less than 24 hours but because based upon the design the size the watchband it appears to be made so that it is durable, at least enough to fool a first time buyer. I have yet to discover how to use the voice to text on it, but I am receiving emails weather reports and other things that will probably take up too much of my personal time, but overall it seems to be working quite well and I am impressed because a non-techno geek like me was actually able to pair the watch with the phone and carry-on without the stress or grief or regrets that I purchased the watch.So my daughter was pretty impressed that I was able to do all of that all on my very own. So I guess I’m living in the new Century now linked to my cell phone as though it was an appendage of my body and wearing a synchronized apparatus that is being worn on an appendage of my body.UPDATE. So sad to report the watch is in the watch hospital for the second time. I was able to over time use most functions. But I live in a two story home and it wouldn’t count floors. I tried everything on line, then the non techno geek in me finally called the Company, we tried everything, which included a lot of running up and down stairs so in it went for a replacement for the altimeter. It didn’t work after they returned it. I could tel the didn’t functionally test it because there were no stairs counted. I called again, same thing. Tried all the settings, up and down the stairs swinging arms. Now the bad part is that I Live in Hawaii and they don’t cover mailing. It’s a bit expensive. All told, the customer service is good. Polite, knowledgeable etc. I asked them to be sure to test it functionally before they send it back. We’ll see. I have a sleep disorder and it seems to track my sleep, heartbeat and activity level. But one of the main reasons I bought it was to track how many times I trek up and down the stairs. It’s been gone over 2 weeks now, so I hope they got it and fix it or give me a new watch.', 'I have been wanting a smart watch for a while and finally decided to stop wanting and actually get one.  I looked at a few different brands and most of them were either not so smart (couldn\'t answer calls / reply to texts directly from the watch) or they were way too expensive ($300+).  I stumbled across this gem (at $200) and after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try.  I am NOT sorry I did!It took about an hour and a half to have it fully set up (updating software, downloading apps, linking Samsung account, setting up Samsung Pay, customizing the watch apps, widgets, watch face style, etc.)  I love being able to adjust settings from both the watch and through the phone app (picture 2).  I have a non-Samsung Android phone and have had absolutely NO issues with pairing, data syncing, or notifications between watch and phone.There was a small glitch when initially setting up / updating Bixby (which is needed for voice commands) but after a few failed attempts, I restarted the watch and tried again and the app updated as required and it\'s been working perfectly ever since.  Also, the first night, it didn\'t track my sleep AT ALL (which isn\'t a huge issue for me but a slight disappointment) but the next night it tracked  my sleep flawlessly and the information provided in the app is quite detailed (see picture 3).Voice command features (setting alarms and timers, creating reminders, replying to texts, etc.) work without a hitch which is great as this is one of the key features I was looking for in a smart watch. The call quality is really good (considering this is a watch and not a phone).  The call sound was crisp and clear on my end and the caller didn\'t mention any issues with being able to hear me on their end either.I can\'t speak to the overall battery life BUT as you can see in the picture, I have 16 hrs and 38 mins left at 40% battery.  I put the watch on Friday night at around 10 pm with 100% charge and it\'s now 8:30-ish on Sunday morning.  Given the projected time left I will get a full 2 days+ with a single charge.  **NOTE: I did NOT cycle the battery yet and I\'ve been ""playing"" with the watch a lot since it\'s new.  It is likely that under ""normal"" wear and after cycling the battery once or twice it last even longer on a single charge.The Samsung Pay feature is an added bonus (I used it for the first time yesterday!!!).  You can set a pin number to enter prior to paying which is an added security feature.  Other apps and widgets are available to meet your needs including calendars, weather apps, find my phone/find my watch, and of course the fitness apps!!!  There are a variety of apps / features to choose from and you can pick and choose what you want to use.  You can set your own fitness goals and track your progress through both your phone and you watch.There honestly isn\'t a single thing I don\'t love about this watch!  It\'s well worth the $200 price tag (in my opinion).  I haven\'t found another watch on the market that is able to do everything this watch does for a lower price point.  If you\'re looking for just a fitness tracker without the added features of making/answering phone calls, receiving/replying to texts, paying for purchases, and streaming music (a feature I haven\'t used yet), then don\'t waste your money as there are plenty of other, more affordable fitness trackers out there.

The gps on this watch means I don\'t have to. Accurate enough for my needs, it tracks my routes and syncs to my phone when I get home. Perfect.I like that I get more of a preview of my emails and texts as well, thanks to a decent sized screen.If you use MIUI on your phone make sure you set the Mi Fitness partner app to have permission to always run in the background. MIUI turns things like that off to save battery life, which is great but it stops the notifications coming through on your watch.Watch battery is lasting about 2 weeks on a single charge. Not as good as the Mi Band of course (that could do about 8 weeks!!), but still not too shabby.Only two foibles I\'ve found so far is each morning it automatically reenables ""Raise to Wake"" which is annoying since in the dark of the bedroom the watch it bright, so I have to turn it back off through bleary eyes each day. Also haven\'t found a single theme that shows the date in UK format as well as time, steps, calories and battery life, but that\'s a minor one for me.Overall really happy with this watch.

I can confidently trust the stats it provides.  User-Friendly Interface: Navigating through the menus is intuitive, even for someone like me who's not tech-savvy. The touchscreen is responsive, and the button controls are handy for quick access to certain features.  Battery Life: I'm impressed by the battery life of this watch. It easily lasts me several days on a single charge, even with regular use and GPS tracking during my runs.  Training Recommendations: The training recommendations are a great feature for those looking to improve their performance. It provides valuable insights into my progress and suggests workouts based on my fitness level.Cons:  Limited Smartwatch Features: While it does have some smartwatch functions, they are quite basic compared to other smartwatches on the market. Don't expect it to replace your smartphone for notifications and apps.  No Music Storage: I wish it had the capability to store music or connect to music streaming services. Carrying a separate music device or smartphone can be a hassle during workouts.  Design Aesthetics: The design is functional but not very stylish. It's a bit bulky on the wrist, and the screen resolution could be better. It's more of a fitness tool than a fashion statement.In summary, the Garmin Forerunner 55 is an excellent fitness companion, especially for those who prioritize accurate tracking and training recommendations. Its battery life and user-friendly interface make it a reliable choice for tracking your fitness journey. However, if you're looking for advanced smartwatch features or a stylish design, you might want to consider other options.

Talvez em versoes mais modernas ou até que tenha um aparelho de tamanho maior e provavelmente precise de um chip de alguma operadora.A bateria eu gostaria que durasse mais.

Atenção: ele não tem recurso para treino de força/musculação.Vi algumas críticas que o relógio não muda de 12/24 e que não muda o idioma. Isso não é verdade.

Para todas atividades físicas desempenhadas é muito satisfatório acompanhar tudo pelo relógio.No mais, ressalto a ótima precisão do GPS, Durabilidade Bateria, funcionalidades disponíveis, Design e um sistema que achei muito da hora chamado de Garmin Coach.

Aufgrund der eingeschränkten Funktionsfähigkeiten im Vergleich zu höherpreisigen Modellen würde ich diese Uhr wirklich nur Leuten empfehlen die damit im flachen Gelände (kein Barometer verbaut) unterwegs sind und einfach ihr Training überwachen wollen. Die App funktioniert tadellos, der Akku hält viele Stunden. Ich empfehle wenn nicht benötigt Blutooth und gegebenenfalls auch den Pulsmessfunktion abzuschalten um nochmal mehr Strom zu sparen und die Laufzeit zu verlängern. Was die Herfrequenzmessung angeht so kann ich bestätigen dass die Messung am Handgelenk keinesfalls mit einem Brustgurt mithalten kann. Hier sollte man sich keine Wunder erwarten (die Ungenauigkeit ist hoch und teilweise werden absurde Werte geliefert - Dies mag natürlich daran liegen dass man den Sensor nicht immer perfekt an der richtigen Stelle aufliegen hat bzw. die Uhr am Handgelenk natürlich immer ein wenig in Bewegung ist. Ich verwende ihn aber ohnehin nicht. Alle anderen Funktionen absolut super, man kann den Bildschirm nach eigenen Vorlieben konfigurieren und hat somit immer jene Statistiken vor Augen die einem persönlich wichtig sind.Fazit: Gute funktionale Uhr für wenig Geld, am besten geeignet für simples Lauftraining. Ich bin zufrieden.', 'Die Forerunner 55 von Garmin ist eine solide Smartwatch für Läufer, die ich mit 4 von 5 Sternen bewerte. Nach langen Jahren mit einer Polar Vantage V bei der der Akku den Geist aufgab suchte ich als Läufer nach einer etwas einfacheren, aber funktionalen Uhr.Hier kommt auch schon der größte Pluspunkt. Die Batterielaufzeit beeindruckte mich bei deaktivierten Aktivitätstrackern und Smartwatch-Funktionen mit über 14 Tagen.Das GPS ist weniger genau als bei meiner teureren POLAR Vantage V, erfüllt aber dennoch seinen Zweck.Die Herzfrequenzmessung ist vergleichbar genau, obwohl ich persönlich aufgrund der Genauigkeit lieber auf einen Brustgurt vertraue. Auch bei der wesentlich teureren Vantage V.Die Uhr ist mit Bluetooth-Accessoires wie Brustgurten kompatibel, was eine gute Option ist und wichtig für mich war.Die Anpassbarkeit der Bildschirme während des Trainings ist praktisch, aber die fehlende Möglichkeit, Herzfrequenzzonen mit anderen Daten auf einen Bildschirm zu mischen, ist ein kleines Manko.Der Tragekomfort ist angenehm, und das Fehlen eines Touchscreens empfinde ich nicht als Nachteil.Die Uhr ist besonders für Läufer geeignet, doch für Triathleten oder leidenschaftliche Sportler könnte sie etwas zu einfach sein, da sie einige fortgeschrittene Funktionen wie einen Wattmesser für das Radfahren nicht bietet.Den VO2max kann sie z.B. messen. Den Ox und HRV dafür nicht.Die Messungen für Schlaf und Regenerationsphasen finde ich ausreichend. Bei Polar empfand ich diese Informationen jedoch etwas ansprechender aufbereitet.Die Verwendung der Uhr ohne ständige Datenauswertung und Aufladung empfinde ich als angenehm und weniger stressig.Die Fitnesstracker habe ich ausgeschaltet, was für mich perfekt ist.Insgesamt gesehen ist die Forerunner 55 eine zuverlässige Laufuhr mit einem ausgewogenen Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis. Sie erfüllt meine Bedürfnisse als Läufer und bietet die nötigen Funktionen, ohne mich mit übermäßigem Datentracking und Sport- und Regenerationsprofilen zu überwältigen.', 'J’ai acheté cette montre et je l’ai renvoyé car la résolution de l’écran était médiocre et le cadran trop petit.

So far very good watch and clear display. One minor product design flaw would be unable to receive notifications for whatsapp calls.good batt life', ""So I bought the GTR 2 for a pretty respectable price (~$125) on a daily sale. I'd been using an LG Urbane Wear OS smartwatch for awhile that's getting long in the tooth, so I read some reviews, of Android-compatible smartwatches in general and this one in particular; I noted that it claims to support Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, GPS, etc. I was aware that this doesn't run Wear OS, but was overall satisfied with the features for the price (and I still am, after having used it for a few months now.) Without going into a more detailed review that you can find elsewhere, and especially considering that there's already a successor to this generation of Amazfit smartwatches, I'll just detail one important thing to note if you're considering purchasing this (or any similarly affected) product.Note above that it is advertised as supporting Wi-Fi. This was important, because one handy feature of my old LG Urbane smartwatch is that it can indeed connect to my smartphone over the same WAP, so I can leave it charging somewhere and be elsewhere in the house but still be able to communicate between the two. This is significant because the watch can basically always receive notifications, messages, calls, etc. Well, the GTR 2 does have Wi-Fi as advertised, but kind of not really. You can't actually connect the watch to a WAP; the only thing it can use its Wi-Fi radio for is to establish a Wi-Fi Direct connection to transfer music files to it from the phone, to the former's ~3 GB of available storage. This is functionality that's totally worthless to me, because I don't use the watch to directly stream music, I do that from the smartphone itself, and it doesn't work like my ancient Wear OS smartwatch from 2015 does with regards to being able to connect to a WAP. So it technically does have Wi-Fi, but not really in the sense that you can't actually use it in the way you'd probably expect to, so it's broaching the line of false advertising in my opinion.Other than that, it's a nice watch. The look/size/shape/weight are all fine, and I put a black magnetic mesh band on it. It has a mic & speaker that you can use for calls, but I couldn't figure out how to trigger them at will (i.e. for listening to any audio playback, even voicemail,) although it did work the one time I had someone test call me (other than that, I don't make too many phone calls nowadays!) The battery would probably last about 2 days based on my usage (always-on display, no continuous health monitoring features active) but I top it off daily. So I think I would buy it again at the same price I paid, but I'd also be willing to pay more for a watch that actually has Wi-Fi that works like my last smartwatch."", ""See headline above. Works great, but confuses my old brain...Make sure to understand how to properly use this device. It works great, but I'm constantly going back to the instruction sheet."", 'Llevo ya bastante tiempo con el y la verdad es que es una gran compra en relación calidad precio, sin duda alguna lo mejor es su autonomía.', 'La bateria del Reloj es muy buena.Pero veces no sincroniza en tiempo real la mensajeria de Whatsapp o no sincroniza el reloj con la aplicacion del telefono', 'Prático para o dia a dia, porém quando o visor entra em contato com a água, o mesmo fica ""meio"" sem comando e há uma dificuldade com o touch e para as atividades físicas, o usuário, não tem um indicador/sensor informando a velocidade média/ritmo e batimentos cardíacos durante as atividades.', 'Bom designer, atrasou a entrega, cumpre o que promete, todos os recursos ligados e chegou no dia 01/08 e até hj 11/08 não carreguei e estar com 20% de bateria ainda.Mas pelo preço, poderia ver pressão e saturação e opção de fazer ligação,Porém cumpre o que promete no enunciado.Foi para presente e meu marido amou', ""It is not the first time that I have bought an Amazfit watch, I've had 3 or four watches, but they were cheaper models like the Bip.I bought the GTR 2 because I wanted to be able to answer a call straight from my watch.I usually use it when my phone is charging, and I don't want to be sitting close to the electrical outlet.The call quality is excellent, my callers don't notice anything different when I answer on my watch.If you want it to monitor your sleep you will have to sleep with your watch on, which some people find difficult. I love this feature because it will give you a grade depending on the amount of sleep and the quality of it. Some of the things that it monitors are the time you are asleep, the times you wake up during the night, the amount of REM sleep, and the amount of deep sleep.Another feature that I use frequently is the Workout mode. I start a basketball workout when I start playing and it will log the duration of the workout, the calories that you burned, and the intensity of the workout.The app is not very useful to use at first, but I am pretty good at using it because all the models use the same app.One of the things that I had trouble with, is the notifications because you need to go to the settings and select all the apps that you want to show on your watch. You also need to set up the watch to be able to answer calls, otherwise, it will tell you that somebody is calling you but you won't be able to answer the call.Pros:Great quality when answering calls on your watch.A ton of great features for the price: Workout mode, step counter, Alexa integrated (I haven't used this feature, but some people will find it useful), you can control your music (pause, previous track, next track)Very useful app.Great battery life and is very fast to charge.Cons:The app is not very intuitive at the beginning, and some people will find it confusing or difficult to find the setting you want.Sometimes the watch disconnects when you charge it and it won't easily connect back (I reboot the watch first, and if that doesn't work I will restart my phone)In conclusion, I would recommend this watch if you don't mind spending some time at the beginning to do all the setup."", 'Cumple todo lo prometido tanto en batería como en funciones es de buenos materiales', ""I primarily ordered the GTR2 (sports version) for the looks and after doing a lot of research decided to try it out. I had 3 different Fitbit devices and they all failed on me (hardware issues) so I wanted something different but affordable. The GTR 2 has nice looks but still has some flaws. I had it for a week now, was frustrated at the start but it kept growing on me. I'm still considering returning it but will give it another week and see.Here the issues I noticed:- No BMR calorie counting. It only reasonably counts calories when you specifically perform a workout activity. Outside that time the watch thinks you are dead meat with no calorie consumption. So these are only the active calories being counted here. No option to change that. But just running is not enough, you have to start the workout activity, else the calories won't be properly counted.- Automatic workout detection not working- Heartrate monitor is unreliable. While having a stroll around the block the numbers sometimes jump up and down anywhere between 70 to 130. Yes I wear the watch properly.- GPS is a bit rough and plots the line within a 200 meters range, even when you run a straight line on open field it sometimes looks like a zigzag on the map- Forget the music player. It's awful. No support for Spotify (as advertised). It only accepts local MP3 or Wav files. Did not let me load my Apple purchased music, only the old MP3s I ripped from my CDs. When you try to load anything else from your phone it just locks up the app, but no error message or info there about that. It took me 3 days to figure that out.- Volume control for playing music is also terribly complicated since you are forced to wipe thru the menu to find the control.- Sleep tracking unreliable. It seems to start too late and ignore my first hr of sleep. End time seems accurate. Sometimes naps don't recognize. So overall I'm always 2 hrs short on my recording.- The mobile app is ok  - may have a few usability issues but I'm sure that will be fixed - nice charts and some good explanations are there.What I like about the watch:- Looks pretty good, big display with nice colors, thin bezel only so max use of watch diameter is for display- I like the PAI as a concept (Personal Activity Indicator - 7 day goal of staying active). Also the visual support for you current health age. It kind of got me motivated to walk and run more to get those numbers show up better.- Very responsive and fluid touch screen.- Some nice watch faces, total of 50+ free to choose. No 3rd party store though.- Nice charts and reports generate on the watch for each workout. So you get all that without needing to open the phone app.- Voice Commands work great and this seems to be a mature feature. You can control the watch with your voice, open apps and control workouts. Just flip arm and say 'Start Running'.  It launches the 'running' workout, starts the GPS and you go running without having to even touch the watch.- Ability to take phone calls on the watch - seems flaky though and sometimes didn't work or words cut off on my end.So if you like the looks of this watch and the available 50 watch faces, don't need the music function and you are more of a casual athlete not requiring exact data, just a bit of extra motivation, then this watch may work and be fine. Else -  for more serious action look for something else I'd say.""]"

I\'ll start with the bad, and then the good, though generally it\'s best to go the other way around.  Here are the things I\'ve seen left out of other people\'s positive reviews.The bad...The documentation is mediocre at best.  The paper product manual\'s physical length is half of my hand\'s length, and the print is so microscopic that I had trouble trying to read it with glasses.  It covers some basics, and that\'s about it.The online documentation for pairing the device and using the Zepp app was lousy; instructions were both vague and inaccurate.  I had to let my previous experience of Bluetooth devices guide me; that is *not* what a good set of instructions does.The music function of the Zepp app allows for upload of music and nothing else.  There is no sign of how one could delete music in the app or documentation or the watch.  One can delete music from the watch, but I had to do a YouTube search to find out how, and one has to individually delete each song; there is nothing like folder access to delete a folder\'s-worth of songs.Some of the online documentation stated that by attaching the USB recharger to your computer you could transfer music from your computer to the watch.  Nope, not true.  The charger has exactly two pins for recharging and zero pins for data transfer.I bought the watch because it could store music on the watch becaue I want to listent to music on the elliptical with having to take my smart phone as well as the watch.  All the music was put into one single playlist which, when you have 3 gigs of music means you would need a search function to efficiently find a particular song; there is no search function in the music app on the watch.The music app shows a ""My collection"" option.  Could that be where the playlists can be made?  Nope, no sign of that functionality.  Now let\'s think about that.  I want different content when I\'m on the elliptical (music) versus when I am taking a walk (podcast) versus when I take an educational walk (foreign-language audio course), etc.The good... it\'s a serviceable fitness watch with lots of clock faces.Conclusion:  The documentation sucks, and the lack of playlist functionality is fatal for my purposes. purposes.  I will return the product.']"

Updated heart rate sensor and massive battery life is a huge boon. It last for 11 days with every damn thing and sensor ON.I'm a very extensive and rugged user of watch, this watch has been with me for last 15 days and I must say I'm very much impressed. For all the functions I'll suggest you to watch youtube videos of desfit, chase the summit and dc rainmaker, they do lot of fitness watch stuff and they are good.It takes some time to get used to interface of Garmin OS but it's simple enough and you get used to it pretty fast.Basic pros of this watch is that it keeps you motivated to keep yourself fit.Garmin has many other premium watches in its arsenal, and instict being the entry level watch, it does not include inbuilt storage for music from your streaming app, I wish they had built that in.Other wise it's a great watch.EditBiggest disappointment is the stock charging cable which comes along with the watch.

Buttons are easy to use and menus are very intuitive. Plenty of tutorials on YouTube on how to use the various functions.3. Solar charging is fantastic. Gave me 1 additional day of charge after just 15min in the midday sun.4. The screen is crisp and clear. Not coloured, nor touch, but that really doesn’t matter to me. Touchscreens are annoying and colour only uses up battery life.5. The activity tracking is great. With MoveIQ enabled, it detected my cycle ride and recorded the time and effort accurately. GPS was switched off, so the ride was not mapped.6. Tracked my strength training session reasonably accurately.7. The pulse oximeter is accurate. I checked it against a fingertip oximeter and the readings matched on all occasions.8. Very easy and seamless integration with the Garmin Connect (iOS) app, and Garmin Express desktop application.Can’t wait now to go out and record a hike, when it is safe to do so!Cons: Nothing that I can think of immediately!This truly is THE watch for the outdoorsman (or woman!). As good as one that costs twice as much.Bought this shortly before the current lockdown started, so thanks to Amazon for a brilliant job of delivering it in less than a week, in the circumstances.']"

It looks and feels  rather durable and the straps can be adjusted pretty small. I had to cut a piece of it because my son\'s wrist is very small. it has a camera and video, so far it\'s worked without any glitches. My son had it on his wrist constantly for about a week until he moved on to something else (as they all do) he does from time to time take it and play with it show it to his friends. For less than $60 this will entertain your kids just as much as an apple Smartwarch.  the thing I like about it is it has active apps on it which require the kids to move around,  I rarely see him sitting in one place and playing with it.  I\'m not entirely sure the difference between the cheaper model as I think I paid a little bit extra for some ""special edition wrist band"" honestly I could have done without it.

The activities are quite limited but you can download a few more games from the Vtech site. There is no WiFi which is a downfall and it’s not that straight forward to navigate the downloads. I would rate this 5 stars if it included some way communicate with parents.', 'Kids love technology and most of all they love to play. This watch will give them the opportunity to pretend they are grown ups and to take pictures, make videos and do all sort of pretty stuff with a smart watch just like we grown ups do. This has games and stuff they like and my kid got really excited when he recieved this as one of his christmas presents. It is fun and easy to use  anywhere. The battery last for a appropriate time.

There are so many activities on it, and some that even get him moving (running, jumping).

By the time he works out what he needs to do, it's making him restart. Especially the mouse game. I've sat with it a few times and struggled to get the cheese and keys in time. Can be frustrating for him, but I figure he will get better as he gets older."", ""I purchased this for my grandson. He loved it.

It can’t call or text from the watch itself, but those are features I rarely used on my Apple Watch anyway. It’ll still show you if you have a text, call, or any other notification but is geared toward being more of a great activity watch than a phone on your wrist.What’s great about this is how jam-packed with features it is. They took a ton of stuff that previously was only available in the fenix and epix watches and brought it to this instinct 2x solar. It has sleep tracking, activity tracking (with customizable screens for each activity), training readiness, heart rate, vo2 max, blood oxygen level, etc.  Most apps charge money for the amount of detail this watch and app give you about your day to day and activities, but there’s no subscription on this. It’s all freeAnd it constantly checks heart rate. My old Apple Watch would check periodically but you could never glance down and see what the current hr was without tapping on the icon and waiting. With this watch it constantly is reading heart rate and keeps a graph showing the history (which you can have show on the watch face if you want).The battery is awesome, something like 40 days with how I have mine set up. And the solar charging actually works. I’ve heard that past versions it didn’t help all too much, but this one it really makes a difference. I added 2 days to my battery life from just a few hours in direct sunlight.The only places where this watch is lesser are the display and the navigation. If detailed maps and touch screen/oled screen are important to you, then go with the fenix or epix models. The navigation on this watch can be useful as it includes the trackback feature where it’ll guide you back on the path you came in on, line-of-sight tracking (keeps you on path if you have to go like down in a valley or around an obstacle where you might lose sense of direction), and you can even pre-load courses to follow later. However, it’s a pretty bare-bones navigation map. It has a pointer for your watch and a line showing the path and that’s about it. The epix and fenix watches have nicer displays, color, touchscreen, and more detailed maps which help a lot with navigation but you also sacrifice a significant amount of battery life for those features. And they’re double the price of this one.All in all, I think this is the perfect middle point for a watch. It has all the features from the top of the line ones that I need, along with crazy battery life and a decent price. If you don’t need detailed navigation but want great gps and activity tracking at half the cost of some of those other watches, this is a great option.', ""Apple watch was good for all day if I didn't have an exercise period of more than hour. This watch is not nearly as integrated with my phone, but the battery will last for weeks. There's a pretty steep learning curve, partly because there are so many functions. I was concerned about it being so bulky and thick, but I really don't notice it any more than I did the Apple watch. I love this watch."", ""I dunno what the negative reviews are going on about, this watch is greattttttttttt and a huge upgrade over the instinct 1 non-solar, that felt lacking yet this has all the extra things I wanted. I am coming from a samsung galaxy watch 4 classic, and while that was nice at the time, the battery was not whereas for this, it says weeks long battery life makes me at ease of not having charging anxiety every night hahaha phew. Best upgrade over this from the instinct 1 is more battery life, bigger screen, more features overall, but also having the connect IQ watch app store which allows much more customization than you'd ever hope for.  Better yet, you can even program your own apps/widgets if you're a knowledgable programmer. Overall, daily driver, love having it on. Better yet, if you have a privacy respecting android rom like calyx OS and have micro G  a samsung smartwatch won't work,  BUT THIS WILL. Honestly my samsung watch is kinda a paper weight timer/clock now compared to this. The garmin instinct 2x solar is greattttt. I rated value for 4/5 because nearly $500 is a bit much imho but I guess that's the smartwatch market these days. Also rated sleep tracking 4/5 as well because instinct 1 didn't have sleep score and this does, but honestly unless you get an apple watch or  a dedicated sleep tracker the sleep stages are never truly that accurate. However, you do get to see your stress level, restless moments, and total time slept, so it's still very useful. Better yet, when you wake up you can see how much you're rested via the body battery, and it roughly gives a feeling of your energy for the day. Like going to sleep almost completely drained physically, waking up with only 50% body battery, you're gonna feel tired today. But, waking up with 100% body battery, you probably slept 9 hours or more hahaha. So overall, love having the watch and the garmin connect app."", 'I love my instinct 2x. I have the original Instinct tactical before this and love the battery life. Charge once a month is great. This battery lasts even longer. I love the Moss green and larger bezel.

It does absolutely Nothing! I've tested it many times to see if it even charges. I left it on my porch (dead sun for 9 hours) not on my person just sitting there and the battery lost 2%. While wearing it at Disneyland 13hours straight and it lost 3%.I'm under the impression the solar feature is just a marketing gimmick."", 'I actually loved the functionality of this watch. Garmin does VERY well with their wearables. It’s operates as advertised. Great GPS. Great health tracking. Really great battery life!I’ve been an Apple Watch wearer for several years and attempted the switch to this watch but it didn’t last a week for me unfortunately. For only one reason though. It’s BULKY. I don’t have large wrists and I didn’t expect this watch to be as sleek as the Apple Watch but this thing is a chunk. I didn’t expect it to irritate my wrist as much as it did. I had the watch snug but not tight and as a few days passed the irritation grew worse. So unfortunately I had to part ways with it. It’s just too much money to wear something that’s not comfortable for me. I am aware that this is subjective for each user which is why I wanted to still give it at least 4 stars.I’m still considering switching to a Garmin wearable but I might need to try them on for size first next time!', 'I feel like the term ""smartwatch"" is overused in the industry. All the major players actually strap a ""dumb terminal"" to your wrist, as most functions can\'t be used unless tethered to a phone or the internet. And who wants to charge a watch every day? This simple watch is truly smart, able to perform most functions without internet access or a phone.I feel the only thing offensive about this watch is the price, but you soon forget about the cost of ownership after getting comfortable with the settings which took me about a week to get used to. All the normal functions like health/steps/heart rate are included.* Red light flashlight is perfect for night-time vision and doesn\'t strain eyes* If you are fine wearing a watch to bed then it will let you know how recharged you are for the next day* Used flashlight for about an hour or so at max brightness, it drained only half the battery.* Storm alerts are awesome, uses built-in barometer to measure sudden drop in pressure.* Hold Ctrl/Light for 7 seconds to initiate emergency beacon to ICE contacts* SOS beacon light when stranded in the darkThe battery life and solar charging aspects were very surprising, both are not a gimmick. Watch claims 40 days of battery life at full charge and 99 days in battery saver.* Actually using the watch throughout the day (GPS/compass/flashlight) cuts battery to about 2 weeks* Spending time outside in the sun for work/play actually maintains the watch\'s charge* Gains about a days charge for two hours outside/driving with watch in direct sunlightMy career is in Wireless Communications and involves using a compass and gps coordinates constantly, and looking in tight dark spaces, and unsure footing/ semi-unsafe environments, climbing mountains, scaling towers, etc. This watch is extremely handy and works off-line for most aspects. It\'s the Leatherman of smart watches.']"

The only issue I have is when I workout I do muscle groups and multiple exercises. I'd like to track each one of the exercises I complete but I don't know if this watch or app as this ability. Also, when I do certain abs and leg exercises it doesn't track them either. I'm pretty sure the watch can go for another few days before going completely dead on me!!! I also would like to make a recommendation. Get the screen protectors and multiple pack one!! I already cracked the first one out of the pack trying to help some from killing herself during a bench press. The bar slammed down on the watch but on the protector was damaged!!!! Well worth it and more!!! So, today is the 27th and been wearing this watch since the 12th and woke up to 5% battery life!!!!

After a beautiful relationship that lasted 7 years, I finally had to say goodbye to it because it was down to about 6-7 hours per charge. I've had the T-Rex for two months now and I've only had to charge it twice - and one of those was just to top it off the day I received it. And it recharges in about 45 minutes. Holy cow. I mean, they claim it but I didn't believe it. Then we get to its list of features. I don't typically wear a watch while sleeping, but I've worn this one a few times just to see what it has to report. What it's able to figure out from just a few sensors on the bottom of the watch is pretty impressive. I haven't used its GPS capability yet, but have worn it during workouts and it's impressive there, too. I had never heard of this brand previously so I had a little bit of trepidation, especially with this watch's sticker price, but I have to say that I'm quite happy with the purchase. DO keep in mind that it's a heavy watch, which I knew wouldn't be an issue for me.

This one makes the grade, and it\'s the one I\'ll be using for the foreseeable future. Apparently the name of the watch and model is ""Tank M2"" although as with other imports, if there is a real brand name, it\'s a mystery. The box just says ""Smart Watch."" I found ""Tank M2"" on the enclosed User Manual.Some of what I am about to say is based on other comments I\'ve read here, and I will lead with the most important one for me. I actually purchased this watch because of the claim of long battery life, and so far it is living up to that promise. After 3 days of pretty hard use, the battery is still at 87%, which suggests it will last the two weeks promised. One reason my experience may be better than others is that I don\'t use Bluetooth, don\'t see any reason to use the watch as my phone, and also disabled the feature that turns the watch on if one raises their arm. I know from my experience with other watches that that feature burns  a lot of battery, and I don\'t mind pressing the button when I want to see the time.Several people have commented on the available dial faces and I have to say that I agree that the overwhelming majority of these dials seem to be childish and useless. But all that matters in my opinion is that there are a few dials that serve the purpose, and as you can see in the photo, I\'m perfectly happy with this one.Now for the nitty-gritty on features: the sleep tracker is superb, best one I\'ve found. I can\'t comment on Blood Oxygen because I have no way to know whether that\'s accurate, I guess I hope it is because it\'s giving me a good result. Several people have complained about the Blood Pressure measurement, here I have to strongly disagree and say that this is the best watch for measuring BP I have found. I have a medical cuff, so I can compare results. Of course they are not identical--for that matter, I get different results on my cuff from the one my physician uses. The watch is within 10 points of the cuff on both systolic and diastolic. But that\'s all missing the point. No one should be relying on these sorts of devices for Blood Pressure other than one important thing: if the watch reports that you are having high or low BP, that\'s an indication you should get a check up. That\'s what matters.Of course these watches were designed to count steps, and the step counter on this watch seems to be extremely accurate. There\'s very little lag time between starting to walk and the watch starting to count those steps.This brings me to the one issue I have had, and the reason I\'m withholding one star from my review. For some reason, the watch uses a standard of 4000 steps to a mile. Not only is this wrong according to my other four watches, it\'s wrong by a course I\'ve mapped out using my car\'s odometer. According to all four watches, a mile for me is between 2300 and 2500 steps, and according to the one-mile marked course, I need 2325 steps for that mile. I have contacted the company\'s technical service department, but so far all they\'ve done is offer me an extra watch strap for my inconvenience. I\'m happy to accept the strap, but I\'d also like to have a more accurate distance measure. Wags like to recite ""your mileage may vary"", but here the problem seems to be that the mileage isn\'t varying--it\'s stuck on 4000!The watch does seem to be built like a tank, I have no worries about its durability and water safety. For now at least, this is the watch I\'ll be wearing every day, and compared with the other four watches I have tried, I\'m willing to say it is also the best ""bang for the buck.""', 'I got this watch for two reasons.  I already had a garmin vivosmart 4, which does super-well at SPO2 monitoring in your sleep (mail reason I got it) and remarkably well at activity tracking etc.  It also had a very good android app interface for quickly viewing graphs of its running observations and more.  Its flaws were a watch band that is too short and not adjustable, charge that only lasts for 4-5 days tops, and it ONLY does heart rate and SPO2 for health monitoring.So, I got the AMAZTIM, in order to get a much longer runtime per charge and its blood pressure monitoring as WELL as SPO2 and heart rate.  It is also a much -- much! -- bigger watch than the vivosmart so I thought its interface might be a bit better and access to more advanced smartwatch features better as well.I was mightily disappointed.  The ONLY part of its hype this watch lives up to is its run time per charge, which is easily more than a week, almost two weeks.  What doesn\'t is:  a) Watch faces that look like they were designed and intended for teen-age adolescents who like cartoon animals.  Seriously?  Not one, single, watch face that actually uses the vast real estate of this large watch for something other than cartoons, fancy backgrounds, science-fiction spreads?  Nothing that (for example) displays time/date/heart rate/SPO2/steps/BP?  There\'s plenty of room for all of this...but instead we get cartoon beaches with only the time.  b) The Blood Pressure it measures is completely useless.  I mean, off by 20-30 points useless, when compared to BP taken by actual cuffs by actual nurses or physicians.  20-30 points low useless -- I\'m healthy as a horse according to the watch, 106/66.  Only not -- PROBABLY more like 126/80 -- if not higher (which is the problem).  c) Heart rate is not too accurate either.  I tend to run slow, but it thinks that I\'m up at 82 after sitting completely still for over an hour.  d) SPO2 almost always reads 99%.  I do have an oximeter to compare to, and it reads more like 96-96% where the Garmin reads 94-95%.  I trust the Garmin to be consistently low, because if I e.g. hold my breath to drop SPO2, it remains a couple of percent under.  I\'m not sure I trust the always 99% reading.  Again, great if true, but almost too good.But the worst of all is the Da Fit app.  It isn\'t even in the same UNIVERSE as the Garmin Connect app.  Garmin plots data on an actual graph with time as an actual axis.  You can see how your heart rate changes over the entire day, as it constantly samples it.  It doesn\'t CONSTANTLY sample SPO2 -- I wish -- but it DOES sample it for a selected four hour window while you sleep, making it actually amazingly useful for determining whether or not you have Sleep Apnea when your wife (the physican) thinks EVERYBODY my age has it -- but the Garmin says that I do not.  Just sayin\', worth it right there.  Cheaper and easier and I\'ll bet just as effective as a sleep study, and it runs EVERY NIGHT (one reason the Garmin runs out of charge in five days).The AMAZFIT only samples SPO2 when you, by hand, tell it two -- scroll four screens, press a button, wait.  It doesn\'t automatically sample at night or regularly in some window.  It only samples heart rate when you tell it to -- well, it actually does sample it all of the time but doesn\'t send the data back to the app and display it as a function of TIME.  BP is shown only ""for the last seven times"", but it doesn\'t actually LABEL them with the TIME or DATE you took them.  Ditto SPO2 -- last seven times you hand measured it, without any sort of timestamp, in a BAR CHART not even a graph.Look, almost anybody\'s smart watch will track steps, stairs, hikes, etc -- fitness training is easy if rarely completely accurate as they rely on things like accelerometer reading a lot more than they rely on sampling your GPS coordinates.  The key health metrics they can currently reach are heart rate (a very few more than just ""rate""!), SPO2 (enormously useful if it will run overnight), and blood pressure.  Except that so far, BP just doesn\'t seem to work, and EEG-quality heart results are still only on very expensive watches, and NONE of these are worth much if you can\'t SEE HOW THEY VERY WITH STRESS AND TIME ON A REAL GRAPH.I suppose it is back to the drawing board.  It\'s very difficult to get a clear and unbiased review of what is out there.  I\'m tempted by an EEG-capable watch, but that is super limited right now.  I\'d love accurate -- note accurate, within say 5 torr -- BP, SPO2 (within 2%, consistently one war or the other around oximeter readings), heart rate -- all displayed in real graphs with time axes of a reasonably small granularity -- once a minute, say, or once every fifteen seconds depending on what one is looking at.  WITH week plus runtime per charge.  And sure, with activity/sports stuff too, but that\'s a dime a dozen and easy.', ""I definitely like the fact it comes with a screen protector out of the box. Watch seems durable and is definitely water resistant. The product info says 60 day Cobalt battery.... I burn 10 percent per day that's 10days at most, the pedometer also tracks or counts steps while I'm driving. I average 40%more steps with this watch compared to my last one."", 'I purchased a AMAZTIM 5ATM for my husband primarily to help him keep track of his blood pressure and after researching several smartwatches I decided to go with the AMAZTIM 5ATM.The trouble is I am whatever the opposite of a tech person is and my husband is about as techie as you can be. While he very much appreciated the thought, he immediately knew that neither this smartwatch, nor any other smartwatch, was at all accurate when it came to blood pressure. But he strapped it on and like any other tech person started through all of the options and functions.Naturally, it told the time so we can skip that. What I got from him was the heart rate and O2 were very much in line with a store-bought pulse-oximeter and therefore, as far as he was concerned, reliable and useful.There were a few things that bothered him but I am much more of a positive person so let’s start with the good points. I already mention pulse rate and O2. That seems first rate. Battery life is excellent. Three days and it’s still at 80%. The charger cable, while not the usual mini-USB, connects magnetically. I’m guessing that’s to avoid a slot that water can get into. It’s a nice feature. The watch paired with his iPhone very easily.On the downs-side blood pressure reading were very off but he knew that even if I didn’t and I don’t count it against the product.My husband gets text messages and other app notifications frequently and since he keeps his phone on silent mode and in his pocket, he sometimes misses them. Getting those notifications from the watch sounded like a good deal and he set everything up on the watch and companion phone app, DA Fit, I think it is. He got very frustrated because hardly any notifications from any app came through to the watch. Not zero notifications which would mean it didn’t work at all, but some, which for a very impatient person like himself frustrated him more since he tried to figure it out. He did not figure it out.The weather function, while he didn’t really care about, said it wasn’t paired, which he didn’t know what that meant (the teeny instruction booklet wasn’t helpful), but it did work... once. Again, Mr Frustration cared more about why it worked once than not at all.My husband is an avid cyclist (he’s on his bike more than he’s home sometimes). The Sport Mode, which was supposed to be a long press on the second button, never worked at all.Three categories that really didn’t work is problematic.I did contact the seller and got a prompt next day reply from, I’m assuming, a different time zone. They offered to remediate the issue but unbeknownst to me he sent it back - sigh. I would have given them a chance. Men, right?Bottom line: don’t get any smartwatch for blood pressure and this product in particular has definite shortcomings. The watch itself gets 3 stars but I added a star for the seller who tried to make it right even if my husband didn’t wait.', ""Unlike other watches/apps of watches that allows you to turn on the 24 hours time-frame (Military time: 1300 hours = 1:00pm). You have to turn it on from the watch itself, but it'll turn back to 12 hours time-frame (12:00pm, 1:00pm, 2:00pm, and etc).1 charge doesn't last as much as you would want it to hold. Showering with it on would make the sprinkles click on the screen.It's up to you if you want to buy this and not an actual Galaxy or Apple watch..."", 'This smart watch is good at this price point. Although it’s a little bigger than other smart watches I have owned, it has a lot of features I haven’t seen before. One of the biggest features is that the GPS is pretty accurate and syncs to towers quickly. This is an important feat for those who rely on GPS for workouts. In addition, the steps counter is pretty accurate as well (I find that it’s hard for any smart watch to be 100% accurate). It was quick and easy to set up with the app and syncs with the app quickly. Here are other features I found impressive:- A ton exercise options and sports recognition- Accurate and consistent weather- Ability to a sync contacts and answer phone calls- Displays text and phone notifications- Accurate heart rate and blood oxygen level- Flashlight- Music- The ability to connect your phone’s camera to the watch and command the watch to take the picture (handy if you have your phone propped somewhere to take a group photo)- Find my phone- Touchscreen- Large clock faceI noticed that the watch still receives notifications when my iPhone is on do not disturb mode. For some people this isn’t an issue, but it’s worth noting. Overall, this smart watch has a lot of features at a great price point.', 'Watch itself is ok for the price but it or the charging port stopped charging after only 4 months. UPDATE: Company contacted me after my review and upon me contacting Amazon. Replacement was shipped. Rating improved. Sidenote: after receiving replacement tested old watch on new charger. So the watch  still worked but the Charger did not. Would suggest improving the charger for this watch. Reason for 4 stars and not 5.', 'It doesn’t seem to stay connected with my phone. Just like when I enter my vehicle my phone reconnects. This watch should automatically do as well when I’m back in proximity of it. I don’t have my phone on me every second of the day and the same for the watch. This can be annoying', 'I was going to wait for a friend to set it up but tried myself,to my surprise I set the watch up with relative ease', 'Debería mejorar un poco la app de enlace y el software interno del reloj, no es de uso intuitivo como por ejemplo los amazfit.Excelente material, contra agua y se ve súper resistente']"

I bought this so I could replace both my fitbit and my Garmin golf watch with just one, and one I could use every day.  Well, it's a fine every day watch... but the Golf leaves much to be desired.  My biggest problem is shot tracking.  My 10 year old Garmin Approach S20 worked great.  I don't need a lot of my watch.  Front, Middle and back distances, score tracking and SHOT TRACKING.  What was great about the Garmin was that it was automatic.  The watch knew when you took a shot, and although not absolutely perfect, it was pretty close.  The Samsun requires you to hold the shot button every time you are over your ball to track it.  How could a sophisticated watch like this not have the same capability of a 10 year old Garmin watch?  It makes no sense... so what happens is I don't think to touch the shot button (which you have to hold for a few) each time I get to my ball.  It has all sorts of other bells and whistles and the app is fine, but the Garmin tracked your shot history on a hole and is great for stats.

We contacted Golf Caddie via email and they confirmed the app should be functioning without payment. We we told to contact Samsung Service Center and ask then to install “firmware”. My husband went to the service center and they had no idea what he was talking about. So, we now have the Golf Edition without the functioning golf app we have already paid for. We are exploring our options.', 'Great watch but far too complicated in activating.....need to be a qualified tech to complete it....this is off putting for ordinary customers', ""Doesn't calculate exact yardage sometimes.""]"

I haven't been as active for a while and I feel like the wellness tracking this device offers is perfect for getting me back on track. This has been one of those purchases that I wish I had pulled the trigger on sooner now that I have it.Combined with the web app I really love the amount of detail that I can get and the variety of things I can easily track. I've found the GPS tracking on my longer walks to be very accurate so far. I also enjoy the variety of customization options both native to the watch and through Connect IQ score.I know that the sleep, stress, body battery, etc, are not the most accurate, but they are still a great tool for getting a rough idea of where I can improve. For me, being called out by something as neutral as data is very helpful and I appreciate being able to see trends and make note of things that I could change for the better. I do have to take some of the body measurements with a grain of salt because of medications that I take, like the HRV-based stress readings (always high for me), so you should take that into consideration if you are prescribed any kind of medication that either stimulates or sedates.I am so glad I went with the smaller model, I am a petite person and it feels like the perfect size for my wrist. I don't find it to be obtrusive at all. I don't love the silicone band and am trying to find an alternative that looks better at the office and doesn't bother my skin as much."", ""The Garmin Forerunner® 255S has truly become my absolute favorite smartwatch and has been a key tool through my fitness journey, here's why I love it:Adapting to My Workouts:Although labeled as a running smartwatch, it effortlessly fits into my diverse workout routine. Whether I'm hitting the gym, practicing yoga, or going for a nature walk, it tracks my progress with accuracy.Feels Like Nothing:The lightweight design is a game-changer. During workouts and even during sleep, I barely notice it's there, allowing me to focus solely on my routines.Accurate Insight:From heart rate monitoring to sleep tracking, it offers insights that help me tailor my workouts effectively and monitor my health data reliably and easily. Knowing I can rely on its data keeps me motivated.Part of My Day:Its sleek profile and customizable faces make it not just a workout companion, but an everyday accessory that reflects my style.No Worries About Charging:One thing I appreciate is its impressive battery life. It's a relief knowing I can wear it all day without needing to recharge constantly. For my use, it lasts 11 days before needing a charge. When It does need charging, it charges FAST!In short, the Garmin Forerunner® 255S is more than a gadget; it's a personal fitness partner. It adapts to my routine, offers accurate insights, and feels like a natural extension of my active lifestyle. Whether I'm lifting weights or running errands, it's a constant companion that helps me stay on track and motivated. I highly recommend this watch!"", 'I love this watch. Starting from the fit, it’s comfortable, light, and the perfect size for my smaller wrist. The straps are soft and comfortable so it doesn’t feel like it’s trying to move to the side of my wrist like watches often do. I love the colour and slight orange accents - understated and cool looking. The buttons are clean and crisp and responsive, and the menu layout is intuitive. The running dynamics are amazing - I’ve learned more about my running in the last week than in the 16 years I’ve been running. Power is especially interesting and I’ve used it to build custom interval workouts. I’m not using the cycling features because I have my garmin edge, but it easily broadcasts my HR to that device with fewer button pushes than my lazy device - quick, easy, effective. Insights into v02 max (different for cycling and running, interesting) are surfaced to the watch ad well.I’ve just started an adaptive training plan - can’t say mich about that yet other than I love the concept. It is odd to sign up for a training plan and not see the plan - you can only see the next few workouts as it will be adapted to your needs as you go. Looking forward to seeing how that goes.Predictive paces seem fast. Maybe it’s right, would be nice. Will try pace pro in the future to see.A few notes since this is a triathlon watch - no predictive paces for triathlons, seems to be only for runs and cycling races. No training plans for triathlons. I’m doing a run plan on tne 255 and a bike plan on the edge, but they aren’t integrated and don’t respond to one another. I’ll also be doing a cycling plan on Zwift and that’s just outside of this universe so I’ll have to manage that integration on my own. That’s all fine, but it will be interesting to see if / whether my run plan adapts to my fatigue or fitness changes from the cycling plan. Yesterday I had a gran fondo, which was on the garmin race calendar, yet it still told me to do an easy run as part of my run training plan. It should be easy for her watch to move that run knowing I had a long hard rice to do.Bottom line - fit, comfort, style, and functions are all amazing. Great purchase, very happy.', 'Llego bien y funciona de maravilla', 'BACKGROUNDI am a former serious marathon and ultra runner, cyclist, swimmer, and Ironman triathlete now in my later middle-age period with revised expectations and goals. I\'ve been a Garmin user since the original GPS ""watch"" that required an arm band receiver, and have used the Forerunner 10 and 235 as well. I had no complaints about the capability or performance of the Forerunner 235, but was interested in the expanded health tracking features of the new 255 model. I also listen to music and podcasts on Spotify quite often, and the Music features of this model appealed to me.OVERALL IMPRESSIONS AND HEALTH MONITORINGFirst, I am impressed with the sleep tracking of this model, which I find mostly accurate except sometimes when it doesn\'t distinguish the difference between waking and getting up. I find that tracking HRV (heart rate variability) is a very good indicator of sleep quality in addition to the usual deep sleep, light sleep, REM, awake, etc. markers. This also correlates very well with a feature I especially appreciate, that being Body Battery. I have a standalone pulse oximeter and have not activated that function on this watch.WORKOUT AND GPS TRACKINGAs for GPS and workout performance and tracking, I have found the unit to perform flawlessly thus far, down to the side of the road/lane on which I have run or cycled.GARMIN COACHI have a deep background and understanding of training load and structure, and have coached triathlon professionally in the past. I have also used sites/apps like Training Peaks as a tool, to good effect. I am currently getting back on the road after being sidelined for a long time with back issues and set the goal of completing a half marathon to motivate me and serve as a shorter term goal. Curious about the coaching functions included with this watch, I signed up for one of the plans that is available through the Garmin Connect app, and so far I have found it to be quite good at suggesting workouts and adjusting load and expectations based on completed workouts. It\'s a really cool bonus for me to have at my current level of fitness, and I would recommend the watch to newer endurance athletes over similar products based on this function alone.BATTERY LIFEBattery life is quite adequate and lasts for days without recharging under normal activity. A very nice bonus aspect is that it recharges very quickly using the supplied connector.SOFTWAREThe only negative I\'ve experienced so far is with the software and Music functions. The Garmin Connect app works great and I love being able to configure the displays. As for Music, I am disappointed that the only way to load music to the watch is via the Garmin Express app, which is clunky and outdated. But worse, this app has crashed every single time I try to access the Music Apps tab to connect Spotify. This has happened on both my MacBook Air and iMac, so perhaps it\'s an issue with iOS. It is due to this issue and the inability to take advantage of having Spotify on the watch that causes me to deduct one star, and I can say without reservation that if I had purchased the regular (non-Music) version of this watch I would give it a 5-star rating.SIZING & CONCLUSIONI purchased the smaller (41mm) version of this watch simply because the larger (46mm) size wasn\'t available. It feels a little small, but I can live with it. If I were to go back and order any of the 255 variations (assuming equal availability) I would definitely get the larger version and probably skip the Music edition, although I\'m still hopeful that will be resolved with a software or firmware update.I would recommend this watch to anyone serious about monitoring their health and fitness, who likes to get out on the road and structure their training. It is an excellent training tool and aid, and a great motivator, and although the Music functions do not work at this time for me and I would prefer the larger iteration, I am still very pleased with this watch.', 'I’ve been a Garmin Fan since the first forerunner was released.  I’ve had various Forerunner versions and this one is by far my favorite.  The fast GPS pick up is by far my favorite feature.  As I am a seasoned athlete, the daily workout tips and suggestions were annoying until I turned them off.  The only thing I don’t love is the case size.  The large is a mm larger than the 235 Version (46mm vs 45 mm) and the small is 1.5 mm smaller than the 245 version (41mm vs 42.5mm).  The large is too big for my wrist and the small is too small but a workable option compared the the large version.  I feel like in trying to make this watch more available to all people; they made it ideal for the two extremes of body sizes and the middle group got the shaft this go-round.  The watch would be perfect if it was anywhere between the 42.5mm of the 245 and the 45 mm of the 235.Aesthetically this is the best looking of all the forerunner versions in both sizes; but on my wrist the large is too big and won’t track my wrist heart rate correctly because my bone doesn’t allow the watch to lay flat.  The small looks too small for my wrist.  :(I didn’t realize how much it bothers me.  I had to get a new Garmin when my was broken in a bad accident…. Along with a few of my bones… 😬.I’m a bit disturbed by how much the too small aesthetics of the watch bugs me and wish I would have just bought another 245 because apparently aesthetics are more important to me that the altimeter and quick GPS pick up.  🤷🏻\u200d♀️', 'Produto chegou muito rápido (Rio de Janeiro), 48h após a realização da compra.', 'Tiene tantas funciones como puedas tener una banda de frecuencia cardiaca que ayuda muchísimo para hacer un análisis completo de tu progreso en la disciplina que desees.', 'Me encantó el producto, tiene muchas funcionalidades para ayudar en el seguimiento de carrera.', 'Es mi tercer Garmin (220, 245, 255s), muy cómodo, ligero, multifunciones.

Once it’s paired to your Apple Watch it’s very easy to set up and use… the app itself is bare bones and doesn’t offer much except that your device is connect and via what app or device.

Bluetooth is solid.', 'Got this  device to link my apple watch to my Wahoo app that supports a smart turbo trainer. Previously I had to wear a chest strap and forgot to wear it half of the time. After some reliability problems in its use, I found that positioning of the watch link was important as well as the use of a reliable USB power source. The watch link is now within 6 feet of my turbo trainer and I use a dedicated USB power plug. I have had no problems in reliability since setting the watch link in this manner. It’s great to have my cycle workouts synched seamlessly to my apple stats without the need for a chest strap. The only faff was having to buy it on the US Amazon site as its not available in the U.K.', ""Update 6/22/23Another issue with using this device, vs the standard Apple Watch app for Exercise, is all your workouts are written by Watch Link into your health info.  This is an issue if you want to have this data available/sharable to an app such as Strava.  Strava will read and import anything written by the Apple Exercise app, but completely ignore anything written by Watch Link, as if it doesn't exist.Update 6/12/23Some software/firmware updates appear to have made this much more stable and reliable. I noticed the issue with not ending the exercise and moving out of range appears to be fixed too.Thanks! Updated to 3 stars, only because the device still randomly connects/disconnects when in range. Updating firmware isn’t very clear either.——-Using a Series 8 Apple Watch, and 2023 NordicTrack 2450, and hoped this device would bridge that gap, as advertised.  And it does - when you can get it connected.  I've often had to spend 10-15 minutes unplugging/plugging it back in, restarting my Apple Watch, turning Bluetooth on/off...everything I could think of.  Sometimes it will finally connect, other times I just give up.One additional issue - if you move outside of the range after finishing your workout, and you haven't 'ended' the exercise and saved your data, you will lose it.  So basically, the developers have left a hole in the app that guarantees data loss, and that's just awful.Not aware of any alternatives, unfortunately, but I would save your money until something better comes along."", ""It has worked well for the first 4 months.

This watch is a massive improvement in health and fitness tracking and accuracy, and I have no concerns about a touchscreen failing and falling off from the glue softening.The button controls are intuitive and make sense; I don't think I'd ever go back to a touchscreen watch again. Whether the screen is covered in water or sweat, it still works every time. The amount of fitness tracking features Garmin has is much better. My heartrate is more accurate, and it gives you better sleep data, as well as your HRV, which Samsung doesn't give you at all. Garmin Connect is great for plotting cycling routes, and the GPS data is spot on in most cases.My #1 gripe about Garmin is that you can't record a ride from the cell phone app, you have to use a Garmin device.

The data generated also has helped me see what I did when one takes me by surprise. The watch gives me a suggested workout every day, which I follow.

I would recommend syncing the watch with your phone at least every hour, to be safe.-- The call alert function of the watch alerts you to a call, but it doesn't let you dismiss a call or answer it (say, if you have earbuds in).If the syncing worked better, I would say this would *easily* outclass a Fitbit Charge 5 (except for answering or dismissing calls).  The GPS is much more accurate, there are more exercises, and it gives you more features for the money.  But I would say this does work *better* than the Charge 5 in the GPS function, and if they could fix the software, this would be an easy recommendation."", 'Si lo que buscas es un smartwatch barato, de una marca reconocida, que te notifique los MSM, WhatsApp, correos, llamadas, registre tu ubicación, monitoreé tu sueño y funciones vitales aceptablemente y no deseas pagar 300 o 400 dólares por un smartwatch; este es el indicado.Fueron muchos los comentarios negativos que leí sobre este reloj pero debo decir que hasta ahora cumplió mis expectativas salvo algunos detalles menores.Muchos de esos comentarios negativos fueron especialmente sobre la conectividad y la sincronización con la app, se perdían las notificaciones de MMS, WhatsApp y llamadas; yo tengo un Galaxy S21 Plus y no he tenido mayores problemas al respecto, como todo aparato vinculado al Bluetooth si te alejas demasiado la conectividad se pierde pero este se vincula nuevamente cuando te acercas al dispositivo; con la última actualización de la app se ha corregido bastante las fallas de notificaciones.Desafortunadamente también con la última actualización el reloj ya no tiene la función de control de música, aunque a decir verdad nunca me funcionó.Si bien el anuncio dice que la durabilidad de la batería puede llegar hasta los 14 días, no creo que sea tan así; en mi caso lo he tenido que cargar cada 5 días, que en mi parecer es bastante.Hasta la fecha he preferido no arriesgar en meterlo al agua así que no sé si realmente es resistente al agua.Otra de las razones porque compré este smartwatch fueron sus 26 modos de deporte, especialmente el de fútbol; aquí si me ha decepcionado porque no registra la distancia más si el tiempo y las calorías quemadas; lo probé en modo Hike y en este caso si registró la distancia y la ubicación, supongo que debe mejorar la actualización del app.El registro de sueño, ritmo cardíaco, saturacion de oxígeno, pasos son bastante aceptables.', 'El reloj es bonito, muy bueno y tiene buenas funciones, sin embargo me llamó la atencion que la descripcion del producto dice que la bateria dura ""hasta 14 dias"" pero solamente la primera carga duró mas o menos 6 dias, de ahi en adelante la carga le está durando entre 1 o 2 dias maximo, para poder usar el reloj ahora debo cargarlo todos los dias.', ""It's a good watch too bad you have too be online for the app and watch too work together"", 'This watch replaces a Pebble Steel that has been in use since 2016. After six years the battery in the Pebble Steel is waning. The main features I was looking for were similar water resistance, at least one week of battery life and phone media control. As for the later, the Moto 100 only provides media controls for play/pause, previous and next. The Moto Watch does not show active media from the connected mobile device. The Pebble Steel does the later as well as providing volume control. The Amazon listing for the Moto 100 says it will skip tracks or turn up the volume without needing easy access to your phone. This statement is inaccurate.The aluminum case and overall build quality appear quite nice. The battery life is about one week and it charges in about an hour.The PulseOx measurement system is inaccurate in a hypoxemia situation [holding your breath; pulse ox <= 90 %] when the watch reading is compared to a conventional finger style pulse ox device. The Wyze Watch 47 watch has the same deficiency.Here are several other noteworthy items.The magnetic coupling of the charging cable to the watch should be stronger. The cable easily becomes detached if the watch is moved. The cable will not stay connected under its own weight.Unlike the Pebble Steel, the stopwatch will quit timing if one leaves the screen to do something else. The same holds true for the timers.The 10 second duration of the vibration related to the alarm functionality isn’t long enough to wake me up.The short, usually one word or partial word notifications, for example from emails, provided on large LCD touch screen isn’t detailed enough to be readily identifiable.After six weeks of use, the lights associated with the heart rate and PulseOx measurements quit. As a result, the related dynamic health functions fail to work. The next day the watch failed completely and no longer powers up. The product has a two-year warranty. See the photo for the likely culprit.The Motowatch support team requests numerous “quick” videos related to the watch functionality when simple photos suffice. There is nothing quick about the process of sending a 25 MB, 10 second video, [link] via email! The support team should be more considerate of the customers’ time.After more than a week of answering emails from Motowatch and providing needless videos, the watch was replaced by eBuyNow LTD. The replacement lacks any ability to control media playback on the connected smartphone. It’s also worth noting that the magnetic attraction between the charging cable and the watch is much better on the replacement compared to the watch originally received. It’s unclear why there is such variability between presumably identical products.I ultimately received a RMA and returned the product. It took weeks and additional emails before I finally received the promised refund from eBuyNow LTD via PayPal. During this process, eBuyNow LTD customer support claimed more than once being overwhelmed with “logistical problems”. Overall, this entire experience with the seller was very frustrating and time consuming.I went on to purchase an Amazefit GTR 3 Pro LTD which has an OS like the Moto 100, only far better implemented. Except for the PulseOx accuracy, it has none of the faults noted here of the Moto 100.', 'I like the looks and quality of the watch. I wish there was an option for a larger time display. Hard for me to read without my glasses.', 'Just like everybody else mine came with no instruction booklet. There was nothing anywhere in any of the reviews as well as the description of the product that stated it did not have a microphone or speaker in it and the only form of notifications are buzzing vibration. Speaking of that it vibrates over every single thing by default and I was very cautious when originally setting up what apps could interact with this device. So now I have $100 piece of unbreakable junk and a bunch of screen protectors for a watch that I\'m going to send back after waiting a week to get. I\'m sure that this is a much higher standard than any of those Chinese pieces of junk out there that for under $20 but I expected so much more from a device that already has the tech built into it and just needs a microphone and a speaker. I like all the other features on it and this would probably be perfect for somebody who\'s just starting out with a wearable tech peace. But they need to revamp their description and product. When there\'s this many options on a phone you expect that it has a printed instruction booklet with it but I got nothing but a QR code and a quick start guide. Also the recharging ""cradle"" is a magnetic plug that doesn\'t fit anything else and is not a standard micro USB. Consider these things before you spend your money on this purchase.']"

SpO2, steps climb, and a working touch screen. Polar flow definitely need a radical changes, it's old, but Polar is too afraid to disrupt its software."", 'Ich hatte bereits früher die Polar Vantage M2, die Grit X Pro war somit ein wirklich grandioses Upgrade für mich.Die Uhr sieht nicht nur sehr stylish aus, sie überzeugt mich jeden Tag erneut mit ihren umfangreichen Messdaten und Angaben. Verbessert wurde auch das Sync-Verhalten, hier hatte die Vantage M2 öfter einmal das Problem, dass die Verbindung zum Handy und der App erst nach einigen erneuten Versuchen aufgebaut wurde. Die Grit X Pro hingegen verbindet sich extrem zuverlässig.Viele beschweren sich ja, dass das Display nicht hell genug sei. Hierüber kann man streiten, ich finde die Display-Technik von Polar ziemlich gelungen und die Anzeige ist wirklich auch in allen Lichtsituationen hervorragend zu lesen (insbesondere auch, wenn es sehr hell ist. Viele übersehen hierbei, dass ""by Design"" es sich nicht um OLED-Display wie in anderen Smartwatches handelt. Vielmehr funktioniert das ganze so, dass die Hintergrundbeleuchtung nur in sehr dunklen Umgebungen sich einschaltet (die Grit X Pro hat hierbei zwei Modi, ein ""gedimmtes"" Backlight beim Drehen der Uhr am Arm, ausreichend in den meisten dunkleren Umgebungen, sowie ein helleres Backlight auf Knopfdruck). Der Vorteil dieser Technik bemerkt man spätestens an der Akkulaufzeit, hier saugen gewöhnlichere OLED-Varianten definitiv schneller den Akku leer.Die Sensorik finde ich überragend, sowohl was die Vital-Funktionen betrifft, aber die Magnetometer für Kompass sowie GPS (plus noch Galileo & Glonass). Dass die Ortung ungenau sei, wie mache sagen, kann ich definitiv nicht bestätigen.Die Polar Flow App ist ein wenig ""naja"", aber sie tut ihren Dienst. Die Integration jedoch mit Strava sowie vor allem Komoot ist jedoch absolut perfekt. Geplante Routen in Komoot erscheinen fehlerfrei in der Flow-App, hier kann nun ausgewählt werden, welche geplante Route man auf die Uhr übertragen möchte. Sobald synchronisiert, kann es auch ohne das Handy los gehen. Super praktisch auch die Back to Start Funktion, die auch jederzeit ohne vorherige Planung einer Route gut und zuverlässig klappt.Die Kalibrierung des Kompass / Höhenmessers ist ein wenig umständlich, man wird jedoch ganz gut von der Uhr durch den Prozess geführt. Am besten sollte man sich daür auf ein freies Terrain stellen, so dass die Uhr so viele Satelliten wie möglich gleichzeitig erfassen kann. Auch sollte man bei der Kalibrierung nicht unbedingt in der nähe von Hochspannungsleitungen stehen, dies stört natürlich ganz klar die Magnetometer.Insgesamt: klare Kaufempfehlung für alle, die Outdoor sehr aktiv sind!', 'I have had all the major sport smart watches and this by far my favorite. It looks great, is very durable and the Polar mobile app is excellent. It is also just as comfortable to wear as how great it looks. It is difficult to find a sport watch that checks all of these boxes. Is also very affordable compared to comparable fitness watches. The watch and application accurately and simply track all your activities, sleep and get timely notifications from your watch. The copper watch color and brown band are unique. The copper color is not to flashy, but cool enough to stand out from boring watch colors. I use it daily to log my walk and runs. I only take it off to give me wrist some breathing room every day or two and to charge. I will be long-time Polar customer because their products are only getting better and better.', 'Eine wunderschöne Uhr. Gleich mal zu Beginn, ich nutze die Uhr für Ultramarathons, eigentlich nur nur zum Aufzeichnen der Strecke, sowie die Schlafüberwachung. Beides macht sie sehr gut. Heute war ich 11.30h im GPS Modus unterwegs, links die Polar hatte noch 75% Restladung, rechts die Forerunner 945 hatte auch gute 62% Restladung. Die Ablesbarkeit der Uhr Outdoor ist sehr gut, fürs Studio machen andere das besser. Das einzige was die Garmin besser macht, die Stop/Start Automatik im Training, die Polar stoppt beim kürzesten Stillstand, startet aber nicht mehr von alleine.', 'Molto funzionale ed elegante .', 'Nach längerer Entscheidungsfindung bei der Wahl einer neuen Sportuhr bin ich letztlich bei der Polar in der Nordic Copper-Version gelandet. Die Uhr sieht wertig aus, ist gut verarbeitet, die Knöpfe an der Seite lassen sich auch mit Handschuhen gut finden und der Druckpunkt ist gut definiert. Der Tragekomfort ist sehr gut, das Standard-Armband ist flexibel und lässt sich am Handgelenk gut fixieren und trägt sich dann auch unauffällig. Der Touchscreen hingegen ist das bisher einzige für mich relevante Manko. Es reagiert oftmals sehr träge und nicht selten muss der Touch mehrfach erfolgen bis eine gewünschte Reaktion erfolgt. Hier bin ich aber von meiner Apple Watch verwöhnt worden. Da aber alle Funktionen auch auf Knopfdruck funktionieren und ich gern ""old-school"" unterwegs bin, stört es mich tatsächlich weniger. Positiver, weil täglich spür- und messbar ist für mich die Akku-Leistung. Meine Apple Watch muss täglich ans Kabel, die Polar kommt bei meiner normalen Nutzung durchaus 5-6 Tage ohne Aufladung aus.Die anderweitig bereits mehrfach beschriebenen Probleme mit der Höhenmessung oder Schrittzählung auf dem Rad bestehen weiterhin und sind alles andere als schön.Insgesamt gefällt mir die Polar Grit X Pro sehr gut, ich bereue die Entscheidung für diese Uhr zu keinem Zeitpunkt. Einen Stern muss ich wegen der beschriebenen Probleme dennoch abziehen.', 'Zum Radfahren', 'Era da un bel po’ che lo desideravo così ho approfittato di una super offerta sull’amazon warehouse (articoli usati) e me lo sono regalato per Natale per sostituire il mio Polar M400. L’orologio è perfetto non ha alcun segno visibile solo qualche graffio nei punti di contatto con la base di ricarica nella parte inferiore (ho scelto uno che non avesse segni sulla parte anteriore e devo dire che la descrizione era veritiera ) e funziona alla perfezione.Unica nota curiosa, comunque evidenziata nella descrizione anche se in maniera “sibillina” è la totale mancanza del cinturino, cosa che ad un primo momento lascia spiazzati ma perfettamente comprensibile in un’ottica di qualità e igiene: il cinturino o non è mai stato indossato oppure è meglio metterlo nuovo.!!!Ho acquistato quello originale e con una spesa comunque contenuta ho avuto il mio Grit X pro!A livello di funzioni ne ha fin troppe!!!Molte legate al benessere fisico e parecchie legate all’uso outdoor.Ovviamente è uno sportwatch dove la parte smart è ridotta all’osso e francamente quando pratico attività sportiva non ho alcun interesse ad avere notifiche o ascoltare musica, poi ognuno fa come preferisce.L’abitudine ai menù e al mondo Polar mi ha aiutato tra le varie schermate e sotto menù, bisogna perderci qualche minuto per settarlo e/o modificare alcune cose tramite app ma a me piace anche per questo!Non è proprio piccolo ma una volta indossato non sembra di averlo al polso. Per avere una rilevazione cardiaca dal polso più realistica bisogna indossarlo in un modo per me inusuale (stretto e un po’ più in dietro del solito) ma ci si abitua.Provato anche a collegarlo con una fascia cardio Polar H7 non ha avuto alcun problema. Retroilluminazione regolabile e sufficiente.I tasti fisici sono comodi anche con i guanti.', 'Tenia el GRIT X, Y ahora la versión pro.Para mí es el mejor reloj para hacer deporte, por su exactitud, tanto de GPS como pulsómetro, por su resistencia, por los modos, y por la app de Polar.', ""I love polar, like this watch a lot.

The following review is largely in comparison to the 2018 Ticwatch Pro.Pros:- SpO2 sensor is a novel and useful addition and the main reason to upgrade from the 2018 model. Be aware that it uses reflective-mode pulse oximetry which is not clinically accurate.- Snapdragon Wear 4100 fixes the abysmal responsiveness lag of the earlier Snapdragon Wear 2100 for both UI and Google Assistant, but it\'s still not as responsive as a typical phone.- Slightly thinner body than previous Ticwatch Pro, which was massive and barely fit under most shirt cuffs- Lighter weight and generally more comfortable- ""Essential mode"" LCD now has a backlight- Battery life so far has been greatCons:- Previous model metal body and rear cover are now made of plastic- Previous leather-covered silicone strap is now fully silicone- Charging cable no longer includes data pins for debugging (ADB) and it doesn\'t seem like a third-party cable with data pins exists at this time.

No skin rashes. As per the title, the biggest plus point for me is that I have not had any rashes on my wrist thus far. I live in the tropics, where high humidity is the norm and as a westerner from cold northern Europe I sweat a lot here. I tried 2 different Fitbits before and both caused rashes around my wrist within days of wearing them. Note that I\'ve been wearing a Casio for years without issues. I\'ve been wearing the Instinct Solar during workouts, on the beach in the scorching hot sun, in the swimming pool, on entire days where I\'m out and about with the kids and drenched, and no issues. When home, I usually take it off, wash it and turn on battery saver when not wearing it. At night, I wear it on my other wrist, which is more mental and to give my dominant wrist some ""air"". So for those with skin sensitivity, do try it out. I was very worried about this and still am a bit, but so far so good (few weeks in).2. Battery life. As said, what I do is, when I wear it, battery saver is off, when not it\'ll be on. During exercise GPS will be used so the battery drains a bit more, but so far I\'ve only charged it once since purchase a few weeks ago. I wear it at night, too, to measure my sleep and resting HR.3. Simplicity. For those who fancy touch screens, this is not it. Going from an old Casio this is already a big jump for me, and big enough for my needs. You can find all the basic information you need at the press of a button. See the images for reference.4. Size. For Western standards I have relatively small wrists. I wore a Casio GWM5610 Solar for years, which will continue to last me a lifetime, and I don\'t feel the Garmin Instinct is much bigger (you can compare them online).5. Solar. I like the idea of solar. But this is not a necessity. For me it\'s because I\'m used to the Casio solar and because I do intend to go trekking/hiking. So it\'s more the ""what-if"" in my mind. For those on a tight budget, however, I think the non-solar Instinct will serve you just as great. When I charged it the first time and had it on battery saver mode it indicated 111 days of battery life. How real that is I don\'t know, but I figure you can go a long way even without solar energy.6. Durability. Not tested in its entirety, but I accidentally slammed it into metal objects a few times and it seems intact from the impact. It seemingly is designed for rough conditions, so I don\'t doubt it will endure like my Casio does.', 'Very disappointed with this product. It was a replacement for my Garmin Instinct which I had for 5 years. The saving grace was the fast delivery and no fuss refund.', 'I have been looking at this watch for almost a month. Garmin sells this at $629. Shopee around $569-579 or $400++ for chinese version from Taiwan. Carousell cheapest at $530.When I saw it at almost 45% discount on Amazon, thought it is a scam. Just pay the $348 and hope for the best.Thanks Amazon for letting buy this solar instinct so cheap!This is my upgrade from Fitbit charge 3. Alot of functions and sensors plus GPS built-in. Very happy with my purchase.', '3 days in and already have to charge it after being fully charged on the day of delivery.Only used it for 10hrs of ""excercise"" and it ate up the battery quickly.Better of paying under $300 for the non solar watch.It also looses its location and placed me 3km away on another track when other other garmin uses had no issues.', 'Nice sturdy watch. GPS and all sensors are accurate. Minimal customisations are available. Charging is slow. Takes 2 hrs.Solar works but its very slow to charge. Does not sync with google fit. But that us more of an app issue.', 'Works as intended. Battery life longer then expected especially if you walk during sunny periods.', 'I love the way the case has been designed and built.Easiest watch I have had, to be able to swap out the band, in seconds.The materials used in the watch are damn good.Except for the charge , I don’t have any real cons on this watch. Charge doesn’t stay more than 4 days. But that’s also cos all the sensors are kept always on.Works seamless with the garmin app too.Although after using for a few months I’m a little bored of the watch face and the mono display! But the watch is primarily an absolute outdoor activities watch.', 'I needed a fitness tracker which could monitor the parameters through the day along with expedition ready features. Let me tell you this watch is full of sensors. It is rugged and takes on all types of abuses. I have been using it for few days and found it to be too accurate. Battery life is decent if you are not using all the sensors all the time. It charges on solar power as well and it’s pretty decent. The features in this watch include GPS receiver, compass, barometer, altimeter, accelerometer, gps based weather updates, smart phone connectivity heart rate monitor, spo2 monitor, stress monitor, pedometer. All these sensors keeps on monitoring ur parameters and finally gets updated on beautiful app of garmin connect. Which collates ur data and tells u about the sleep cycle, stress levels, heart rate etc. charging should be done with 1 Ah charger only. It doesn’t have the bells and whistles of a smart watch rather it’s a watch with sensors and accurate monitoring. It’s more of expedition and activity tracker. It has basic features of smart phone connectivity however it’s doesn’t have touch screen and doesn’t have full controls of smart phone. It is ideal for someone whose looking for a watch with good sensors and basic functionality of a smart watch. Good for fitness freaks, expedition lovers, aviators, someone whose looking to track own health. Looks are decent. The straps are of premium quality and can be worn throughout the day without any issues. Battery life is 24 days if using pedometer and  heart rate sensor. As the usage increases, the battery will drain faster. Solar charging helps in reducing the rate of battery drain and even charges it up if kept in full intensity. One needs to do setup of the watch to optimise battery life. In nutshell, if you are buying a garmin, you will get accuracy, it’s their forte. This watch is value for money. Not for ones who want full controls of smart phone through the watch. No touch screen or coloured display.', ""It's a super rugged, comfortable to wear all day smart watch. Doesn't have ton of smart options, but the things it does, it's quite accurate. GPS navigation is very helpful for hikes and treks. Then the pulse o2 meters, heart rate monitors & ABC comes very handy in long trips. Battery life is awesome (if you are mostly outdoors). I charged it before the trip. It lasted around a month..."", 'Worth the price , excellent watch for outdoors .']"

Doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of other Garmin watches or competitor products, but if you need an effective and reliable GPS watch for military use, this can’t be beat.', 'AmazonI was looking to replace an old Fitbit charge watch, and came across Garmin during my search. I could see from the vast array of Garmin watches that the “Fenix” range was probably the best combination of aesthetic features and tech that I wanted, but the price range $1200+ was just way out of the budget. So I opted for the seemingly popular original  “Instinct” model - however chose to get the upgraded Solar tactical, as 1. It was a true black colour and not graphite grey, and 2. The solar feature seemed like it would be beneficial. 3. The tactical model was on sale here on Amazon for only $460, down from $750, so of course went with that over the base $250 model.Have to say, the watch does have that tough guy, chunky masculine outdoorsy look about it, and that appealed to me over say, an Apple watch. I am a bigger muscled guy with well developed forearms so the watch sat quite nicely on my wrist, but IMO it would look way too big and disproportionate on slim, small wristed runner types.A couple of people I know asked me as a joke if I was wearing a parole tracker tag on my wrist - so even on my big frame it was noticeably large/high off the arm for a watch. I think the large face, and the slim band only highlights this further.The watch is a pain in the arse to set up and work out how to use. The menus are convoluted and confusing to navigate and it will take a significant amount of trial and error and patience to learn how to use it swiftly and to make use of all the features. Especially after living in a intuitive touch world of user friendly Apple and Samsung products etcI found myself avoiding doing things with the watch that I wanted it do, as it lacks any form of touch screen and the button navigation just feels dated and plain annoying.I specifically think the solar feature is useless as others have mentioned, it takes way to long to charge in the sun and most folks would not be getting enough constant sun to see significant charging benefits (for how much extra a solar model costs in any Garmin watch compared to a non solar model) - the tactical model of this watch is literally pointless if you are not actually some kind of commando or army related person - I ended up deleting the Stealth and Combat Nighmode off the watch menu, same goes for the parachuting feature. Annoyingly you can’t get rid of the stealth symbol off the main watch face and so could only see a battery health logo as a symbol, with no numerical value or percentage, as the stealth symbol is locked and takes up that space.Can’t stress enough that if you are not someone who daily/weekly does army related stuff, there is zero need to get a tactical version, and I might even argue that for those people there is way better Garmin choices (with touch screen features) or other watch brands which are better.Overall I was extremely underwhelmed and even irritated by the watch. I can’t for the life of me understand why or how it can be worth so much money (the tactical and solar model) for such basic rudimentary technology.Also to note, the actual useable screen size is minuscule (less than 2cmx2cm) compared to the overall size of the bezel, watch face, side and height - it just makes no sense why it is so chunky for such a basic tiny display watch. Even though I like the chunky overall size, there is just no need for it to be so big when the screen is pathetically small. It makes it feel a bit like a novelty costume watch.The app that it comes with, is good. And it tracks and displays data well, and when you are on the app you are reminded of the fact that it IS in-fact a smart watch, as nothing about using the watch itself feels “smart” or “techy” or “convenient” on a daily basis.If you are someone who genuinely is going to use all the trekking features daily or weekly, or use this watch only on certain outdoor adventures - then I can see how the base (non solar, non tactical model) might be a useful watch to have.But if like me, you are daily wearer, gym bro, who likes to track normal smart watch things like heart rate, sleep quality, and steps, but with a chunky watch look - it’s really not the right choice IMO. There are just way better choices for a daily smart watch,  a lot with way better usability and features for the daily commute, work day and gym.I would consider trying out a Garmin Fenix 6 or 7, as I haven’t given up on Garmin specifically, as those seem more like a proper touch screen smart watch with the features you get on an Apple Watch but with the chunkier, masculine look.I have gone back to my smaller Fitbit charge 5, and even though it looks like a tiny bracelet on me, I instantly felt relieved and was so much happier with the convenience and ease of use as soon as I put it back on. But the Fenix is now in my sights', ""This watch is pretty good. Its lightweight, rugged and honestly its so reliably boring that you forget it's on your wrist. The GPS function keeps time accurate no matter where you go but it sucks the battery life down from 30+ days on watch mode to one day if it's in constant GPS use, same with the compass. MGRS is accurate to your 10 digit so no worries there. Dive rated to 300' or so, so you don't have to worry about taking it off to get a little wet. Solar feature is cool concept, but I have yet to see it make a difference in battery life, so I don't think the technology has gotten to the point where the watch has unlimited life on solar. I got this watch so I can disconnect from my phone addiction, so I can't vouch for any integrated health or sleep apps. The heart rate monitor seems to read a bit higher than actual heart rate but it gets the job done. All in all it's a great watch that tells time and has some nice additional features for MIL, LEO, Maritime professionals or outdoorsman & women."", ""I haven't had this watch for long but already I have no complaints. I do outdoor general construction including concrete form work and this is the only watch I can trust to not break on me. The all rubber wrist band is nice as it'll break when it needs to and I don't have to worry about de-gloving. It is in fact waterproof so far, I spent half an hour cleaning out a storm drain and got mud and water all over but as soon as I got home I threw it in the sink and scrubbed it off. The battery life is wonderful and the interface is easy to use and understand. There are so many great features and the GPS is incredibly accurate to my surprise. If I come across any issues later I'll update this review but with first impressions I have no qualms or issues. 10/10Update: 2 months later and as you can see in the second picture it's still going strong. There's slight wear and probably dirt as well on the keepers (which hold the strap flawlessly) and a small knick out of the plastic between the Menu and ABC button. I roughly dragged my hand across hardened concrete that was still stuck to one of the steel forms at work and it just took the slightest chunk out of the outer bezel if you'd call it that. No scratches to the glass no water damage, the battery life isn't affected by the cold even when it got down to the single digits, I never have to worry about this watch. It's also amazing how it can pick up sunlight on a cloudy winter day. The only thing I've noticed is the heart rate tracker seems to have issues accurately tracking my pulse as of lately but I'm not sure if thats mechanical or human error. I do know my heart rate didn't drop down to 48 BPM while stacking lumber though. Still havent used the GPS yet but i have used the compass to find north on New job sites. Overall still an amazing watch and well worth the price especially if you're out in the field every day."", ""You name it, this watch does it.  Fitness tracker, smart watch, navigation aid, watch with world time, and the list goes on.  It will even track your sleep patterns with movement, HR, and pulse ox measurements.I considered a traditional smart watch and fitness trackers in my search for wearable tech.  I really liked the way the Garmin looked vs the other basic square designs.  I had prior experience with a Forerunner so I knew that their Connect service would track the activities I wanted to, so I gave it a go.A couple months in, I am really happy with this device.  Be prepared to potentially frustrate yourself with all of the button combinations and settings available in the watch.  There are additional settings in the Connect app that affect the watch or the app and sometimes are not clear due to terminology overload.I'm not outside enough these days to get the solar energy required to keep the watch charged without plugging it in.  Currently, I get 5 to 6 days before I plug the watch into the included USB cable and let it charge overnight.  With all the smart functions turned off, it will go months between charges.  I don't think anything will beat my old solar G-Shock though.  It still reports a full charge but hasn't been outside in a year.  Of course, it doesn't do anything other than tell time and set itself from the atomic clock.I've had two glitches that required a restart.  The first was after getting everything set up, the watch would not chime at mile markers on runs.  The second was after being in operation for about a month with daily running, walking, and biking, it was behaving a little strangly (randomly pausing on a run) and a restart cleared that.The Connect app is awesome.  The one thing I wish it had is data sharing with Peloton - I manually add my ride metrics into the app after I'm done.  I may try to do some work with the two vendors' APIs to see if I can automate that part of it."", 'The description of this watch led me to believe it was the instinct 2 tactical, instead it was the first version. The watch is great Garmin quality just not what I was after especially since I believed I was upgrading from my current instinct 1 watch.', 'I wanted a rugged, smart watch with excellent battery life and this is it.If you want a fancy, colorful, touch screen, this isn’t the watch for you. But if you want a lightweight, rugged, smart watch, that gets out of your way, but has almost a month of battery life, the Garmin Instinct Solar Tactical is it.I wanted it primarily for heart rate monitoring, SPO2, GPS, Compass and NAV features as well as altimeter and barometer. The only feature I wish it had was VO2 Max calculation, but maybe a subsequent version will.By default, it can pair with your phone and it does have alerts that integrate with your phone, but I didn’t want my wrist buzzing every time I got a text message, email, calendar reminder, etc, so I disabled those.First, I wanted a solid, rugged watch, and this delivers. It’s not as bulky as the G-Shocks which I’ve had in the past. It’s monochrome interface is perfect for someone who wants utility over looks. The menus are easy enough to master. You can still customize the watch face and menu order to bring the widgets most important to you front and center.My favorite watch thus far. If they add VO2 Max, it will be just about perfect.', 'I’ve been holding out to buy a good “workout/fit bit” type smart watch for a while.  I will always be happy to wear an old fashion watch, but I have come to enjoy so far the information and practicality of this watch.I’ve had it for a week, and so far it’s been pretty cool.I definitely paid overpriced for what I would probably use it for.  But the functions are good to help keep a person like myself interested in achieving goals through the day that can progress into more achievable workouts - and one day be able to suit up for the Avengers!The downsides is that the watch is not touch screen (which I was hoping for), trying to figure out how to understand the functions or the apps at times can be frustrating with the lack of information to explain them.  When setting it up from start, it was frustrating that I accidentally hit a button too fast, but couldn’t go back to correct it.  So now the information is incorrect.I’d prefer a better strap, but over all it does the job.If you want something like this, I would recommend waiting for a sale.  But over all Garmin has been a good name brand that you can rely on.', 'Looks like a great watch, just hard to figure easiest functions']"

Working in park maintenance, I’m usually outdoors with chainsaws, hand tools, and small and heavy equipment. Subsequently, I wanted something rugged enough to be a work accessory, and versatile enough to integrate tech into something as fundamental as a watch; this Garmin does all of that.The biggest features I use are the weather and sunset time widgets, as my work on the job site and at home on my farm are dependent on these conditions, and being able to glance on the fly helps me adapt my schedule in real time. Having this information on my wrist means I can access it easily without having to dig out my phone while sitting in a Bobcat or Excavator, or fishing underneath my chainsaw chaps. The most handy feature by far, however, is the Area Calculator, which uses GPS to measure job sites and determine how much fertilizer and seed I need to order, and it really helps me stay on top of planning and budgeting.The Alarm also keeps me on schedule, as the vibration and sound combo wakes me up before dawn better than any other watch I’ve owned. Being able to set recurring alarms from the app on my phone also makes this a breeze, as I can adjust my daily wake-up time, and also go back to analyze how much sleep I’ve gotten throughout the week.I’ve had the Garmin Instinct Tactical for a month and a half now, and only had to fully charge it twice (other than when I topped it off to 100% when it arrived). I suspect I will need to charge it less during the summer months when I’m out in direct sunlight more, given the solar charging capability. I also feel naked without it on my wrist, as It’s become so invaluable I rarely take it off. I’ve added aftermarket protection in the way of a “screen protector” over the face and a rubberized ring around the outside of the case; so far even flush cutting stumps and digging through the mud hasn’t so much as required a quick wipe down to look as good as new.If anything changes, I’ll update this review, but for me this watch is perfect, and the price was great. I can’t recommend it enough!', 'I like the durability and functionality the watch has to offer, particularly how the watch doesn\'t need the phone to operate. There are some settings that should be changeable like the date and time without the need for a phone. This should be added.I do feel that this watch was more out of the box ready than most. As someone who likes to know which way is North as any given time this watch made a huge difference. Also, because the buttons are well sealed, I never have to worry about saltwater damage. The biggest reason I went with this watch was the solar charging and yes it does work. Though unless you spend more than 5 hours in the sun a day you won\'t notice the difference as easily.One factor that made me happy was the attention to detail with the band strap, on most cheaper watches you tend to lose the little ""organizers"" used to keep the strap neat when in use, this watch doesn\'t let them slip off and comes with 2!For a cheaper watch I am happy with this purchase, I do wish the newer version was cheaper so that I could do a comparison but overall, I am quite happy with this.', 'This watch is awesome, i wear it everyday!Garmin always seems to live up to their name.Tough and rugged, battery life is amazing.Charge it once a week, maybe.I am not easy on it either, always outside, wrenching on vehicle and other mechanical things.At first it gave me a sweat rash, but i cleaned it with a special soap and it went away.It also froze up once when i was tracking my fitness, did a hard reboot and a system update, never happed again.', ""I've had a garmin for the past few years and I couldn't be happier with my upgrade. It works well and the battery life is top notch especially if you're outside all day. I use it all the time and when I'm in the field for a week the battery is never an issue"", 'There’s a lot to love about this watch and little to dislike, but some aspects can be kind of niche. Fortunately for me, this watch is exactly everything I was looking for.I was in the market for essentially a Casio protrek that could show me messages/notifications from my phone.Simple request but not easily filled. The combination of smart watch and solar powered (or augmented in this case) only features a limited number of watches on the market that are worth buying.My second demand was that the watch be rugged. I’m very hard on clothes, jackets, shoes and accessories. I need to know my watch won’t fail if I accidentally hit it with a hammer or crack it off a metal door while loading something into the truck.The additional functionality of this watch is also very much appreciated. Pulse, 02, GPS tracking, weather, moon phases (which will come in handy during telescope season), the calendar is also great. I subscribe to a Google cal that shows me my sports team’s schedule, that’s the only calendar I have in Apple calendar, as such it’s the only event on my watch face, meaning I’m never losing track of what time the baseball game is. Sounds silly but it’s saved me sooo many trips into my phone, which was all I’d hoped to avoid with the Messages and Notifications function. And it works perfectly.I can be in the middle of a task, with gloves on and oil on my hands, and my wife could reply back to me from a text chain an hour old. If she texts me, I have to look at it. Before this meant removing my gloves, taking out my phone and reading it, just to see her message “ok” and now I’m on my phone, so I’m checking email and being distracted.Can I reply to texts on this watch? No! And that’s exactly what I wanted. Just info, immediately, no lag like on Apple Watch, no temptation to reply or get distracted.The battery life is supreme, especially if you use any of the various power saving modes. When I had an Apple Watch I absolutely hated the requirement to charge it. I hated needing to remember to do something. This watch isn’t another chore, it’s a wonderfully freeing watch experience for someone who is busy, on the go, in the dirt, and needing a trustworthy wrist companion that deals out the info you need without the distraction or temptation of Uber smart watches which in my opinion, do too much.', ""Chose this route for a GPS after some careful consideration, and a buddies recommendation. I will never turn back! First off the main reason I choose this was due to the fact that I needed a new GPS after my old one broke. The biggest reason I had was, I new I would carry my phone with me even if I handheld GPS. The watch is supported by 2 main apps the Connect app and the Explore app. the explore app lets me use topo maps and everything a handheld gps has, or I can set points in it and have the watch take me on the trail. I use the watch a lot to track my hikes and to geocache. I like that it lets me track fishing as well and mark spots with time and weather conditions as well when I get a fish. The only big thing I wish it had was a way to track Motorized rides effectively, I currently just use the bike widget but I don't need the health info when I'm on my motorcycle or 4 wheeler."", ""Loved my original garmin instinct for tracking outdoor activities but the battery just wasn't lasting as long as I would have liked. This battery easily last 3x that and with solar charging will last even longer. It's been winter here so I haven't worn the clothing that would put the solar charging to the test yet, will update once I've had a chance to use that feature more."", 'Régions hors connexion', 'After ~4 months I\'d probably return this is I still could. The watch is nice, tons of features I don\'t and probably will never use.The main complaint of this watch is the charging. It uses a port of the bottom so you have to take it off to charge. It also uses a weird usb cord that if you misplace the watch is useless.Garmin should use a standard port or include 3-4 of the cords with a $300+ watch (one for car, home, work, backpack?). Also I\'d encourage them to make the cords a bright color so it\'s easier to differentiate from others.If Garmin engineers are reading, I\'d suggest a charging port somewhere you can plug it in when wearing - this way I can have it attached to a power bank in my pocket/bag. Also if this could have been made to use a wireless charger seems more ideal.Finally when the watch is working - I use the heart rate monitor and it seems accurate. The feature I use the most is the ""Find my Phone"" and that\'s been very helpful.', ""Not much to say other than if you know what this is, and its features are useful to what you are doing, then it's worth the money. Everything you need, nothing you don't. Like any good tool in the tool box, it just works as it should, and is a solid piece in all conditions so far. The Solar actually works really really well, and I plug it in maybe once a month for a couple hours. I wear it daily, generally 24 hours a day. So if you are on the fence with the price, you won't be disappointed. It is legit worth it.""]"

No big deal, since the seller provided two. But after 5 weeks, the watch stopped charging altogether. It was dead. My son was devastated, he really loved this watch. It gave him a good bit of independence without any distracting apps. He was able to call us, but we had to video call or chat using data in order to reach him. It\'s also important to know that one has to pay a fee in order to get rid of the ads in the parent app.Amazon went above and beyond and refunded the purchase even though the watch broke just outside the 4 week return period.We tried to convince our son to buy a more expensive watch that would last longer, but he really liked this one.So we re-bought the same model. Interestingly, calls now went through both ways (same sim card as before). We also bought an extended warranty given how poorly we fared with the first watch. Alas, the power button on the side of the new watch fell out in the very first day our son wore it. He loves this watch so much that he wants to keep using it with a pin or a needle to work that button. Sadly, it really needs to go back.So: it\'s remarkable that one can buy something like this for $80 (or maybe even less), but be prepared for it to break.In summary: Amazon 5 stars. Phtech 1 starFollow-up (updated): The watch stopped charging after 5 months. The manufacturer website provides an email address for ""contact customer support"", but nobody responded to our emails about the broken watch, which was clearly within the warranty period. The manufacturer responded to our claim through Amazon by sending an email address embedded in a word doc (why?) that initially could not be opened and to which a video of the broken watch needed to be sent. Once I agreed to post an updated (favorable?) review, a new watch was sent within 2 days. Bottom line: The watch *will* break and enacting the warranty is a bit of an adventure (but the company honored it in the end).', ""I was very hesitant to buy this watch after reading the reviews but I'm glad that I did. The watch came quickly and actually got to my house a day earlier than I was expecting. I bought this watch for my son to take along on a family vacation later this year.  Set up was a bit of a pain in the rear because the instructions were obviously not written by a native-English speaker and it took a bit of fiddling to get it to work. I managed to get everything set up in about an hour.The watch works pretty well so far though the tracker (GPS and LBS) is a bit off (but not enough to make me uncomfortable). GPS through wi-fi is off by about half a block but LBS is off by about an hour and a half (this is Pennsylvania, we measure distance in hours not miles). My sausage fingers had a bit of a time working the small touchscreen but my son has no issue. Luckily I can set up most stuff through the app. Calls come in pretty clear though it takes about 30 seconds between dialing and the phone to actually start ringing. This may be something with the carrier and not the watch itself.We've only had this a few days but I'm pretty satisfied with it so far.

You're watch is on airplane mode with all modes turned 'always off', yet your S2 watch 3g 4g Verizon is still draining battery like a champ. After you have tried all of the methods of disabling your watch from using any function has completed, there is one more thing (aside from doing a factory reset, or buying a new battery replacement**Battery replacements may also need to use my last step in order to not mimic the same draining issue as your old battery because even new batteries are old the reason being they were made roughly around the same time as that particular watch). Once your watch is completely dead, to where you cannot turn in on at all, you are going to need to hold the power button down for 30 seconds and wait for a flash, kind of like when you would turn off old tv sets and there would be like a white line flash in the middle of the screen as it shuts off or turns on. You will need to continue doing this process for at least 30-40 minutes so sit somewhere comfortable. With each interval of you pressing and holding the power button for 30 seconds (about 10-20 intervals), you will need to include a 15 second wait time between each interval. For example, Say I start the process now, I've got my watch in my hand and I'm starting the process by holding the power button for 30 seconds. 15 seconds in to holding the power button I see the flash across my screen, I still continue holding another 15 seconds to complete the first interval with the power button securely pressed. Once I reach the 30 second mark, I release the button and WAIT 30 seconds, pressing NOTHING. After waiting 30 seconds I start the second interval by holding the power button for 30 seconds, so on and so on. After about the 6 or 7th interval you should not see any more flashes across the screen, (If you continue seeing the flashes just keep doing intervals until you don't**eventually it will stop**, and if you don't see a flash on it at all or it stops sooner than 6 or 7 intervals, I would recommend you keep doing it until about the 6th or 7th interval just to be completely sure even if you see nothing), essentially what you are doing is draining, completely, the entire watch system of power and you should do this for at least 10- 20 30 secondn intervals with 30 seconds between each interval.. This method has improved my original battery watch from only holding a full charge for roughly 3 hours with everything deleted and turned off, to a watch that can go a nice day and a half with airplane mode on. I have yet to see how much juice I can use while listening to music through Bluetooth in saved music. I'm estimating at least 6 or 7 hours. Anyway, try this method with this being the most common issue pertaining to this watch, and also try this on other devices too, to fix similar or surprisingly different problems. A lot of techs do this to all of their electronic devices with Lithium Batteries at least once a year anyway to improve their experiences with their devices. Thanks!"", 'Very inexpensive.

I can video so that a plus other than that...not a happy customer."", ""Not so waterproof. Tracking wasn't the best but worked okay."", ""I did a lot of research before buying this watch, but alas, it was still not good enough for several reasons. First off, you can't change the date format from dd/mm to mm/dd. That's kind of a dealbreaker for those kids growing up and learning with mm/dd. It's quite surprising because this could be a simple software fix. Second, the accompanying app is really crappy. It's loaded with ads and you have to pay monthly fees to not see those ads. So don't think that you'd simply buy this watch and be done. Of course, you may want to insert a SIM and you may pay monthly for that, but may be you also need to account for monthly fees to this same company for removing very annoying ads. Then it seems you also can't disable the App Store on watch through which the kids can install social media and other apps. The main reason for buying this watch was to be able to have parental control, but seems there is no way to disable App Store or any apps. The watch UI and the instructions are not intuitive, but that was expected from a Chinese-made poorly translated product. That's where you are paying so low, but the rest of what is described here is non-excusable. I'm returning."", ""It took a little while for all the features to kick in, which was weird, but after the watch was fully updated and the sim card fully registered, it started working and did all that we needed/wanted. My daughter absolutely loves it! Fortunately, the do not disturb features, and parental controls ensure that the device is always used appropriately and doesn't cause issues at school. So far so good!"", 'At first it worked perfect. I could call my kid and he could call me back. But suddenly after a month they blocked it because it needed homologation for my country. I could not homologate it', 'So yes this was easy to buy and also shipped within 2wks. That was the only thing that was easy. I bought the sim card as was suggested in the details. I set up the ""Speed talk"" account and followed EXACT directions for the watch setup....now let me start by saying....I gave it 3days for the DATA to load on the watch, for everything to sync up(location of watch showed up in china/didn\'t update until 2.5 days) and yet by the 3rd day, watch could not receive/send calls, Contacts did not save in the watch app to control settings through my phone. I was unable to save any changes on the app or the watch. Customer service was not helpful, they only sent directions on ""how to take extra steps to set watch""...they kept saying ""give it time to load data and sync up""....This watch is made in China so I know why the location was wrong but this is frustrating. So yes I asked for a refund & returned the watch. My refund was not returned to the ""card"" I used to pay for this product, but instead the company gave me ""my money back"" in Amazon points to this account which by they way.....like wtf, I wasn\'t given an option of how I wanted the return to be transferred.I do not recommend this product. Now I have a SIM card which I paid for the 6 month plan and am unable to use it until I get a new gps smartwatch for my daughter who is doing in person learning... money down the drain.😒P.S I do have a picture of the watch but for some reason I can\'t download it onto this review.🙄', ""This watch looks really nice, but it does not come with clear instructions, there is no manufacturer website nor I was able to find in amazon has any troubleshooting link. I was not able to turn it on or connect it to the charging cable. The micro letters in the mini manual book that comes in the box were of no help, after attempting to read it with a magnifying glass and not finding any clear instructions in today's life where  all products have an online guide I decided to return it."", 'This watch seemed ok but after 3 months of use, one day, the silver side power button literally just fell off. I am passed the return date so now I have completely wasted almost $50. The app is not user friendly in that you have to pay in order to not have ads EVERY time you log in. While the watch wasn’t awesome, it did serve the purpose of being able to be in contact with my son without him having a phone, but it should last longer than 3 months! My son took very good care of it and was very responsible but the watch just fell apart and is poorly made! I would NOT recommend this product and am very disappointed. I tried to get a replacement but no luck.']"

I moved from iOS to Android and missed the watch that has the same functionality as the Apple Watch. It checks all the boxes of an Apple watch. It is great for the price.', 'Fine workmanship, fashionable appearance, elegant atmosphere, waterproof and sweat-proof, very beautiful.', 'Good quality with a relatively low price', ""Pros:-Attractive Build: Right out of the box, this watch boasts an appealing design that looks very sleek. Definitely earns points for aesthetics.-High-Quality Material: The build quality feels good.  The plastic, glass, and the metal portion of the watch body/face feel premium. The OLED display also stands out from all the IPS display watch screens used in watches in similar categories and types.-Built-in GPS: This feature is generally reserved for premium / higher end watches (and missing in smaller fitness bands, or generic smart watches).  It is impressive to have it on this watch.  With this feature, one can exercise without carrying a phone to track locations.  Based on my test, it seems to work quite well.-Ultra-long Battery Life: Truly impressive. Lasts more than a week without needing a recharge. This is a game-changer for those of us who came from the named brands (Apple & Samsung) which offer watches with a lot less battery life.-Great Display: Bright, clear, and responsive. Viewing in direct sunlight isn’t an issue with brightness turned up.  It even has always on display thanks to the OLED screen.-Raise to wake speed: This watch face turns on very quickly unlike some other generic brand watches that will take ~1s to wake up.Cons:-Heart Rate Monitoring: It's not continuous outside of exercise sessions. For a smartwatch in today's market, this is a significant drawback.  This tbh is a big letdown for me.  It does check heart rate at an interval, but I’d like to monitor my heart rate continuously.-Sleep Monitoring Issues: Does not track naps, which is a letdown for daytime sleepers.  I consider it to be a big drawback for me. Also, accuracy leaves much to be desired.  I’ve benchmarked this with my Fitbit Sense, which is known to have good sleep tracking.  I wore both to sleep.  I’d say this watch had some struggle with tracking accurate sleep stages (deep, rem, light), but overall it seems to be doing ok just to track overall sleep time.  I also once got this period of time it confused me to be sleeping while I wasn’t wearing the watch.  It felt buggy.-Missing some key features: such as payment, which is readily available for most established name brands - Samsung, Apple, Garmin, Fitbit etc.  It is rare for a generic brand to support that, but it is important to be aware of this clear tradeoff.Conclusion: While there's a lot to appreciate about this smart watch, especially the design and battery life, its drawbacks in key areas like heart rate and sleeping tracking for me really unfortunately were the deal breakers.Given the competitive landscape of smartwatches these days, I think this watch is trying to stand out from a group of generic smart watches.  It does have a lot of great / differentiating features, but I can't give it my full endorsement. I’d advise potential buyers to explore established brands for a more rounded experience."", 'Many of these ""off brand"" smart watches have one or two issues that cause them not to be useful. I am sure everyone has their own sticking point, but for me, it is size, battery life, and notification handling. Most of these lower cost watches have excellent battery life, so that one is covered. This one looks like it will easily last a week. By comparison, my Galaxy Watch 4 only lasts about a day and half. When I used an Apple Watch it only lasted a day. I am not charging my watch daily. So, the second issue is size. This one is a nice size. Not too small and not too large. I like them on the larger side so I can read notifications like text messages. Most of these watches try to cram as much text on the screen with the font so small that it\'s impossible to read. Also, they typically only display the first few lines of a text message. This one has a larger font, and it allows you to scroll the message! Also, it has an ""always on"" feature for the display. I have this enabled and it does not appear to have a big effect on battery life. It also has the ability to play a sound for notifications (ding) as well as vibration. You can turn off the sound and/or vibration but I could not find a way to change the sound. You can set the sound volume. The weather supports a 5-day forecast and it supports taking and making calls from the watch.It has a few drawbacks as it is very thick and there are very few watch faces. I could not really find a watch face that I liked. I think this is a new watch and maybe more faces are coming. I wish these manufacturers offered a tool where you could create your own watch face. For now, this is my daily driver.', 'The AMOLED display on this fitness tracker is crisp and easy to read. Battery life is also impressive, but only when the ""always on"" feature is disabled. Features like the step counter, heart rate, and sleep tracker work well. Not so great are the smartwatch features. For example, the watch has a find my phone feature that is not reliable unless the phone is synched to the app periodically. Also, the weather app on the watch has to be synched manually to the Fitbeing app every 6 hours for it to work.Alerts that remind you to keep moving also occasionally come on even if you are moving. I also found that if the activity tracker is enabled, the watch will not allow you to use other apps simultaneously. In addition, it’s best to skip the GPS connect feature when starting an exercise as it fails to connect most of the time.Some features that work reliably are receiving notifications on the watch and making calls. Manual dialing on the smartwatch is possible, but adding favorites using the companion app is better. The Fitbeing app while simple, connects the watch easily and is easy to use. I also like that it’s not required to make an account to use the smartwatch.I think this is a functional fitness tracker with a stellar display and comfortable wrist strap, but I was not impressed by the smartwatch features.

Thing starts up quick and has some good customizations available, also decent internal speaker when connected to bluetooth. Can also act as a remote shutter for your camera.Some problems I had.First is the size, I have a average to smaller size male wrist, this thing is huge compared to any watch I've owned in the past.Second the bezel on this seems to be off center, lower portion of the screen seems to have more space than the top.Third is the 'health' options on this. Appears to offer blood pressure feature, definitely no where near accurate. Same with the O2 reading option.Big issue for me is the heart rate and exercise functions.I wore this and my Apple watch to the gym at the same time for the true test. Heart rate on this watch was all over the map, comparing to the treadmill I was on that offered a true heart rate reading. Apple watch was nearly spot on, this thing was 20-30 bpm lower than the actual reading.Not only is this off in general, but causes a much lower reading for the calories burned, etc. Not ideal.For the price, its okay, clearly I can't ask this thing to do the same job as a $300 watch.My ask would be not to advertise something you clearly aren't able to follow up on feature wise, especially with blood pressure or heart rate which could lead people down a path of assuming their health is in another boat that it really is."", 'An entry level smartwatch that provides most of the options one is seeking in a smartwatch, but doesn\'t care to pay a mint for it.That is to say,  if you\'re looking for an Apple/Galaxy tier watch at this price, you may want to keep shopping.  If you\'re looking for the basic features and a few of the biometric extras, this may work for you.The large face and crystal clear readability are definitely both pluses, and the functionality is fairly intuitive even for someone not extensively familiar with smartwatch operation and function.  The biometric aspect is present and decent.  Is it spot on? No.  So if this is critical in your decision-making process, be aware.Not a huge fan of the ""Da Fit"" app, but that\'s a matter of personal preference, and may not affect your decision one way or another.', ""This is my first smartwatch. The documentation was a bit slim, but installing the 'da fit' app was easy and their site provides better setup info. While it has some features I won't use, others are very useful. I like being able to make and take phone calls from the watch. It has a number of physical measurements, heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen, sleep quality, etc. Also, step count and time. I probably won't use these for definitive medical measures, but they can show trends over time. The 'Find Phone' feature works very well and I'll likely need it at some point. Having weather, timer, flashlight and calculator handy are also pluses. The battery lasts a surprisingly long time.I did swap the silicone band for a stainless steel magnetic one. The original clasp was kind of awkward and with a narrower wrist way too much band extended past the clasp. The magnetic band fits better for me, holds securely and is easier to adjust to get full contact with skin for measurements.Overall, the watch is a good addition to my electronics."", ""I've been using this watch for several days now and I'm still not sure if I like it.  Maybe it's just me, but it takes some trial and error to figure it out.  I was having problems with the kcal reading.  I'm an active person, I take martial arts classes 5 days a week, and pilates/yoga 2 or 3 times a week.  However, my kcal reading at the end of the day would only be around 300 burned.  I finally realized that I have to tell the watch when I'm about to start working out, by setting it to the activity that I'm doing, and also set it for the time/duration of my workout.  Only then does it count those kcals burned, which I think is weird.  I haven't seen any other reviewers mention this, and I just assumed that as long as you're wearing the watch, it will track all your activity and automatically be able to tell that you're working out, and therefore burning more kcals. Because of this, I'm skeptical if the other readings, such as step count, heart rate etc are really accurate.  Also if I forget to set it before my class, then the count is totally off, which is annoying.  The battery life is really good, and there are a few other positive features, so I will keep wearing it for now, and hopefully I can figure it out eventually."", 'For a budget minded smart watch, this one is pretty well contructed, much more robust than many others i have seen. While it does not have all the functions of high end smart watches, it does have all the basic necessities of a smart watch like health monitoring, time, date, call control, media control, etc. The battery life is great considering how fast it charges from 10% to 100%. The included watch band is also pretty comfortable for all day wear too. The only drawback to this watch is a drawback for most budget minded smart watches, I seriously question the accuracy of the health monitoring tools. Is the accuracy horrible? No, not at all, but for those who rely heavily on that being 100% accurate, this is an important thing to note.', ""It has a nice look and feels great on the wrist. Lightweight with easy swipe gestures. The software is fairly limited however useful enough for everyday wear. I find the charger a little finicky but once connected it charges fairly quickly. There are a limited number of watch faces however those that are available are colorful and informative. One of the information panels (while measuring blood pressure) contains some grammatical errors which confused me a bit. Once I understood that the watch was indicating I needed to re-run the blood pressure task it worked fine. Seems to be fairly accurate too. It's a great value for the money and one of the better inexpensive watches I've worn."", ""This is a quality smartwatch that you can make and  recieve calls. The battery doesn't last as long as long as other smartwatches I have had but it will last a couple of days if your not constantly listening to music or on the phone. It has a quality appearance and an app that is easy to use."", 'This is my review on the anyloop Smart Watch for Men and Women.This is a nice cheap product that does what it says it can do.The heart monitor could be better.It takes some messing around to get it to work properly.It does not automatically take your heart rate, that is one negative about this product.It also counts your steps which can be inaccurate, if you move your arm it counts it as a step.Altogether not a bad product for the price.Thanks for reading my review.', 'Decent sound, and works well for the most part but will not sync with my texts even after following trouble shooting instructions']"

It comes with many watch faces you can choose from. Some of them looks even better than Apple Watch faces in my opinion. It also comes with 2 watch band. The watch has big display but very lightweight which is big plus for me. All the sports and activities tracking functionalities work well so far. Waterproof function seems fine too, I am able to swim with it without any problems.', 'Nice looking smart watch with all necessary functions to meet your needs for convenience as well as achieve your fitness goals. I like the UI design a lot as I can easily jump through different functions. The price is also very affordable.', ""Firstly, this is the first time I've ever owned a smartwatch or fitness band, so that's the perspective I'm coming from. Personally, I think this is cool, even though the techie in me is telling me it pretty basic. If you're looking for an intro smartwatch with a few useful features outside of fitness tracking, this watch is pretty nice.The main features I use are time (of course), weather, notification checking and I've answered a call or two. Surprisingly, the call quality is pretty good for such a small device with a Lilliputian speaker. I also check my health stats occasionally, but I don't know how accurate a sensor you get for around $50. I tried using the steps thing, but I walk assisted holding onto a shopping cart or walker and the step count based on arm motion. Just something to keep in mind.The watch face library isn't as extensive as you'd think, and there's only one option for a personalized watch face (you can move the time position top to bottom though). This watch only uses the apps on it. The phone app for it is fine, but it's just for uploading watch faces and tracking data. You can change setting in it, but you can do that right on the watch. The theme here is that it's nice, but not anything special.The biggest plus with this particular watch is the screen. It is quite large, but not in an obtrusive way. It sits decently flat on the wrist, bit has a great rugged look. The completely metal build is awesome. The included bands are fine. I don't like the plastic one, because it's a pain to take on and off for charging. The metal one has the opposite problem. The clasp part only catches to one peg, and the release tabs are ultra sensitive.The spacing between the contacts is not a semi-typical 4mm, and so far I've found several sellers on Amazon to get them from. It charges fine, pretty quickly and a charge lasts for a long time.So, I'd suggest this watch to get your feet wet in the smartwatch game if you're not looking to install apps and are good with the features I listed and a few small other ones. It's a good fitness watch, but might be a little heavy for most sports or running (because of the bouncing). I'll be keeping it to use for sure, though my need side is now craving more capabilities. Never thought I'd wear a smartwatch, but now I feel odd when I don't have it on."", 'I banged it against a couple of walls and a door by accident and it didn’t get scratch on the important bits. There I started to believe on the military part of the description of this watch. All the four screws on the face of this watch started losing the paint job but it doesn’t look terrible in my eyes. I thinks the developers should look into better quality paint. The picking up calls on the watch is neat and clean but I cannot adjust the volume. I can hear everything only in a very quiet room, in other places I can only make out words. That has to be look at. My over all experience has been positive. I like it. It has become my go to watch for the majority of my outings.', 'Ok so this watch\'s best feature is also it\'s worst and let me tell you why.The dial on the side quickly switches between watch faces which is way faster than I have ever seen any smart watch work. With that being said it is easy and happened often to where my wrist would bump the dial and end up switching the watch faces. This may be different for users who wear their watch further up the arm and may be just an issue with where I wear my watch.The screen looks amazing, the watch face I have pictured looks so realistic it looks like a normal watch at a glance. The second hand is so smooth and high resolution it looks the part! There is not a huge selection of faces in the app, but the ones available are quite good and there is an option to put your own picture and even select what you want on the face as far as info and where you would like it. It isn\'t very customizable as it gives you options of where on the screen out of preset choices so you can\'t freely move and place info to get precise.The watch is plenty bright even at the lowest setting. The shake to wake function works well most of the time and can be disabled to avoid accidental activation like during sleeping.Sleep tracking is the most accurate I have seen of all the smartwatches I have had and even gives you an average for the week and more useful information in the app. Other functtions such as step tracking, heartrate, BP and SpO2 appear fairly accurate within a few points when checked against acual medical rated equipment.One issue I have noticed that seems to be among most smartwatches is when receiving a fb message it will repeatedly notify ""new conversation"" and ""start a conversation"" which I am not sure if it is an issue with the OS these watches use or an issue with fb messenger notifications. I just turrn off notifications for messenger as I only need important information on my watch.The call audio going in an out is both decent and clear but has no noticeable volume adjustment.Using assistant through the watch works but in loud areas it is difficult to hear the assistants response.One common issue among most of these ""budget"" smart watches is the lack of being able to respond or send text messages. You can use the assistant, but I feel even just preset responses would be very helpful to quickly respond to a message.My watch battery lasted almost a full 6 days with moderate use, shake to wake enabled and screen brightness halfwayy. Pretty impressive for a budget watch.Overall I don\'t know why people spend more on other watches when these perform so well for the price!', 'I was attracted to this watch because it looks sleek and is all metal. Bonus that it comes with a regular strap band. The watch itself is heavy. The metal band is lightweight, which doesn’t match the feel of the watch. The metal band fits me a bit loose, so have to have it adjusted. This watch runs on DaFit app which I’m happy about because I’m familiar with the app. SPO2 is a bonus.  So far it works as it should. The standby time is amazing! No need for frequent charging. Easy to recommend!', ""Obviously this comes with the drawbacks that come with not using one of the mainline smartwatch OSsBUT, the heart rate, blood oxygen, and blood pressure all seems accurate. Once synced notifications and time sync fine. The alarm function works great. The display is gorgeous all things considered too.There's only 3 main gripes I have that make me almost not wanna recommend.- There's a tracking notification that comes up only on the watch multiple times a minute I couldn't get to go away. Maybe someone else can find a way to circumvent this.- I couldn't get the media control function to work at all.- I couldn't find what the AI voice function was supposed to do, let alone I couldn't manage to use it anyway.Honestly though for the list of health tracking features it's a decently easy recommend. But of course I'd you've the money to go a bit higher up to get the same features with a more stable OS I'd say do that."", ""The watch feels solid and well built, with good looking detail and outer graphics.All of the features so far seem to be working pretty well, other than the medical measurements. I compared them to my blood oxygen and blood pressure devices and both readings were far enough off to be concerning, so I'm not convinced the watch's readings are totally reliable.I like being able to answer my phone without having to carry it around or pull it out of my pocket. And the watch functions are pretty much the same as using my phone, so there really isn't much of a learning curve for answering calls. Unfortunately, I can't figure out how to access the number key pad during a call for voicemail features, and there is no mention of it in the instructions, so I'm assuming you can't do that, which can be a real limitation when making calls.The sound quality on making calls is pretty good, but I think you are stuck with whatever volume your phone is set on so you might want to put it on high when using your watch.Also, I saw no mention of it in the ad but my watch came with a second, slightly different but same color, watch band, so that was a nice surprise.Bottom line for me, this is a pretty good watch/phone accessory but it's not perfect. But I'd say pretty good for the money.I hope this helps. Thanks for reading and liking."", ""Honestly I didn't have much faith in it being that it was so cheap, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Looks like a cheap iwatch knock off, but it is surprisingly well built.  It comes with 2 types of bands, one metal and one rubber/plastic.  The connection and set up was super easy and straight forward.  The heart rate, blood pressure, sleep, step counter and blood oxygen monitors work great though I am sure the blood pressure is a little off.  There are several standard backgrounds to chose from but there is an option to make your own background out of pictures from you phone.  You can customize the information shown on the watch and how long it takes to go back to sleep.  Now for the down sides.  The step counter is a little too sensitive and gives inaccurate step counts, the watch does not have app support that I can find and from what I can tell does not have a lock screen and no link to Apple, Samsung or Google pay.  Other then that I love it."", 'I actually have quite a few smart watches, and this one is my new favorite. I think it\'s great looking, I\'m very fond of the orange band. And the app has 100 additional watch faces so there\'s bound to be something for everyone. The majority of my watches all monitor A LOT of different things, and offer A TON of sports modes. But this thing takes it to a whole other level. I can\'t imagine anyone using anything close to all of them, but whatever you\'re looking for I feel like this watch can do it.This is the only one I have that is actually capable of taking calls directly. The others can only do that (if at all) while you\'re also using a BT earbud/mic (even though a number of them claimed to have that functionality). Another thing which also sets this watch apart from the others is that it\'s actually waterproof. The others said they were waterproof, but later in reading the included literature I see ""Do not wear while swimming"" or ""Do not wear in to the shower"". So in reality, they\'re only water resistant. The user\'s manual for this watch explicitly says ""Ok to wear swimming"" and ""Ok to wear while showering"". Lol, now that\'s waterproof.This thing works well will Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. Using either one, it can do Voice wake up, or you can set up any type of reminder you may want and it can do those via voice also. Most of my other watches can only adjust which track is playing on my Bluetooth speaker or change the volume. This watch can actually play the music itself. That\'s pretty cool 😎. And the battery lasts so much longer, I\'d say it lasts at least twice as long as the watch in second place.The only thing I can think of that someone may want that this watch can\'t do, would be to play either an Android or iOS app. And unfortunately to get that, you will have to spend like 4 times as much. Otherwise I would say if you\'re thinking about it, why not give this one a try. Like I said, it\'s my new favorite. I\'m having a lot of fun with it, and it gets compliments all the time. I would definitely recommend this smart watch😁👍😎👌']"

The watch itself is quite chunky, so it sticks out quite a bit on my daughter\'s wrist. The screen is quite large at 1.85"" and the graphics are very good. There are a few minor niggles with the balance of features between the app and the watch itself: for instance, you can only set alarms on the app. You can switch on or switch off all alarms, but you can\'t enable them individually without going to the app. Also, for some reason, wrist-sense can only be turned on and off from the app, and not from the screen of the watch. I can\'t really comment on the accuracy of the measurements such as steps, HR, BP etc. but they don\'t seem to be giving crazy figures, so I guess they are reasonable.

The watch requires connectivity with Manufacturer APP and cellular device to fully function.  Bluetooth is through APP and not direct connection to cellular unit. WARRANTY STATEMENT - 12 months.The watch arrived charged ready to setup and use. Either available operating systems can be used. Download APP and then registration.  Follow prompts on cellular device and watch (together) to complete setup.  With the Review Unit there was an upgrade available so that process completed. Progress readouts are shown during upgrade.The watch sets up to local time and date.  Temperature is Centigrade and can be changed to Fahrenheit. The watch has ability to answer phone calls but this function can be turned off.  This watch functionality provides control to more features than any other Smartwatch in the price range or lower. The screen can be Full Time ON on set for several different time-periods in which I chose 20 seconds. Screen comes on with arm motion or push button on side.  The Pushbutton also is scroll control to move up/down screen items.  Up/Down also controls by finger movement on screen.  One feature I liked, which I have not seen previously on this type watch, is WEATHER graphics and Multi-Day forecast information.  This was all setup automatically through the APP.THERE ARE many Watch Face options from which to choose.  Some are free.  Some have a cost attached! The ones shown in my pictures are all no cost.  The colors are vivid and bright with text crisp. Brightness can be User Set at prescribed level or placed in automatic.  My observation is Automatic is too dim ( for me ) for daylight viewing.  I preset and like better. The vibration alert level can be set but default worked OK for me.The screen does not always respond when in a feature not desired which you want to leave.  In that case the Pushbutton on the side gets back to main screen.Moving from screen to screen in some cases smoothly but other times not as responsive. That, not being able to locate all settings quickly and at this price point NO AC Module included are my negatives.Recommended…. Four  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  StarI appreciate your time and interest looking at the Review.  Thank you !  My intent is you experience it Useful, Informative, Valuable and HELPFUL! 😃', ""I have been a hard core Apple Watch user since the original, and have only occasionally dipped my toe in other models. After having used an Apple Watch Ultra for the last year, I decided it was time to just give something else a try. This one came in great packaging, was easy to setup, and has everything you need to get started. The 22mm lugs and easily removable straps mean you can dress this thing up or down, and fit it to your lifestyle. The watch and included band are both comfortable, the battery life is impressive, and all in all this thing seems very solid. The OLED display is incredible by the way. I was shocked at the quality of the screen and speed of the processor you get for the money.My list of concerns is small, and shouldn't dissuade you. 1) You have to use a third party app for this. The app has been around a while, manages your watch, and is just part of the deal when you leave the Apple ecosystem. It just feels cheap to me, and I'm not super convinced that the data collected by it isn't going to third, fourth, and fifth parties. 2) The red ring around the crown is an obvious nod to Apple, but doesn't indicate this thing is cellular capable - spoiler alert: it's not. Outside of those two things, I'm going to go ahead and keep this around for when I get tired of the black rectangles on my wrist."", ""The battery life on this Amazfit watch is by far the best I've seen on any smart watch. You really have to use it a lot for it to go down much. It also charges very rapidly.I previously used a Samsung watch and had to charge it every day, with overnight being the best time which made sleep tracking impractical. Not so with this watch; a quick charge will keep it going for days.Super-responsive when touching or displaying anything on screen. The UI is all very intuitive. Not much customization required out of the box, but there are plenty of options should you want to.No problems pairing it or using it with my OnePlus 8 Pro which is 3 years old now. Everything works really smoothly.Heartrate tracking sometimes takes a while to correct itself and get an accurate read, but that's pretty typical with all smartwatches and it works well overall.Overall this just seems a better choice than some of the leading brands, even if for the battery life alone."", ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0INTRO:I tell friends, family, and acquaintances that, in my opinion, AmazFit with ZeppOS is the best fitness smartwatch brand most people have never heard of.Three years ago, I decided to experiment with the AmazFit Bip S as a knock-around watch I would wear when I didn’t want to risk damaging a $350 Michael Kors smartwatch I wore daily.  I loved it so much, that I stopped wearing the MK watch, and later eventually upgraded to the AmazFit GTR 3 when I started craving more advanced features.  I’ve now been wearing the AmazFit GTR 3 daily for almost 2 years and I have grown a strong appreciation for the AmazFit brand, ZeppOS, and the Zepp App.  However, as much as I love my GTR 3, there are some features it doesn’t have, and I have been craving another upgraded experience.  When the AmazFit Balance model and its new features were announced, I decided that it was time to upgrade again.The following review focuses on the new standout features of the Balance watch along with comparisons, for better or worse, to the GTR 3 model.  This product was evaluated using the iOS version of the Zepp App and was paired with an iPhone 11 for receiving notifications.A little bit about myself: I have 25+ years of experience in the technology field and vast experience reviewing tech gadgets as well as accessories that go with them (power banks, chargers, cables, etc).  I consider myself a power user of technology and make it a point to familiarize myself with most or all of the features and configurable settings of the products I use — this allows me to obtain the best possible experience and performance from them.PROS:This watch is stylish and attractive — I’ve already received a few compliments on it.The display screen is gorgeous and is larger, brighter, and sports a higher resolution than the GTR 3.I like the improved charging cable — the small cup magnetically attaches to the watch's backside and is designed to mitigate unintended separation or swiveling.  This is a major upgrade from the magnetic GTR 3 charging cable which pulled off the back of the watch with the slightest tug on the cable.I love that I can now hear an audible tone through the watch’s speaker when notifications arrive.  This was something I had long wished for (see note in my CONS section).  The watch has only a single master volume level for all alert tones, music, and phone calls.  It can be quickly adjusted or muted through the watch’s control center.The ability to store MP3 music files locally on the watch is new for me and something I’ve long wanted to be able to do.  I also love that they can be played through the watch’s internal speaker or I can play the audio through Bluetooth audio gear connected directly to the watch.The crown rotates smoothly and is very responsive.  The crown on the GTR 3 would sometimes turn with a lagged response on the watch’s screen.Animations and screen transitions are buttery smooth on this watch with ZeppOS 3.0.  They’ve always been that way on previous devices as well, but for those who aren’t familiar with AmazFit or ZeppOS, I thought it was worth noting here.The secondary button on this watch is short and flat, which is a marked improvement over the one on the GTR 3.  The protruding button on the GTR 3 would often get pressed accidentally by movements that involved the wrist bending backward.  I have not experienced any accidental button presses so far with the redesigned button on the Balance watch.The ability to make and take Bluetooth phone calls on the Balance watch is new and much appreciated!  Call quality varies — it’s not a good replacement for a handset, but it’s great for those times (such as workouts) when a call comes in and my phone isn’t immediately near me to physically answer the call.  Active calls can be transferred from the watch back to the handset if desired.The new Readiness feature is very interesting.  This feature is new and currently only available on the Balance watch.  My initial impression was that it might be a gimmick.  However, I am surprised how fairly accurately it has reflected how I am feeling physically and mentally in the morning using the data it automatically collects while wearing the watch during sleep.  I’m still evaluating its usefulness for me, though for now, I will continue to consult with the report each morning and use it to reflect on my day ahead.The new app selection screen in ZeppOS 3.0 copies the tiled design that Apple uses on the Apple Watch.  While it’s not original, it’s much-needed, and something I’ve been yearning for as the amount of ZeppOS apps has increased dramatically — it’s become overwhelming to have to scroll through the apps as a list (see note in my CONS section).ZeppOS 3.0 now groups alert notifications by App.  I love this new change because it means less unwanted scrolling.  I appreciate that notifications that may have shared meaning, such as text messages and news headlines, are now able to be seen side-by-side without the distraction of unrelated notifications appearing between them.CONS:The vibration system on this watch feels as weak or worse than it does on the GTR 3 — I’ve missed critical high heart rate bpm alerts during workouts because of it.  This is disappointing because it also leads to missed notifications sometimes when the weak vibrations are not felt.  To help combat the problem, I created custom vibration alerts using the Zepp app but it’s still not a perfect solution.  At least the Balance now has an internal speaker and an alert tone that can be played when new notifications come in.  Despite that, I would still like to see AmazFit finally address this issue.I was disappointed to see that Zepp Pay is not available inside the Zepp App to allow payments using NFC on the watch.  I was greatly looking forward to this feature after reading about it in a press release announcement for this watch.  Searching online revealed that this feature isn’t available in the USA where I am located.The watch has WiFi but the Amazon Alexa feature still requires that the watch must communicate with the smartphone companion app over Bluetooth to be able to use it.The WiFi feature is also not usable for syncing watch data to my Zepp account in the Cloud or with the app on my phone.The battery life on a single charge is incredible and will probably dazzle most people (especially those with Apple Watches who are used to having to recharge them daily) — the AmazFit balance can last at least 5 days or more on a single charge depending on what settings are configured.  Unfortunately, as great as the battery life is, it was a minor disappointment to see it consume a tiny bit quicker on the Balance watch than it does on the GTR 3.  There could be many reasons for this, including the new internal speaker, the upgraded display, the upgraded additional sensors, the use of making Bluetooth phone calls through the watch, and initial high-frequency use of the watch as I try to become familiar with it.  That said, I think the improvements are worth the slight increase in battery usage.  If anything drastically changes when my typical daily usage returns to normal, I will add an UPDATE section to this review.The speaker is located very low and to the middle side of the watch.  As a result, my skin has blocked the speaker a few times, causing some muffled audio.  This isn’t a constant issue, but on the few occasions that I’ve noticed it, it’s annoying and a poor location for the speaker.REVIEW SUMMARY:There's so much that this watch can do (and still a few things it can’t do) that it would be overwhelming to try to cover it all.  Overall, I’m thrilled that I waited to upgrade to the Balance watch, I think the wait was worth it.The top things I love about this product are the gorgeous upgraded screen, the built-in speaker and ability to make and take phone calls on my wrist, the redesigned charging cable and secondary button, and the various UI/UX changes made in ZeppOS 3.0.The top things I don’t like are the absence of Zepp Pay, the weak vibration system, and the baffling undersupported use of the WiFi module.VERDICT:I highly recommend it!IMPORTANT NOTE:I spend a very lengthy amount of time using the products I review, and I often spend even longer documenting them in writing, photos, and occasionally videos, for your benefit.  If you found this review to be insightful, please mark it helpful below — it lets me and Amazon know that I’m doing a good job.  Thank you, and have a great day!""]"

I keep AOD off since it is usually under my sleeve and can't see it anyway but it lets me have a complicated watch face and still great battery life. I charge it every second evening which is way better than my last smartwatch. Just got the Flip 5 so it will be nice to see the watch and phone match up. Should let me keep the phone in my pocket 80% of the time."", ""I found that my 2 Samsung Galaxy smart watches tend to lose functionality over time. Then some functions stop working like tracking one's sleep.  The solution to this problem is to simply reboot the watches ny pressing both side buttons and holding them until the watch starts the reboot process.  I'm going to do this once per months for my Samsung Galaxy watches AND my Samsung Galaxy S21 phone."", ""The same as the title. It's been super comfortable to wear and all the apps it offers for free is pretty fantastic. Setting the watch to charge on a fast charger for less than an hour every 2 days is of little inconvenience to me when it's helping me run and have a more active lifestyle. Definitely beats out all other $100 watches that come with a subscription."", 'It is exactly what they said ,very pleased  Thank you', 'Used watch for a couple of weeks, and it has a lot of exiting features! But one thing I definitely DO NOT LIKE is it\'s battey life. (had a Fitbit Sense 2 watch where the battery always lasted 6 DAYS before needing recharging.)As an experiment I charged my Galaxy watch 6 classic 47 mm. to 100%. Then I set the watch to ""Power Saving"". I didn\'t do anything that used a lot of power. Mostly I used it as a watch, but I did track my sleeping, and I did an ECG 3 times. The battery was down to 4% charge in only 2 days, so I had to recharge. The Fitbit Sense 2 costs about $100 less, and it lasted 6 days before needing charging.. And the Sense 2 is lighter, and a lot thinner.The Galaxy watch 6 classic, 47 mm. is a great watch, but why did Samsung choose to power it with a crummy, inadequate battery?', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Me gustó mucho.', ""I've always been a samsung guy, but they really dropped the ball with the watch 6.Battery doesn't last 48 hours, constantly dropps connection from phone, Paying with NFC always takes multiple attempts to the point that is is literally faster to pull out my credit card, app is not intuitive, compass inaccurate, and the list goes on.I honest wish I didn't buy this."", ""A little disappointed, can't get sleep tracking to work.

So getting this watch is like buying a spaceship, they're light years ahead of the last watch I had. Bright, very functional, no delays, sensors are outstanding, and GPS is pretty accurate, though not as accurate as a cell phone yet. I am currently in my house, and my phone shows my exact position, while the watch says I'm 30 feet away, in my driveway. Cannot comment on the battery, but hopefully it is good.Love the rotating bezel. Love the face options. Love that I have google wallet on my wrist and don't need to get my phone out to use it now. Love the step function, heart monitor, and most of the apps that come preloaded. Love how it syncs effortlessly with my S23 Ultra.The main reason I got this watch is because I have been diagnosed with sleep apnea, and want to monitor my sleep. So far, the sleep function is awesome, although tracking REM is always iffy with watches, this one seems to be pretty accurate compared to my sleep tests. I broke my back years ago, so I will not be using it to track standard gym type workouts, as most movements required in exercising are very painful, but I do like monitoring my steps and going on long hikes in the mountains so this will be perfect for my limited uses.I have a wrist that is 7.55 inches, so the bands that come with watches never fit and usually go straight into the trash. I got a stretchy cloth band set for $15 on Amazon and each of the 5 colors is so comfortable and look excellent with the black watch.Smart watches have finally realized the potential that they talked about for years and years, and I'm so happy with my new watch."", ""Edit ! Please read. I have found it absolutly annoying the sleep tracker doesn't work all the time. I have found a fix , shut off touch screen to wake and raise wrist to wake on have on the side buttons to wake the watch while you sleep. If you don't you end up touching the screen turning the bezel or something and it wakes it up and will not record everything. After I did that it even started recording my napsFirst review * I absolutly love it! I have the 47 mm and I think it's perfect. I absolutely love the heart rate, bloodoxygen and EKG sensors.Works pretty good but I can see why some people say when you turn the bezel it's kind of weird switching through the screens but that's only  one small issue. I found out if you open developer options and switch the animation speeds to .5 instead of 1X that fixes the bezel delay but other than that it's great. I have an anxiety disorder so I love staring at the stress meter haha helps you regain some grounding."", 'Over the past month dealing with the watch 6 I discovered the issue with the watch isn\'t the bluetooth as first suspected but actually the WIFI. I believe this is a software issue and needs to be fixed by Samsung but I guess it could be my watch (Though the other bad review did talk about issues with the sensors and battery)What is happening with the watch is it will disconnect from your phone about 20-30 seconds after hooking it up to a charge. The bluetooth will shut off and even if you go into the settings and try to turn it back on, it just turns back off within seconds. The only way to reconnect to the phone again is to reboot the watch and then it will connect to the phone again.After doing several factory resets I decided not to import any of any old data and try to start from \'scratch\' .. in doing so I found it didn\'t disconnect when I hooked it to a charge but then I started setting up the watch and entered the wifi information and it tried to connect to the wifi. Bluetooth turned off and I was disconnected from the phone. I shut off wifi and now the watch is semi usable, just slow downloading with bluetooth and no wifi.Samsung Care also gets a fail for this product. Dealt with their support twice and the first time I was giving a ""ticket"" to have the watch looked at locally by a local shop and after wasting the gas to go to the shop they didn\'t know what I was talking about with the ticket and said the watch was too new and they didn\'t have access to the parts. The second guy had me go to a site and fill out a form to get a \'ticket\' to go back to that same shop and I asked the tech.. they couldn\'t fix it today but now that I have this ticket they are going to magically be able to fix it? he assured me that it was because I didn\'t have the ticket that the shop couldn\'t access the parts. So I wasted my gas again and was told what I though ... they couldn\'t fix it yesterday and nothing has changed and I looked like a fool. I was also told that I could have it taken care of by Samsung. It would only be about 1 to 2 months and I would get a replacement if they couldn\'t fix it. I figured I would just return it to Amazon and maybe take the chance of buying another one and hope it was a fluke but Amazon told me the return process would take about a month because it was a high end item ???? sorry .. that\'s fishy... why do you want to hold my money for a month because I purchased a defective item. Strange the 20 dollar item I got on accident, they didn\'t have any issues returning in about 3 hours (returned to an Amazon Whole Foods store). The worst part is .. I was willing to bring it to the whole foods store and once they had it in their hands .. I didn\'t even care about the ""refund"" I just wanted them to send out a new watch with their one day prime shipping since I\'m a prime member. I will say that Amazon tried a little to help with what I was dealing with but the fact that they held my review for so long ... well.. it doesn\'t look goodAmazon also gets one star for how its handling Samsung\'s reviews:This is my second try at posting a review on this watch. It has been a week of waiting for it to post with no reason. I contacted Amazon 2 times and still nothing so now I\'m rewriting the review so maybe this time it will show up. Amazon has been suspicious in this manner so you judge it as you will. I tried to post a video that shows what I explain below but it wont accept it. I asked Amazon about the format and was told mp4 or mov less that 5gig. I tried both and they both failed. Ok well lets see if I can get away with this .. if you go to youtube you can search for Samsung Watch 6 Classic Wifi Bug (should be the first result) and see the issue in full ..it\'s a long video but it also shows the speed of the watch. You may want to watch it in double speed lol.This is a review on my experience with the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. It deals with the watch and the support  of the watch. Understand that my experience may not the what everyone should expect but also understand that it might. Unfortunately I can\'t post the ""proof"" of what I am saying because of suspicious circumstances. I have no way of posting the video nor a place for posting the conversations I had with the samsung techs or amazon. Hopefully this review will be posted in the next day or two and not be another week with no explanation or reasons why', 'Installing new watch faces from the store is a very, very frustrating experience.  There are no instructions on how to get them to appear on your watch.  The ones I have tried to install require some additional app to be installed, and then when you select ""Open on watch"", all you see is a Refund button and some reviews of the watch face.  You do not get the watch face!This is not ready for prime time.', ""This is a Day One review meaning I JUST got this watch so these are very initial observations. So far... this is excellent.  I've been looking for a watch to replace my trusty Samsung Gear S3 Frontier 46mm that served its purpose well for years. I bought the Galaxy Watch 4 (non-Classic) and wasn't as pleased with it.  I really like the quality of this watch and the feel.  I have the watch protected with a screen protector and a Spigen Rugged Armor Pro Case.  I'm sure as time passes we will get more in-depth reviews but for now, from an avid Samsung watch user... this watch is great. :)"", 'Not disappointed better then the 3 frontier I been wearing for the last 5 years', 'Definitely an upgrade from the watch 4, battery life is better and the screen and fluidity feels sleek', 'Ta bueno', 'The WORST Galaxy Watch, EVER!!!

They Haven\'t Even Bothered To Educate & Train Their Staff About Any Of Their Products!!!

I literally didn't have to do much at all - registering it online with the SN visible on the back side of the watch was so easy - and seemed to automatically connect with phone. I swear, I blinked and was set up!It's been as far back as the when I replaced my first Galaxy watch (was it a 2?) with the Fitbit Charge, and from then forward I was enjoying the FB's app and displays, and cheaper pricing. I stuck with that.This Galaxy comes out at a time shortly after Google purchasing FB, and the changes are just not as appealing. I wanted something more universal, so I've returned to GalaxyWatch!It is heavier than I'd thought it would be, but even that and the extra thickness after wearing it for a few hours, I'm not even noticing it. I currently have the FB on the right wrist, and Galaxy on left.Figuring out how to use some of the features like O2 and ECG was a little tricky, but it gives you a step by step both on the phone and/or on the watch itself and walks you through it. On the O2, if you're not holding it like it says - it doesn't actually prompt to start. That had me flustered for a bit until finally the button was there to start.Setting targets for weight/muscle/fat% was a bit confusing, but a simple Google search led to some clarity, and even that's set up now with my first 2 week goal. Use the watch to scan for body composition, and then step on a scale and record that to get your starting numbers... then there's a button to add a target. It would be nice to be able to set up several targets at once, but will have to revisit and set those small goals or just set a larger goal and watch progress as you go.  I set only the weight as target and it adjusted the rest to match up. If you try to enter all 3 manually, you're likely to get an error because it doesn't quite match up between the 3 figures. Pick one and done!So, yes... only a few hours in, but these are the highlights I noticed in my excitement to share... so many clock faces available, so many customizable settings for each of the faces as well... FB was only just really getting to this point. Be wary, they're not all free... but there are more than enough free ones, and the ones I saw for a price, were 0.49 and 0.99 - definitely manageable if it's a must have!I'll have to revisit this review as I get more acquainted and find more pluses and minuses!PS - size... since I was going with the Classic, I hoped as I ordered the 43mm would be big enough for my aging eyes - and yes, it is perfectly fine! I'm actually thankful I did not go with the 47mm, because this one is just perfect. I do not have petite arms, but I do have smaller wrists, and it looks just fine.  I would say, if you're very petite, and/or dainty... the regular 6 in the smaller of the 2 options is probably better. But I wouldn't go with the 47mm unless you really have a larger arm or it really may seem too big/bulky.Definitely glad I bit during the pre-order!"", ""I am overall very happy with the 44mm Watch 6, it is comfortable, non-obtrusive, and stylish when I want it to be.I am very glad I didn't get the version with the rotating bezel, because this sleeker version provides the same functionality if you simply rotate your finger around the edge.The band that it comes with is comfortable.The sleep function works very well, and provides what I consider valuable and actionable insights.The pulse oximeter is slow and intermittent.The ECG function is nice, if somewhat redundant if you're relatively healthy; you always get 'Sinus Rhythm'. I suppose if you get anything else, you should see your doctor, but I would imagine that's a one time thing.The stress function is useful and appears to be accurate.The Samsung health app is good, but not as flexible as one may desire with a watch of this capability.Battery life is pretty terrible, if you are constantly monitoring pulse, and turn on features that are the reason why you purchased this watch, (advanced sleep, always on display, etc.) you should expect no more than 24 hours of battery.The upside is that it recharges in about an hour.The blood pressure capability is not functional, it would be nice if Samsung provided some guidance as to when it will be available.  I was shocked to find, after purchasing, that it didn't work, even though it says it's supported, and currently works on the Watch 5.Without the critical BP function, combined with the battery life and sketchy SpO2 sensor, it is still a pleasurably useful watch own, likely the best available as of this review.But it's not five stars."", ""Love it. It is super responsive and looks sleek. I wish I would've gotten a s/m as the m/l but that is my own fault for not measuring wrist before hand. Sleep tracking is good too. They need to improve treadmill walking if you have your hands on the handle bars. It doesn't track accurately."", ""Huge upgrade from my old Samsung Active 2 which finally bit the dust when water managed to work its way inside and destroyed it. Watch is more customizable than before and I'm loving it all over again."", ""Pre ordered this watch and was not disappointed.  It's fast, responsive, and a huge upgrade from my last galaxy watch. Only gripe about this watch is that i can't get all the cool watch faces the old ones had. Would like to see better support or in the future add samsung galaxy store on this thing so i can get the old watch faces back. Overall great watch!"", 'Este es el 2do reloj de galaxy. Y la mejora es impresionante: más rapidez, calidad de los materiales, mejor acabado, mejor vista de la pantalla... en general estoy contento y satisfecho con mi compra.', 'Works well, flawless connection w Pixel 7 ProHave to charge everyday,but works perfect', 'The Galaxy watch 6 classic is a very nice smart watch. Maybe not the go to watch for real fitness buffs but definitely a great option for the average person that is looking for phone connectivity and some decent apps for fitness. The rotating bezel is really nice. It is smooth and it is fast! This watch reacts very quickly and the display is gorgeous. If only the battery would last a bit longer. If you use it a lot or have a bunch of functions running all the time then expect a day and a half, tops! But that doesn’t really bother me since it does recharge fast! If you are looking for a good everyday smart watch this ,Amy be “the one”.', 'Not had watch long. But like the easy start up.', ""I have had this device for maybe 6 hours and the band immediately broke. Said included band is made from a soft silicon and the metal clasp that latches the band to your arm cut through the silicon and came out when i was adjusting the fit. Granted I have thicker wrists and was having trouble getting it to sit comfortably (thanks dad). Additionally, the device does not come with a charging pack, it comes with a charging cable which has a male usb c to a wireless/QI charger. Meaning that you need some sort of converter or a charging device that uses a USB C female connector. Or you can charge it via your phone, which is what I ended up doing. The device itself worked fine otherwise, but is currently unusable without a latching band. Battery life did run down a lot quicker then I was expecting it to but I've been playing with it since I got it, so I think that might have been the reason.""]"
No ASIN,"SAMSUNG Galaxy Watch 6 40mm BT,Gold",Smartwatches,S$273.27,https://www.amazon.sg/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-Watch-40mm-Gold/dp/B0C78ZR22C/ref=sr_1_145?qid=1695864502&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051%2Cp_72%3A6469119051%2Cp_36%3A10000-90000&rnid=6450031051&s=electronics&sr=1-145,https://www.amazon.sg/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-Watch-40mm-Gold/product-reviews/B0C78ZR22C/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,4.1,"['I have used two fitness trackers in the past: the Fitbit Charge 2 and the Fitbit Versa 2. I will compare the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 to the Fitbit Versa 2, since it\'s the only other smartwatch I have used. I tried the watch with two different Samsung Galaxy smartphones: the S22 Ultra and the Z Flip 5.Pros:- Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has a beautiful, wide-enough display. It was the biggest reason I could never go for a Watch 4 or 5.- 2 side buttons with different customizable shortcut options.- It has both a microphone to dictate text messages, e-mails, commands, etc. AND a loud speaker. You can play back YouTube Music, for example, without bluetooth earbuds.- It has Wi-Fi, so it can connect to your network instead of just your smartphone, which helps with downloading / streaming.- Temperature sensors which can aid better cycle tracking (ovulation timing, etc.)- The watch can consistently charge up an extra 55% in 30 minutes. Great for quick morning or evening routines.- If you have a Samsung Galaxy smartphone with wireless power sharing features, you can place this watch on the back of your smartphone to charge up if you don\'t have the watch charger with you and need a top up. If you do have the watch charger, you can plug it into any USB-C smartphone or tablet and pull charge there.- Unlike Fitbit Pay, there are more banking and credit card partners that work in both Google Wallet and Samsung Pay.- You can control playback on your smartphone with the watch.- GPS tracking for long walks and hiking provides a map, similar to Fitbit.Cons:Unfortunately, every Pro also has a con with this watch!- While there is fast charging, the battery life is 24 hours at best. Fitbit Versa or Sense users--be prepared! I turned on the Sleep tracking feature and lost 15% overnight! I charged the watch up to 100% at 6:30 am and by 9:00 pm I was at 34% (Wi-Fi, Location, Bluetooth and NFC were turned on, and I used NFC to set up several credit cards in Samsung Pay). If I turned most of these off, where\'s the appeal in a smartwatch?- I initially set up the Galaxy Watch 6 on the S22 Ultra, and it was so confusing. First, I needed to set up the watch in an app called Galaxy Wearable, then I needed to install Samsung Health to get fitness and wellness tracking, but finally I needed Samsung Health Monitor to use the ECG feature of the watch! Of course, each of these apps has its own T&C, privacy policy and profile set ups required!- Samsung Health is presumably made by a Korean company which uses the metric measuring system, but  I can only enter in glasses of water in U.S. 8 fluid ounce increments. I understand I purchased the watch in the U.S., but it\'s poorly thought out. They should turn on the ability to track food and water intake in metric units, like Fitbit.- The first time I did the ECG test, I had to place 2 fingers on the two different buttons. Three days later, I went to the ECG test again, and had to go through another policy agreement screen and then was told to only use 1 finger. No idea why this has changed. Some information about how it works vs. before would be interesting.- The watch cannot sync your sound settings with your Galaxy smartphone. If I am in a quiet space and put my phone on Silent, the watch cannot sync that setting. I have to manually go into the watch\'s control panel and put it on silent. If you use the Modes and Routines function of Samsung\'s One UI 5, you\'ll know how convenient it is to use Location or Wi-Fi connections to stipulate if your phone should be on silent! Connected to library wi-fi? = phone silent. At home = phone vibrate+sound.  If this watch could sync with the smartphone, it\'d be truly ""smart.""- I feel that the Galaxy Watch 6 overstates my level of activity. It feels like I get a trophy just for puttering about. I walk around the office here and there for 2 minutes and by the time I get back to my desk to leave at the end of the day, it says I\'ve reached my level of activity for the day?? Fitbit is more drill sergeant in that regard--I need to actually be moving for a consecutive amount of time and energy level for it to register as ""exercise/workout."" No freeby trophies.- I had to figure out through complex swipes how to stop my walking workout--it was not intuitive. The Fitbit uses a simple Flag as the goal icon to end the workout.- Although not fitness related, one of the big draws for this watch was the ability to use Google Wallet since some of my banks do not allow Fitbit Pay. Although Google Wallet works with manager major U.S. credit card issuers, and although one credit card in particular (Discover) could show up in my smartphone\'s Google Wallet, it just will NOT allow itself to be sent to the watch\'s Google Wallet app.This isn\'t Samsung\'s fault, I thought. So I decided to try out Samsung Pay. First, the app has to be installed and set up on the phone, which defaults to an annoying Quick Access gesture which is nearly identical to the swipe up to show all apps gesture. I tried multiple times to add the Discover card and several other credit cards, and finally was successful the 3rd time I tried to add. This is after getting multiple frozen screen prompts to Add to Samsung Pay.- The apps that are on the Watch and accompany it on the Samsung Galaxy smartphones, as ever, have English spelling mistakes littered throughout that I have never seen in my Apple Wallet or with Apple Pay. Language Localization should not be so poorly done.- Since I started with the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra but was transferring over to a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5, I decided to use the Watch > Settings > Transfer to New Phone. This app did not work. It would find the watch 6 when I had the Galaxy Wearable app open on the new Flip 5, then ask if I would agree to automatic updates (optional) - I selected NO - then next. Nothing happened. Blank white screen, and a failure notice on the watch. After 4 attempts and seeing 2 different Galaxy Watch 6 options appear in the new Flip 5\'s Galaxy Wearable app for syncing, I finally decided OK FINE I WILL DO THE OPTIONAL AUTOMATIC UPDATES -- still a blank white screen. I didn\'t want to erase and set up all over again, so I am still on the S22 Ultra. I do not know if this is a Google WearOS issue or a Samsung issue, but it was a sour experience.- Another USB-C to USB-C device with no charger brick or USB-A adapter. At the very least, a C to A adapter would have been nice and of very little weight to help bridge the hurdle to an all USB-C world.Beautiful, stylish smartwatch with a gorgeous screen is ruined by software quirks of Google WearOS and Samsung\'s fragmented health-related apps. Maybe progressive updates will fix this. Do you want to gamble $299 on a maybe?', 'I bought this kind of on a whim. I\'m usually an analog guy, but I was keen to use the fitness capabilities of a smart watch and this popped up on pre-order special. So, with that being said, my review is tailored toward the fitness aspect.TLDR: The watch is fine, but in the future I would simply get a heartrate monitor or a fitness-centric watch. Or, on the other end, I would get a top-of-the line smartwatch.1 - Samsung Health works well and provides a lot of data to your phone. It tracks your heart rate over the course of your workout and has a nice display of where your beats are in regards to various ""zones"" of cardiovascular exercise. At the end of your workout you can view your results and analyze a fair amount of data. That gets a plus from me.2 - Does not do well tracking ""active time"" when in the gym. On the watch there are three measurements taken throughout the day. They are steps, active time, and calories burned. If I spend 90 minutes lifting weights the watch does not track this as active time because ( I assume) of the rest periods in between sets.3 - Body fat analysis and tracking is hit and miss. I measure myself every day right after my morning pee and in 3 days I have gone from 13% - 7% - 14%. Obviously, it\'s best to track this stat over a longer period of time, but when the results vary so wildly from day to day I begin to question the reliability of the measurement. This is a neutral or neutral + for me. It\'s good to track over the long run, but I\'m not sure the complete accuracy.3 - The standard issue strap, when worn how I normally wear a watch, comes unclipped way too often.  The release button sits right on my wrist bone which cause the thing to come unclipped. Instructions included say to wear it higher on your wrist/forearm, but the position to look at the watch becomes uncomfortable the higher up your wrist it goes not to mention how...uncool that looks. I would not take this in the ocean, a pool, or any sort of extreme sport. Even running results in an unclipped watch. FYI: Literally as I type this paragraph I tried adjusting its position on my wrist as I write this and it came unclipped. Big Negative.4 - Sleep tracking appears to work fine, but I\'m not really sure. Neutral.5 - Watch face is customizable. I like to add pictures of my loved ones/pets on the home screen. That gets a plus.6 - Battery lasts probably 2 days? I usually charge it for an hour or two in the morning and it works fine. If you\'re on the go a lot or perhaps a little more hectic I can see battery life being an issue, but for me it\'s not really a big deal. Neutral.7 - Using apps on the watch itself is a little tricky because of the limited User Interface and the small screen. I usually start an app on my phone and let the watch record the data. Texting is pretty hard on the small screen, but it does come with a bunch of pre-loaded responses and the ability to send a voice note. If you plan on using this watch as a substitute for you phone I generally recommend against it.8 - Banking/tap-to-pay works fine, but I don\'t really use it that much.9 - Golfing apps like the Grint or 18 Birdies take too long to refresh on the watch. If you want to stand over your shot for 2+ minutes ever shot, then go for it. But I\'ve given up on using this thing as a range-finder.Anyway, I would probably not buy this again. I would look for a highly tailored fitness watch.', 'Just arrived, looks great so far, setup was quick, it paired to my phone with no problems. It\'s sleek and light, looks like I can swap in my preferred band easily, has improved health tracking over earlier models. (Edited to add after wearing it for a day: I cannot believe how much lighter and sleeker this is than my Gear 3 Classic. It\'s just lovely. And it has a pulse oximeter and hard fall detection -- meaning I might end up getting one for my mom, who needs both of those things.)But: Its charger is this little pad connected to a USB-C end. Which plugs into my laptop, sure, but I can\'t use it with any of my other charging solutions around the house/car without a female-to-female, USB-C to USB-C adapter. ""Sold separately,"" ugh. I wish they had made it USB 3.0, not USB-C. It\'s frustrating to have a fun new tech toy and have to (futz) around with charging the (dang) thing. Once I get this charging issue solved, with the adapters I just ordered, I expect it\'ll be fine and last several years, as my Gear 3 Classic did.', 'I have had this watch for a week now. I like it, it looks nice and the silicone strap is very comfortable. The battery life is not good though. I have to charge it every day. I had a Fitbit before this and only had to charge it once a week, so this is quite annoying. But other than that, I really like it.Very easy to set up and pair to your phone.If you do buy this watch, you will need to buy an adapter for the charger as it is a USB C connector. I wish I had known that before I bought the watch so I could have ordered them together. The first day I had to use my phone to charge the watch.', ""I absolutely love my new watch. I only just recieved it and set it up, but so far I'm very satisfied.The only issue I wish I would have known when I purchased it...it takes a special charger that the older version didn't require.you will need a Type C USB charger box which is NOT INCLUDED!! Wish I would have been aware when I ordered my watch. I had to run to a store to purchase this special charger before I could set up my watch. This is a biggie, they should tell people.So, beware and purchase one if you don't already own one."", 'Great watch but you have to charge it every day.', 'I like that my favorite watchface (Basic Dashboard) is still available. There are more choices of watchface backgrounds and font colors and ""complications."" Watch\'s screen area seems a little bigger and brighter. Each apps\' interfaces look updated. The watchband, which is nicely pliable, is updated with a small bar, on the underside of each strap, that you press to change it out. (I wish Samsung\'s bands were sold here on Amazon!) Note that Amazon\'s description states the watch is ""gold"" but the picture clearly shows a silver color, which is what I received. Overall, I\'m quite pleased!', 'I am pleased with this smart watch. It works great and has a long battery life.', 'Producto de muy buena calidad', ""I've owned a Fitbit since the beginning, but after my last one broke (Sense), I decided to try the Galaxy Watch. I like everything about it, except the battery life, it needs to be charged daily; but I have to charge my phone everyday, so that's just a minor issue to me. No disappointment here, I'm a fan!!""]"

It has heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, step counter, exercise workout mode and history of completed workouts. It has a stop watch, timer, and alarm. Plus some added abilities such as music remote, camera remote, relaxation mode, and more. I mean I can’t think of anything this watch has left out. It even has multiple faces you can choose from and four different languages (English , French, German, and Spanish) to choose from. Of course the regular abilities are here such as brightness level, time and date setting, etc. The band is a wonderfully soft type of plastic that hasn’t yet made my wrist sweat. They do recommend you wear your smartwatch a bit higher than you would your normal watch for a better connection to your body. From completely dead to full charge it took three hours on my regular charger plug, which isn’t super bad and they don’t recommend allowing it to over charge (so no over night charging recommended). With this ITouch Air4, there are good and bad points, however, the good out weight the bad. The above are the pluses or pros to this smartwatch, note comes the cons. The instructions are severely lacking. I mean other than telling you to peel the plastic off the back and how to plug it in, they are useless. It doesn’t tell you how to connect to any of the various apps or abilities it has and there’s absolutely no trouble shooting in them whatsoever. To get the help, it does give you an email address you can contact them with and to their credit I’ve gotten a response within a day or two. The complaint here is that this method takes a long time in completing the full setup. The last con is that there is no plug for charging it. The cord and charging disc or there, but the piece that goes into the wall from the cord isn’t. Also, you can’t use a fast charger plug for some reason. Other than these few cons (which aren’t life altering), this is a wonderful smartwatch.', 'UPDATED REVIEW ON 8/9/2023 WITH 1⭐️ RATING:Unfortunately, the watch never came back on, no matter what I tried. As heartbreaking as this may sound, since I really loved the sleek and the minimalistic design of this smart watch, but this watch is just a throwaway. I hope they’ll make an upgrade to this watch and address the battery issues, because this watch has so much potentials.ORIGINAL REVIEW WITH 4 ⭐️’s RATING FROM 7/24/2023:“I have finally chosen a smartwatch for my everyday companion, not just for working out but, also to monitor my heart rate, sleep, among others. And that is, “iTouch Air 4 Smartwatch Jillian Michaels Edition with 90 Days Membership to her Fitness App - Heart Rate, Activity and Calories Tracker, Notifications, 100+ Sports Modes, 13 Workout Metrics Points.”Unfortunately, this smartwatch has limited features compared to other smartwatches I’ve seen as this will only give you notifications when you receive text messages and calls but, you can’t text and you can’t call directly from this watch. Additionally, this smartwatch was difficult to connect with my iPhone and had to keep trying a gazillion times until it finally connected. Lastly, there is charging issue. As I’m writing this review, this watch is now completely dead, while it’s connected to the charger. I have no idea if it’s actually charging as there is no indications whatsoever like flashing light or battery meter shown on the screen that it’s charging. It’s just dead. But I’m gonna keep it on the charger overnight anyway and see if it will turn back on somehow tomorrow…With that said, while I haven’t had any luck with this smartwatch so far, but just challenges after challenges, but I gotta say, this watch is one of the best, style-wise, as the face/dial is sleek and thin and easy to read and navigate the screen, and responses to your touch almost instantly. There’s no delay unlike some smartwatches I’ve tried. Additionally, the strap is also really comfortable to wear as it is made of really soft and almost velvety, non-sticky silicone materials. Also, the tip of the strap, goes in your wrist inward instead of outward, so it is perfect for everyday and all night wear, as it doesn’t get in the way of anything.If only this smartwatch would charge and able to make calls and send text messages, this would have been my top favorite. But if calling and texting features isn’t that important to you, since this watch can pretty much do almost everything that other smartwatches can, then you will absolutely love this smartwatch!”']"

Having a smartwatch makes it so I don't have to pull out my phone or carry it around constantly. I love this watch. It is super easy to set up. The fitness aspect of it, such as keeping track of my steps and such works well. The stopwatch and alarm abilities were a pleasant surprise that i wasn't expecting, they both work well. Plus they sent me an extra band with watch. The battery pretty long especially considering I wear it all day long. Battery lasts like 3 days for me. This watch turned out to be a really great investment and I really recommend it."", 'Works as advertised and well made.! Love this watch!  I wish the app allowed another function while in an indoor exercise session like using voice control or starting\\managing music.  The watch face stays on the exercise session unless you stop it and then restart afterwards which starts the exercise stats for the session at 0 again.  Otherwise tis is the best app I have reviewed and the 3 other apps also did the same.  The watch does take a full health assessment (BP, Pulse, Blood oxygen and temperature while exercising by pressing start on your mobile phone screen app.  Very nice watch!', 'Watch was definitely worth it for the price. The setup is not the easiest, the app isn’t the best. Once you get it setup it works great. The BT however often disconnects. SMS notifications were difficult. I had everything setup correctly and still no notifications for text. I found under “notifications” on my phone, you go to “messages” and make sure the “banners” are on to receive the notifications. All in all, great watch for price.', 'First off, everyone thinks I am wearing an Apply watch! The band & location of the Power button makes it look so similar qhich I love. Just what I was looking for, and I am happy my old watch used the FitCloudPro App aswell which I love. Battery life is about 3-4days which is good enough. I am very pleased with my purchase especially as shipment was overnight and really fast.', ""Recently got this affordable smartwatch, and it's been a pleasant surprise. It tells the time, connects to my phone easily, and tracks my health stats accurately. Easy to set up and use, it's a great choice if you don't need anything too fancy like me. Perfect for gym use, and the waterproof feature is a bonus. Overall, a worthwhile purchase."", 'I got this watch for my son in his birthday. He loves how it got many apps/ games/ calculator. It has fitness app, check your heart beats/ oxygen.It even has two rubber silicone bands.It so easy to install and use.It’s 100% worth every penny paid.', 'This watch is amazing. The health features are accurate and I love the water reminder. I have gotten several compliments as this watch looks very expensive. I did have trouble with the watch and phone working together to send me text notifications. I was very impressed when I reach out to the company on Sunday that their response was so quick helping me resolve the issue. The watch is very user friendly and it is unbelievable how many features this watch has for the price . One feature the watch  doesn’t have is responding to text messages. I knew this when purchased and isn’t a deal breaker but would be nice. Also there are several watch faces to choose from even for holidays.  I  highly recommend this watch.', 'The watch is awesome though because of how affordable it is and how many features it packs. There is time, Bluetooth phone pairing and of course health tracking like steps, BP etc. the features work as advertised and they have solid endurance and performance. The watch is easy to charge, easy to setup and easy to use because of the intuitive UI. I surely recommend it if you’re not looking for something too fancy.', 'It was great my mother loves the simplicity of it is functionality and she can view the icons clearly and can easily find the right ones and select the one she wants.  Having issues with her hands snapping the strap is not difficult', ""I recently purchased a smartwatch. It has exceeded my expectations. Great watch, having almost all the features. I am using this watch with my Android phone. I can monitor all my health data (sports, steps, heart rate). The adjustable strap ensures a comfortable fit. And it's waterproof feature adds an extra layer of protection, allowing you to wear it during water-related activities. In short, it was worth buying.  If you're in search of a smartwatch that offers a range of features in an appealing design, this smartwatch is worth considering.""]"

I saw one review that couldn't get the earphones to sync with phone? I was able to do that in 2 minutes. The Bluetooth for the earphones is different from the watch. Example if the Bluetooth is call I93 than for the earphones it would I93-R and I93-L. The only knock I can have is the app it uses looks outdated and I can't put my own apps to get notifications from. For Facebook and messages it shows just the notifications, there's no way to reply to them. But as for the phone feature you can dial a number from your watch and you can speak through it as the watch has its own speaker. As for the other blood pressure, steps, blood oxygen, calories burned, blood sugar.

It's very comfortable, with a large screen and the colors are awesome.  I fell in love with the watches, I now own all 3 Orang which is a nice pastel orang, the Camouflage and the classic black.  Another thing that I like about these watches are the strap keepers keeps the band nice and snug so you won't have any excess strap dangling or moving out of place..."", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0So, I recently got my hands on the Cutwif Store Smart Watch with Earbuds, and I have to say, it\'s been ver interesting for me. As someone who\'s always on the go and loves to listen to music while working out, this device has made my life a whole lot easier.First things first, the design is sleek and modern. The 1.96"" IPS touch screen is vibrant and responsive, making it a breeze to navigate through the various functions. I was a bit concerned about the size since I have smaller wrists, but it fits comfortably and doesn\'t feel too bulky.Now, let\'s talk about the earbuds. They\'re cleverly stored on the side of the watch, which is such a convenient feature. Whenever I want to listen to music or make a call, I just pop them out and put them in my ears. The audio quality is impressive, with clear sound and good bass. The noise reduction technology works well, as I can hear the person on the other end of the call loud and clear even in noisy environments.One of the things I love about this smartwatch is its fitness tracking capabilities. The heart rate monitor, sleep tracker, and step counter have been my companions in reaching my health goals. The data is accurate and helps me keep tabs on my progress. Plus, the watch itself is comfortable to wear during workouts, and it doesn\'t feel cumbersome or get in the way.Another feature that has been a game-changer for me is the ability to store and listen to music directly from the watch. With 4GB of built-in memory, I can download my favorite songs and enjoy them without needing my phone. It\'s fantastic for those times when I want to go for a run or hit the gym without carrying extra devices. Plus, the battery life is impressive. I can go through a whole day without worrying about running out of power.Now, it\'s not all sunshine and rainbows. The user interface took me a little while to get the hang of, as it\'s not the most intuitive. It required some trial and error to figure out how to access certain functions and navigate through the menus. But once you get used to it, it becomes easier to use.In conclusion, the Cutwif Store Smart Watch with Earbuds has become an essential part of my daily routine. It combines convenience, entertainment, and fitness tracking all in one device. I no longer need to juggle multiple gadgets, and I can stay connected and motivated wherever I go. If you\'re in the market for a smartwatch with integrated earbuds, this one is definitely worth considering. It\'s made my life easier and more enjoyable, and I think it could do the same for you.', ""I would say the first thing to notice about this watch is how bulky it is, which I suppose makes sense because the earbuds have to fit inside it. It was fairly simple to pair it with my phone. The corresponding phone app really only relates to the fitness tracker options. I couldn't figure out how to play music from my phone through the earbuds, and based on the poorly translated English section of the user manual,  that may not be possible. Music from your phone can play through the speaker on the watch when in phone mode, but why not just let it play through the phone speaker? The watch does come preloaded with what appears to be pop/dance music that will play through the ear buds. I don't see any way to delete or add to that selection of music. I have not received any calls or texts since pairing it with my phone, but I'm not sure I can see myself using the watch for those functions either. Since I mostly got this watch because my Fitbit died, I'll probably still use this watch as a fitness tracker and watch.Edit: I decided to try listening to music from my phone through the watch speaker. and as I expected, it drained the battery within 5 hours. If you want the battery to last, listening to music through it probably isn't a good idea. If you're fine with having to charge it every day, go for it. Also I've noticed it's not measuring my heart rate like it's supposed to, and even when paired with my phone, it's not registering calls or text messages. I reduced my star rating because it's not performing basic functions it's supposed to perform.""]"

Google is requiring more of that these days and if you link your watch to your phone but don't give it complete access, it does reduce it's functionality/feature set. For the price though it's honestly a pretty good smart watch/fitness tracker.  The default physical features probably won't win any beauty awards.  I personally would have preferred a plain black watch without the red striping, but it's not a deal-breaker.  It tracks most if not all of the same things most of these track and is accurate enough.  The pulse oximeter is a little sensitive and requires being in optimal position to get an accurate reading.  If set to just take readings on its own, sometimes it won't get accurate readings.  But the step counter, heart rate, etc and all the things you can do with it that you can do on your phone such as SMS/text, email, calls, alerts, all work and are nice.  I don't do a lot of social media stuff, but there's functionality for that as well.  I do like the larger screen.  I'm a big guy anyways and can't tell you how frustrating it is to buy a smart watch only to discover the band is sized for kids or those with small wrists and has a band and watch face similarly small or thin.  The default face is kinda bad with not a lot of contrast between the background colors and the white text, but that's easily changed in the settings/app. So a pretty good watch for the price.  Not top of the line, but you're not paying for that either."", ""This watch has many features that I like. It's a fit watch as well as a watch that helps you manage your days. You can make and receive calls. Very convenient.  Weather options.  Dial options even music.ireally like this watch. The band is made of a soft flexible rubber. Very nice."", ""The watch is great at keeping steps, tracking exercise and letting you know when you've hit set goals. I also like the fact it has a left and right marked on the watch face so you don't have to guess which direction to place it on your wrist. It's comfortable despite being a larger watch and I've had no issues with the heartrate monitor as I have with other smart watches.However, despite not allowing access to my calls it still rings through the watch. It also refuses to let you turn off the Bluetooth. If you do it demands to be turned back on before allowing you to use the app. It also constantly asks for permissions even if you do not want to allow them on it. There is also no way to stop the watch from turning on and off when you move your wrist."", ""There is a lot of functionality with this smartwatch.  While it isn't on par with Samsung or Apple watches, you're also not paying $200-$400.  For less than $100, you're getting a smartwatch that will do a lot of what you want or need it to do.  Call and message notifications, weather, step counting, heart rate and other health related things.  For someone with a smaller budget or wanting a starter smartwatch, this is an option.  Unfortunately, the instructions say is isn't waterproof and don't say what IP rating it does have.  I don't want to be the one to find out the hard way.  There are many other smart watches that are waterproof, have tons of functionality and cost much less than this one.""]"

This has been an excellent smartwatch for the money. It does have some bugs but they're pretty easy to work around until it gets updated.What you're getting: the battery is amazing and charges quickly (I just throw it on the charger while I'm in the shower), the touch screen works very well (except I'd turn off the auto screen-on feature if you're going into water) and it's quite durable. The smart sport tracking works pretty well, blood oxygen and pressure work excellently (although I'd like to know how the blood pressure works), the heart rate monitor works pretty well. It's nice to be able to check texts without pulling my phone out of my pocket. I love that I can change the background, there are so many to choose from and all varied read outs, it's not just color palette swap, and they really utilize the odd screen shape. Even the included app is simple and well put together. If you work a lot of dead tree carcass like I do, you will have to occasionally take the watch off to clear the back lasers of sweat infused cellulose to restore health monitor function but that's not a flaw of the watch.What you're not getting: this is not a Garmin, there's no ABC, no gps, no tap pay or independent wifi communication. Although abc would be a nice addition, I'm fine without the rest. No solar recharge, although with the battery you don't need it. You're also not getting a watch that plays games, you can't text (you can read recent texts though) no James bond voice chat from it, and you can't take pictures or video call (although the is a handy remote control to use your phone camera).The bugs: I only include this in hopes that they fix it. First and most glaring bug is that often times when you scroll down to read old texts or additional information after a workout the watch will crash. On the positive, the phone is back online in 20 seconds or less and only takes a little more time to catch up heart rate.Second bug is a minor inconvenience, watch doesn't seem to communicate with phone specifically on sleep monitor. Everything else is good though, so it's kind of odd.The last one, I don't know if this is a bug or just an inconvenience to me, sometimes the heat rate monitor isn't the most accurate and I have to move the watch around to find a sweet spot. I can't say of this is normal for smart watches or not."", ""UPDATE:  6 weeks in. This is the best watch I've ever owned. Im not a fitness freak I'm a Gardner, a hiker and a hot spring finder. The watch face is very durable I've hit it so many times not a scratch. Ive worn it into deep hot water no issue. Works great high up or low down. I love this watch...highly recommend. This is a great heavy duty watch. Seems to keep accurate data. The charge lasts a long time. I've gone 6 days without charging it and then it charges very quikly.. I like the watch Update .I really like this watch. I didn't charge for 10 days. Still said 65% charge remaining."", 'I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and they are many things I love and one nitpick.things I like:1 The weight. It is light, I almost dont know it is there.2 The size.  It is the exact width of my wrist to the point where the band wraps around with no bulge or singage.  the size also allows me to do stuff like pushups and it never digs into my hand like other watches.3 The looks.  It has this sort of Si-Fi look to it that makes me smile.4 The accuracy.  I have tested the heart rate on this with a real heart rate monitor and it is with in the margins of error.5 The Battery.  I had this off the charger for an easy 3 days and even with workouts and the AOD it still had enough charge to go a day without a workout.Now the nitpick.  I am left handed, so I wear the watch on my right.  when I wear a watch I have this twitch that every now and again I shake my right hand, dont know why I just do.  It does not always add a step but I have noticed it add one or two each time.  Like I said it does not happen all the time so it is just a nitpick.Over all I recommend it.  The 4 star for accuracy is only because of that one or two extra step part.', ""This is a nice watch only thing I don't like is it's time between charging it only lasts less then a week but it does everything well. I would buy it again if necessary."", 'The X1 is my new favorite fitness watch, the only one I remember to wear everyday due to its features. The rectangular screen is my favorite form factor due to how it hugs my wrists. The exercises I do require some wrist flex, so its important my fitness watch is not too wide. It is also water resistant so I can shower with it on. I rely on the watch for its sleep tracking features (records R.E.M, deep, and light cycles of sleep + duration) so I can track my day-to-day sleep habits. There is also a menu of useful features (local weather, activities modes for exercises, and even vibrate features to find your phone).', 'I bought this watch for my son, who needs a HR enabled watch that does NOT require a phone to set up. I just received the watch yesterday so have no data about how durable it is, or how long the battery will last. But I was able to set it up (time / date / face) without ever attaching it to a phone. I did not count, but it seemed like there were many faces to choose from without using the app. Quality seems high - the watch is solid.Overall, the price point seems high, but finding a reasonably modern watch that does not require a phone to set up was surprisingly challenging. The only other contender was a Casio that looks circa 1985.', 'Good product', 'I was in the market for a fitness watch to keep track of my heart rate, workout sessions, and sleep habits. The Tank X1 watch was a great choice as it has a comfortable wristband, good connectivity with my phone, and a long list of useful features.

I wouldn't buy this garbage. Save your money and spend a little more $ and get a nice smart watch."", 'todo bien gracias buen producto.', 'Watch functionality seems mediocre. I only wanted it for a custom wallpaper and text/call notification so it’s great for that. After 3 weeks of use it will now go to a black screen and not come back. It may come back randomly, but at this point it will not turn back on. Was at 80% so not a battery issue. I believe it’s a poor connection inside.', 'This watch is a piece of junk. Malfunction the second I took it out of the box.', ""This watch did impress me with it's features for it's price. It has many heath monitoring features including a blood pressure monitor that is typically missing on smart watches around this price. It has nice functionality when paired with a smart phone using it's app. Many watch faces are available to select from and some can be customized for the information you wish to have shown. Turning off the function to wake the watch when the arm moves and making it so you have to press a button to wake up makes the battery last longer and can save you from accidentally making a call while sleeping (don't ask me how I know that can happen, haha). The watch band can be changed if desired, but I had no issues with the provided band. The battery life was good with general daily usage."", 'This watch has a lot of great features that all seem to accurately work well. I would go over the entire list but it’s extensive and already listed in the product description. I will tell you the pros out weigh the cons but there are a few cons. There seems to be a connectivity issue where my phone (iPhone) is paired to this watch via Bluetooth and a few times throughout the day,  I’ll look at my watch and notice that the time is off, the weather isn’t displayed or something else. So I then go to my smartphone Bluetooth settings and see that my watch is not connected. Sometimes I can easily tap on the watch name in my Bluetooth list and it easily reconnects but sometimes I have to actually turn the watch off and back on to get the watch to pair with my smartphone.  The other con is the charger cable. It’s magnetic and clicks to the back of the watch to charge and while that’s a cool concept, the magnet isn’t powerful and so the slightest bump of the cable or watch and it disconnects from the magnetic port and stops charging.  I live on my phone unfortunately and so between calls, text messages, gps navigation, this watch can last about two days on a full charge. The watch has a nice built in microphone and speaker which has exceptional clarity. So when making a call or receiving a call, talking and listening to other people is not an issue. The music player works well and sounds great. The watch fits comfortably and seems durable. This is my first smartwatch and so I really can’t compare it to others. I like everything about it but the connectivity issue and the magnetic charger.', 'This is a nice ""smart watch"", with one big problem - the blood pressure meter reads much, much lower than a blood pressure cuff. I normally wouldn\'t rate the this low but this is a serious issue for people with acute hypertension and could mislead them into thinking their BP is fine when it\'s on the edge of congestive heart failure - something I\'ve been unfortunate enough to experience. The tiny manual is printed in about 4pt. grey characters on a glossy background and very, very hard to read. I found neither the manual nor the ""bubble"" menu to be intuitive, and struggled to get the watch synced with my iPhone although I finally got it to work.One the other hand, though, I actually like the watch and will be wearing it. Once you get through the steep learning curve initially, it grows on you, and the companion ""Da Fit"" mobile software gives you a huge variety of screen graphics and layouts. I\'ll just have to remember not to trust the BP readout.']"

Just my opinion.', ""The Alliget Smart Watch is an impressive device that pushes the boundaries of wearable technology, offering a range of benefits that make it stand out from the competition. Upon first glance, the watch presents itself with superb presentation, leaving a lasting initial impression that speaks to its high quality and attention to detail.One of the standout features of the Alliget Smart Watch is its powerful performance. The device boasts a quick and snappy response, ensuring that users can navigate through various functions effortlessly. The bright and vibrant display enhances the overall user experience, providing clear visibility even in different lighting conditions.Despite its large size, the Alliget Smart Watch manages to maintain a lightweight design, making it comfortable to wear for extended periods. What sets this watch apart is its novel approach of integrating earbuds within the device itself. This innovative feature eliminates the need for carrying separate earbuds, offering convenience and ensuring that you always have them on hand.Pairing the watch with the mobile app and your phone is a seamless process, further enhancing its user-friendliness. The watch's strong battery life is another standout aspect, as it impressively retains 90% of its charge after 24 hours of continuous use.While the Alliget Smart Watch excels in many areas, there are a few drawbacks to consider. Its large size, specifically its thickness, may not appeal to those seeking a slim and sleek design. Additionally, the placement of the crown on the opposite side can take some getting used to, leading to initial confusion and accidentally wearing the watch backward. Furthermore, the mobile app restricts users to pairing with only one device at a time, necessitating the deletion of a previous watch from the app.Another drawback lies in the covers designed to keep the earbuds in place. While they have a rubbery texture that allows for flexibility, they lack a secure latching indicator. This may result in some uncertainty about whether the earbuds are securely returned to the watch.In conclusion, the Alliget Smart Watch is an innovative and forward-thinking wearable device that comes with a few trade-offs. Although it may take some time to adapt to its unique design, the watch's novel features and smooth operation make it a compelling choice. Its appealing aesthetics and functionality continue to grow on users, making it a worthwhile investment for those looking for a cutting-edge smartwatch experience."", 'Or should I say, WRIST?  So I was ready to really beat on this watch.  However, my wife rescued me.  I am not very computer literate.  The instructions that came with this watch were basically, non-existent.  What they give you is a list of the features but HOW you access them was completely beyond me.  I could not even find a video on how to set this up.  So I gave it to my wife and I have to say, I LOVE this watch.  It\'s hard to say how many of the features I will actually use.  I love the thought of counting my steps.  I\'ve had troubles with ear buds in the past and getting a good fit but these are great.  I stream Pandora and will be using these as I do projects around the house and exercise.  I love the face, it\'s just so in your face (pun intended) in a good way.  The battery so far seems long lasting and how much life is left is right there, clear as a bell every time you see your watch.  Two funny/interesting things; the watch came with some weird time on it and I couldn\'t figure out how to ""set"" the watch.  Once you sync the watch to your phone, it will automatically change to match your phone.  Also, it took a second to realize that the displayed date is European style, in other words, the day and then month.  All good though.

The band is very comfortable and I found the installed face(s) looked great.  I currently have two Apple watches (4 and 7), so I will compare it to those to give you a better sense of how well this one worked.The overall look and feel of the watch was very nice since it looked more like a traditional watch compared to my Apple products and I liked the heft compared to the ultralight 4 and 7 that I currently use.  The faces that came pre-loaded were also quite nice, but I wasn’t too impressed with the others I could download.  They were okay, but the pre-loaded ones were definitely much nicer.  I also found it was relatively easy to navigate all the screens and the response was generally “snappy” compared to my Apple watches.  I did find it was a little slow to turn on when I raised my wrist, but other than that, I found it just as responsive as the Apple products.  The software was a bit “clunkier” than the 4/7 and I found I had to scroll through a few screens to get to what I wanted, but after I got used to the watch it got a bit easier to navigate.When it came to workouts and heart tracking, I found there was a discrepancy between the M6 and both Apple watches.  When I did some strength training, both the heartbeat monitor and calories burned were off by about 25+ units.  For example:  My Apple watch said my heartrate was 127 and the M6 was reading only 95.  The calorie burn was similar at 180 for the Apple and only 155 for the M6.  No offense to the WalkerFit, but I am going with the Apple for accuracy in both cases.  The reason for this is that I have put the Apple watches up against a chest strap and the readings were pretty much the same so I am confident in the feedback from the Apple products.Integration with my iPhone was also pretty good, but of course the Apple products worked better and were much easier to use.  Calls were actually good on the M6 and people could hear me well, but sometimes they complained about a slight echo.  The 4 and 7 both handled calls better.Overall, this is a nice watch which I liked quite a bit.  While it is not as refined or accurate as the Apple products, it is also about one quarter of the cost.  I will definitely be wearing it as a change of pace from my 4/7, but I will use the Apple watches for more accurate readings during workouts.  I am still recommending it and giving it a 4 star rating for the look and functionality, but don’t expect the same quality of a higher end watch if you decide to buy.RecommendedGood luck with your decision/purchase', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Ignoring the possibility that the color is not your cup of tea, the design of this watch is one of its key selling points. Built on a circular, masculine (and large) body with excellent fit and finish, the watch looks good, any way you look at it. It\'s very well-made, with lots of interest and details, good transition between parts and materials. The speaker is well-integrated with a neat-looking oblong grill, and the bezel is nicely chamfered... I\'m not sure about the ""WATCH"" written on what appears to be a lanyard attachment point, but it\'s at least well-executed. The band is fine, but isn\'t very comfortable. It\'s fairly easy to swap out, however.This watch has a screen that is higher resolution than most budget watches, and the performance is quick and responsive. So far, it\'s the closest I\'ve found to a name-brand experience (and the price reflects that).Given the pricepoint of a third (or fourth) the cost of a name-brand smart watch, here\'s what you\'re compromising:First of all, aesthetics and build quality is about 90% of the name brand.Secondly, screen resolution is about half to on-par, and performance is between a third to half the performance. For the most part, performance is 100% commensurate, given that the tasks you perform daily aren\'t necessarily performance hogs. While the processor, connectivity, and other technical components of the high end name brand are better, you won\'t actually notice the difference.The audio quality is the speaker on the watch is excellent, and it definitely feels 100% as good as the name brand.Now, lastly, is the part where the watch starts to let us down, and that\'s the software that supports it. I\'ve used da fit on other watches and while it does some basic functions adequately well, it is a closed system, meaning that the watch isn\'t given room to be ""smart"". You can\'t download and install apps, you can\'t really customize the experience, there are SO MANY BUGS. often, you will be stuck looking at blank items or try to activate features that simply don\'t end up activating or working. Even worse, the watch face inventory - while a small step up from the worst of them - is incredibly buggy and slow, and shows all of the screens in an incredibly limited infinite list that often stops working, entirely (see the screenshots).While there are some decent faces (two of the include ones even have sweep seconds) the vast majority of screens are derisable (how many soccer-themes screens does anyone need?) and the ""make your own"" screen really misses out as it doesn\'t include analog hands or truly custom controls.In the end, this watch is excellent. It\'s well-made, with impressive technical specs for its price. With a better support software interface and some more mature and desirable watch faces, it could be one of the budget smart watch kings of the hill.', 'Easy to figure out, app is simple to get, offers many options for free downloadable watch faces, strap is meh but fits a big wrist.', ""I tried the WalkerFit M6 now for a week. Prior I tested the WalkerFit M2 for $99. I must say, the WalkerFit M6 is superior except for the strap.The smartwatch gives you plenty of features and the connectivity to your phone is great via the app.The measuring isn't always super accurate though. That is to expect in this price range. Sometimes it takes 2-3 tries to get the right pulse or blood pressure and sometimes it is way off.The step counter is very accurate though.Compared to the Walkerfit M2, the 6 seems a little more accurate and also bigger. I don't like the orange straps. Good for sport but gives the watch a weird look. I will put a different strap in the future.Decent budget smart watch with okay app support. Would take the M6 over the M2 and change the strap."", 'The watch is acceptably well designed. If you are a person who is not used to changing digital watch faces then you will like it.

Not many for digital faces. Only the one with the skull and two more and the others, well, they are not very attractive to use.In general terms the watch is fine. Does its job well. I would love to see WearOS on it.', ""Very good quality for the price . The app is so user friendly and has many useful gadgets . Takes seconds to be connected and ready to use . Looks cool as a Samsung Watch . The messages coming in letters other than latin letters can be read which is a great plus over others .

Maybe you feel you don\'t need Alexa, but consider that the ""Events"" app on the watch also doesn\'t actually exist in the Mi Fitness app. So if you want to use Alexa + your calendar as a workaround, that\'s still going to require you constantly re-syncing. Okay, say you don\'t care about editing your calendar at all-- but this affects your notifications as well, and you\'ll constantly either be missing or getting duplicates.The instructions for giving it permission to run in the background just don\'t work. I don\'t necessarily even blame Xiaomi for this, maybe it\'s my phone that\'s at fault for being too strict. If you look online, you\'ll see it\'s a fairly common issue with all of the working solutions being for Xiaomi phones. The solution for other phones of ""turn off adaptive battery for Mi Fitness"" does not work.The activity tracking works fine (minus requiring manually syncing), but if you just want activity tracking, there\'s plenty of cheaper fitness trackers, even from Xiaomi.

This is a huge plus as he is rough on everything. So far so good!!! The battery life is amazing!! He wears it for literally days before it needs a charge. He also now cares how many steps he gets in daily. Crazy how something so small can make such a difference in what someone does."", ""This watch is larger than I expected on my wrist but I'm getting used to it. The battery life is absolutely amazing.

I've tried another band (22mm) and also worn it on the inside of my wrist with mixed results (maybe it's just me.)

Shipping was super fast and after I got it I played around with and used it at work for a few days sofar and I am jaw dropped first day got jammed in a truck door with my wrist and it didnt scratch break or anything. The watch functions better than even the their amazon sales ad states, its super responsive I didnt get any lag. It was easy to connect and it looks straight up badass!!! If you work a hands on manual labor job this is the one for you. To be honest if you do anything this one will work just fine its a great device and for the price its a no brainer definitely worth the low risk!', 'Just had heart surgery and it helps me to monitor most everything I need', 'This is a very well made smart watch and easy to use. I purchased the item and once received I put it on and I haven’t taken it off yet. I still have yet to charge it since I got it and it’s still has plenty of life left. I love the features it has with checking my heart rate , keeping track of my work outs and I can even change the music on my phone. The only down side I would say is that I can’t make phone calls but I can see my text messages on my watch. Great watch over all , I would definitely recommend this watch for anybody.']"

Con una valutazione a 4 stelle, ritengo che questo orologio abbia molto da offrire in termini di funzionalità e stile.Innanzitutto, il design dell'orologio è semplice ma sofisticato. La sua cassa in acciaio inossidabile conferisce un aspetto premium, mentre il cinturino in pelle è confortevole da indossare e si adatta bene al polso. L'orologio è leggero e non ingombrante, il che lo rende ideale per un uso quotidiano.Dal punto di vista delle funzionalità, il Xiaomi Watch S1 Pro offre diverse opzioni interessanti. Ha un monitoraggio continuo della frequenza cardiaca che mi è risultato accurato e affidabile durante le mie attività fisiche. Inoltre, è dotato di un GPS integrato, che è estremamente utile per tenere traccia delle distanze percorsi durante le sessioni di allenamento all'aperto.L'orologio è anche resistente all'acqua, il che lo rende adatto per l'uso durante le attività sportive o sotto la doccia. Tuttavia, devo notare che non è completamente impermeabile e non è consigliato per l'immersione in acqua profonda.La durata della batteria è decente. Con un uso moderato, sono riuscito a far durare l'orologio per circa 2-3 giorni prima di doverlo ricaricare. Non è eccezionale, ma considerando le funzionalità che offre, non è del tutto deludente.Un aspetto che potrebbe essere migliorato è il software dell'orologio. L'interfaccia è intuitiva, ma ho riscontrato alcune piccole lentezze e ritardi nelle risposte. Inoltre, l'offerta di app e watch face è ancora limitata rispetto ad altri smartwatch presenti sul mercato. Tuttavia, mi aspetto che Xiaomi continui a migliorare il software con gli aggiornamenti futuri.Nel complesso, il Xiaomi Watch S1 Pro è un orologio elegante e funzionale che offre molte caratteristiche interessanti. Il design è raffinato, le funzionalità come il monitoraggio della frequenza cardiaca e il GPS sono utili per le attività sportive, e la resistenza all'acqua è un vantaggio. Tuttavia, ci sono alcune aree in cui potrebbe essere migliorato, come la durata della batteria e il software.

I'd ordered a cheaper fitness-type tracker before and he didn't like the set up. This watch is fairly easy for a senior not tech savvy to set up or link. However, he is also not one to use all the abilities this watch suggests. I've noticed, however, he does wear it consistently and was surprised when it alerted him to calls and notifications. I was particularly interested in his tracking his blood pressure and heart rate, which he does use to check. I think we compared his readings to his cuff once or twice and it was fairly close. He likes that he can easily see/read the watch face. Very bright and colorful. He used it until he thought it might need to be recharged, but hooking it up indicated it still had almost a full battery! I keep encouraging him to find other applications and hope he'll continue to explore the watch's capabilities. In the meantime, seeing him wear it is encouraging for me.Update: 5/19 Hubby wore the watch daily until the strap broke.

It is also nice that it displays the temperature. I would recommend this watch to a friend!', 'My most favorite thing I’ve ordered from here ever.

At the time of writing this review It uses the ""VeryFit"" app, which should be available for all smartphones. The watch and app are both from a Chinese company.This watch has phone features, including a speakerphone, which I did not test.WHAT IS GOOD?The watch has a really nice look and feel. The screen is bright and sharp. The screen is easy to read and understand.- The touch screen is responsive but I didn\'t find it to be overly sensitive. I haven\'t activated a feature accidentally due to an over sensitive touch sensor.- Battery life is fantastic. I charged it twice in two weeks. FIrst on the day I received it, and again about a week later.  The battery seem to last about a week with normal use. The description says 7-25 days.  I\'d say that is 7 days with typical use, and 25 days if it was on the shelf and not worn.  I think that if you used the sport tracking a lot then you might get a little less life between charges.- There is a mic and speaker in the watch so you can take calls from the watch.  The mic is pretty decent and you can hear pretty clearly.  You can also dial number from the watch.- The heart rate and SPO2 monitoring appear to be accurate. The watch can continuously monitor heartrate throughout the day.- You can set reminders for drinking water.- There is a large selection of watch faces you can switch between. Some faces allow you to use your own images in them. I found that the app was a bit slow loading the faces.- You can shake/rotate your wrist to wake the watch to check the time. No touching or pressing needed.- There are a LOT of fitness activities you can choose from to track. The tracking metrics are simple but nice to have. A really nice feature is you can use the app to change which activities are on the watch and in what order they show up.- The step counter is OK during my testing. It doesn\'t counts steps when I am driving, which is great if you want to count steps for daily fitness goals.- The watch syncs its data to the app with good consistency. During my testing I didn\'t find a time when the app didn\'t update data from the watch.- The watch tracks sleep patterns, including REM, deep, and light sleep. I have only tracked this for a few days, but it seems to be more accurate than other devices.  From my understanding of how these devices track sleep, they are all a bit off, but some are more inaccurate than others.- There is no GPS in the watch. This is great for people who don\'t want their location tracked at all times. If you are looking for this feature to track routes then this could be a deal breaker.- The watch has fitness tracking modes for watersports and swimming, but I haven\'t tested this feature. I also have not worn it in the shower.  I have rinsed it off a couple times and it didn\'t have any issues.Once the watch is connected to the app, set up is easy. I didn\'t see a paywall or additional fees to use all of its features. The app doesn\'t have the biggest set of features but they all seem to be available at no additional charge. The app runs in the background all the time, but I didn\'t see any real impact on my phone\'s battery life. I am testing the Android version of the app.Initial set up was easy. Once I had the Da Fit app installed, set up was very simple and quick for me, including syncing it to my phone. You can set up which features and screens you want available via swiping. There are shortcuts on screen to get to the primary features you want to use.The watch band has a lot of holes in it so I am able to adjust it to a comfortable snugness - I can get a good fit.WHAT IS NOT SO GOOD?The watch has a few issues, which may or may not be a deal breaker for you:- It has a Blood Pressure feature, and it is more accurate than other watches I have tested and reviewed.  On most of the fitness trackers I have found this to be a completely useless (with measurements WAY off from a calibrated monitor), but on this watch it seems to be a bit better.  I have found it to be more accurate when the watch is worn more snugly.  I wish the software allowed for calibrating this feature- The watch can show notifications for your email, messages, and several of the more common social media apps. This is a positive, except for the ""Other"" category. The Other category will send notifications for ALL other apps you use, and you can\'t pick and choose which.VERDICTIf you are looking for a smart watch with decent fitness tracking and great battery life, then this may be the watch for you. If are looking for more advanced fitness tracking then you might want to consider other options.', 'The tongue on the buckle protrudes and irritates my arm, I ordered a different strap.', 'When I recieved watch I fully charged, then downloaded app to my phone.

For $99, I think the watch is way overpriced for the number of features and functionality you are getting.Here are the issues I have with this watch:1. The watch advertises a 60-day battery life. However, true battery life is approximately 5-6 days under minimal usage and the lowest brightness (i.e. if you look at the watch a few times a day with some notifications coming through).2. The intelligent recognition function works very poorly. On both bike rides and walks, I would say the intelligent detection functions work less than 10% of the time, and when it does, it usually alerts you to start when you are done or almost done with the activity.3. The watch can never seem to get an accurate HR reading when I am exercising. During my walks or bike rides, the HR reading usually drops from ~85 bpm to 50-60 bpm, when the bpm is closer to 130-140. The only way for the watch to read properly again is by taking it off, cleaning the sensor and my skin, and then putting it on again. I am guessing the problem is due to sweat blocking the sensor from reading the skin properly, although it doesn\'t take a lot of it to make the sensor very dirty. I found that even if I don\'t exercise, I have to take the watch off at least once a day to keep cleaning the sensor for it to return proper values. Furthermore, the range for HR in the app was 0-200, so daily variations in your HR are just seen more or less like a flat line with small bumps on it. Visualizing changes throughout the day is very difficult since the graph\'s Y-axis doesn\'t move with your actual HR, but instead is fixed to a maximum of 200.4. Exercise by other means does not seem to change the mileage on the watch or affect the number of calories burned. If you are exercising by means other than walking, the calorie number is going to be grossly inaccurate. The watch also does not have a GPS so the mileage reading is based on the number of steps taken rather than the distance traveled. Shaking your legs while sitting down will on occasion increase the step counter.5. The weather function does not work. The watch just says ? and the app keeps giving an error about it not being able to find the weather information.6. The blood oxygen values appear to be bogus. Even applying a tourniquet to the arm, the watch will continue to return fluctuating values between 97-99%, even when a fingertip pulse oximeter will keep beeping that the blood oxygen has dipped to ~85%.7. The way the watch delivers notifications is fairly clunky - the font itself is a bit large and the font face looked a bit unusual. Larger notifications like emails tend to be truncated and there isn\'t a good way to be reading the entire message on the watch. There is also no way to interact with the notifications, where your only action is to delete the notification. It is also a bit difficult when dismissing multiple notifications although you can dismiss all of them at once.8. The watch comes with a screen protector out of the box, but applying the screen protector on causes a significant decrease in touch sensitivity. Scrolling through will often miss, and you often have to press things twice for the action to register properly. (e.g. it would be impossible for you to use the calculator on the watch if you tried to use it with the screen protector on, but it is already difficult enough to use without a protector).9. Sleep tracking only works once a day. If you take naps during the day, these naps won\'t be registered on the app or the watch.10. While the watch can take HR/blood ox readings periodically, it doesn\'t seem like it takes these values consistently. It also does not have a function to take blood pressure readings periodically, although I am not sure how accurate these values are. I am guessing this may also be related to #3 where the sensor may get dirty since many times the HR reading just goes -- or return a bogus value after wearing it for more than 12 hours.11. The charger feels cheaply made and is somewhat bulky. The magnet itself is weak so you have to fumble around with the watch to get it to align and stick to the charger pins. Since the magnet is weak, moving the watch slightly can cause it to stop charging. The watch does not allow you to interact with it while charging.12. Although the watch has smartphone-like menus, the UI is somewhat hard to use and there are very limited customizations you can do. For example, instead of allowing you to press in the exact number of minutes for a timer, you have to keep scrolling through the values until it lands on the specific minute you want. Also, the scrolling seems like it always scrolls ~2-3 items at a time regardless of the ""fling speed"", so setting a 55-minute timer will require you to keep scrolling back and forth before you can complete the task. The calculator has tiny buttons that are impossible to use even if you have small fingers. There aren\'t any addons/apps you can download, and the major customizations you can do is temperature unit (C/F) - (although the weather app does not work) and the wallpaper.13. It is quite difficult to activate the watch by flinging your wrist forward. Sometimes the action registers, sometimes it doesn\'t. Because the watch would only stay on for a max of 15 seconds, it is somewhat of a pain to keep track of your activity when you are exercising. If you are trying to reach a particular HR, you will have to keep pressing the button to reactivate the watch face when the screen turns off. Reading the watch while riding a bike can be difficult because the watch does not have a very good reading angle and can really only be read directly and under lower light situations (bright sunlight makes the watch very difficult to read without bringing the watch very close to your face).14. The Do Not Disturb function does not sync with your phone and needs to be enabled separately on the watch. This means that if you decide to wear the watch at night, application notifications will continue to vibrate the watch (and potentially wake you up) even when your phone is in Do Not Disturb mode. You will have to manually set a schedule on the watch if you do not wish to receive notifications in a defined window on the watch. It seems like the function is somewhat finicky though, and sometimes the watch continues to vibrate even if the mode is turned on. It also seems like that function is prone to accidentally triggering since it only takes a swipe and press to turn on/off various functions.15. Not all settings can be configured in the app. Some of them are only available on the watch itself while others are on the app. It can be challenging to find specific settings and know where to set them.16. Even when the 12-hour (AM/PM) mode is activated, 12:00 AM is displayed as 00:00 AM. Kind of a strange way to display time, but seems like there is no way to get the time displayed properly.17. Time sync is reliant on the Bluetooth connection with the phone. This is not too surprising, although Daylight Saving Time can cause the wrong time to be displayed until the watch resyncs the time with the phone.18. If you choose to customize your wallpaper, you are forced to use a specific UI design and cannot pick from the preset designs that display information in a particular way. The fidelity of the information when using a customized design is simply not the same.19. Although the watch relies on its Bluetooth connection for many of its activities, it cannot use the device\'s address book for displaying names/numbers on the watch. Instead, you have to pick which ones you want to sync over to the watch (up to 100). Anyone who isn\'t synced over to the watch will not have their names displayed when the calling function is enabled. If you have more than 100 contacts, you will have to pick and choose whom to leave out.20. The app needs permission to be constantly running in the background for reliable notifications (which drains batteries faster). The app also requests quite a bit of permissions on the device for its activities and collects a lot of what may be deemed as sensitive information. Some of that data is transmitted without encryption to an offshore server in China, which raises privacy concerns.', ""This is the 3rd of the cheaper watches I have purchased after my Fitbit died.  I'm still tryiing to find one that I like because the Fitbit had issues also and so does the Apple.  First of all the Amazon lists this as an Amaztim.  It is actually a Kospet Tank M2 but if sold by Amazon Kospet will not honor it, so you have to go back to Amazon and the only thing they will do is replace, but I degress.  The watch is the best of the cheaper ones I have tried.  It feels good and solid on your wrist and seems rugged enough to do about anything.  The ap seems to work ok but I have not figured out how to get it to interact with Apple Health, even though it says it is connected.  The sleep ap seems pretty accurate as well as the heart rate function and the blood Oxigen feature.  I would not rely on the blood pressure function.  The weather function is pretty useless.  It will show rain when no clouds are in the sky.  In interaction with the phone seems to work ok.  It will answer calls and show texts as long as you are connected to Blue Tooth.  . You can also make calls but you can't write texts.  The watch does not have a gps chip so even when connected to the phone it will not show where you have been if you're using it for running or cycling.  As with others like this the sports function are limited.  They basically give you a count down then starts counting up while measuring your heart rate and activity level but thats about it.  The swim function is useless.  It actually stops monitoring within 20 seconds to 1 minute after you start swimming. I have let it run while not in the pool and runs continously but as soon and you get in the water and start swimming it stops.  I did complain about this to Amazon and they are sending me another watch.  If the new one works I will revise this review."", ""UPDATE 9/5/23.  I've now had to watch a month and a it a lot, particularly and mostly because of the health monitors.  I have a home nurse come in once a month and other healthcare professionals in the readings are very close to there's.  The MAJOR issue is that I still only get at best a day and 1/2 with battery life.  Well, I can live with it certainly is just a few hours more then my Samsung S3 frontier.  I guess I'm not really complaining, but do not my in to the long battery life.  It ain't happening!  I bought this thinking would be ideal with the blood pressure and oxygen monitors and some other features.  I received excellent shipping service.  But when I set it up.  I was less than satisfied.  The reason I bought to begin with his I thought I had lost my galaxy frontier smartwatch the other day.  I ha and was quite satisfied d it for three years, particularly with a range of watch faces from Matteo.  I have had the watch fully charged and now wearing it for roughly 14 hours and have 46% left on the charge.

Maybe it's just me and I expected more and maybe I'm missing some hidden secret.UPDATE 08/02/23, 9 AM.  I'm getting to better understand tank M to as I said before, the diagnostics seem to be pretty close to on point, which is very helpful for me.  The wristband is very comfortable and the app on my Samsung C4 for is really helpful.  My concern the battery charge.  I fully charged.  It at 4 o'clock on Tuesday 08/01, and it is now 9 o'clock on 08/02 and I have 57% battery usage.  I'd be lucky to get probably a day and 1/2.  Am I doing something wrong visit need to set in with use?  I can live with it, but it's not what it was sold for.  But I am getting happier with it at this point.  Thanks for your feedback, Al."", ""As of the latest update - the app Kospet now communicates with the Apple Health app which is great.aso of right now: ALL of my notifications show up on the watch! Thanks to excellent customer service!Even some of my obscure medical alert apps like medicine apps, and notifications from Alexa that my AC was changed etc. EVERYTHING. Instagram, Facebook, EVERYTHING!Updated . Amaztim is the absolute best customer service! Overall this has been a FANTASTIC experience. Now to the watch:the Sleep function is the ABSOLUTE BEST I have ever seen in a smart watch! this is critical for me. It is literally within minutes of the manual sleep tracking app I use on my phone. NEVER EVER wrong!I hope the app is updated to correct the notification issues. This is still my FAVORITE watch out of many I've tried!UPDATE 22 JULY 2023I bought this on May 12.As of right now, I have 7 watches and this is the only one I wear. I'm addicted to the fact that the alarm sounds on the watch in the morning. That's FAR better than a vibration anytime.Sleep function is the ABSOLUTE BEST I've ever seen in any smart watch! WOW!so my 5 star rating stands!I purchased this mainly because I need to track my sleep ACCURATELY. My first night sleep - and it did FANTASTIC! I use a manual sleep tracking app on my phone that i have to start and stop. The watch was within a couple of minutes of that time! WOW! I'm impressed with the sleep tracking capability for the first night!  This is my preliminary. I may come back and update.The watch faces are many, but many just seem like iterations of the same old thing with just different patterns. There are no other watch faces like the stock face, with all the various readouts and being able to tap on those.The Band: the band is a little difficult to put on and get it tight.  For the bodily readings it has to be tight.I have noticed that it does not send ALL app notifications to my watch from my iPhone 12. there are multiple notifications on the phone that don't come to the watch. This is annoying.Next: The screen protector:  I tried several times to put it on. Each time it would look as if it had water under half of it, so I tried again. eventually it snapped at the corner and I had to dispose of it. Guess it wasn't very strong to begin with.Setup was easy. It takes a little time to get to know the functions and locations of things, menus etc. but it's not difficult (lol yes I have a PhD).this is 24 hours. Let's see the battery life: let's see how it holds up to normal wear. I don't exercise. I don't do manual labor. I'm 100% disabled so it should hold up to me without any issue.Update - three days in. and the sleep tracking is phenomenal!!  It just stinks that it doesn't sync with Apple health so I'm looking for a work around. problem is this app doesn't share data with ANYTHING else so it may not be possible.  Hey Amaztim - UPDATE YOUR APP!"", 'I have only just activated my watch and would have used it for less than one day. I am fully satisfied with the wide range of activities and look forward to great enjoyment.', ""I have been really impressed with the watch and Amaztim!  Before I even received the watch I had a message  thanking me for the purchase with a contact for any questions.  I received the watch which has worked perfectly and met my expectations.  I had an operational question so I responded to the message and within an hour had a response back that walked me through what I needed to do.  I've had several watches and not only is this watch my favorite and company is amazing to work with!"", 'I really like the design and features of the watch. The best thing about this watch is that I can track my fitness progress like heartbeat, exercise, and distance easily and later save the data smoothly to check my progress daily. Also, I can quickly receive my calls, and text messages when my phone is not around and it is great value for the money.', 'I like the watch for the price.  The charger has two pins. One pin broke. It needs a more aturde charger', 'The product has lot of features which probably makes it pricey. Looks good and stands out on the wrist.Battery life is shorter than advertised. Unsure yet about HR, oxygen etc accuracy. Overall, it’s a okay product .', 'Very happy with the watch itself.  It has all the features that I wanted in a watch.Even the mobile app itself is pretty fairly decent.  It will not sync with google fit, which would definitely be an added feature.

Battery life is several days, so that is good as well.  Pulse oxygen, heart rate, steps, etc. all seem reasonably accurate.  It is easy to operate, looks good, works well, so overall I am impressed.BUT, while the manufacturer offers tons of watch faces to choose among, most of them are cutesy cartoons, Xmas trees, and other stuff I am not remotely interested in.  This is a smart watch, it collects data.  I want to display the data, preferably all on one or at most 2 screens.  The minimum data I want at hand is:1.  time2.  day and date3.  steps4.  pulse5.  weatherThere are a few watch faces that have most of this data, but the design lacks a lot.  I found one acceptable version after going through the entire catalog several times.  And, the watch memory itself surprisingly can only hold a few faces, so when you add one another one disappears.  Not optimal.  And you cannot add (apparently) other programs, unlike Samsung and some other brands.Overall pretty good, particularly given the price, but just a little design effort to provide data-based watch faces instead of silly ones would help immensely.', 'Hard to set up but once complete the watch works fine.

This one is pretty big on my wrist and I'm far from being a little guy. I guess it works like it should. I've never had one like this before. It's advertised as always on, but mine goes blank after a couple of seconds, but that is probably because I haven't found the correct setting yet. When I turn my wrist, the display light up immediately, so no big deal...battery life may be better that way. It does have a lot of faces that can be installed or downloaded. There are a lot of functions on this watch. I could go on and on, but for a smart watch that doesn't cost a fortune, it has way more features to offer than I would probably ever use, but who knows, as I get more proficient with it, I may try more features. I did answer the phone from the watch and could hear and talk to it...kind of weird sensation-I felt Like Dick Tracy. It looks nice and the band is quite comfortable too. So far, the battery life is good. I get several days of use between charges and it does charge pretty dang fast too. I like it, I think I'll keep using it.""]"

Erstmal ein billiges Teil, um Erfahrung zu sammeln.Ich habe die Uhr nun zwei Stunden und kann nichts zur Zuverlässigkeit schreiben.Pro:- mit 30 Euro sehr günstig- Gehäuse und Armband wirken wertig, auch wenn's nur ein Gummiarmband ist- kann man schnell mit der App verbinden und andere Ziffernblätter runterladen- Alle Gesundheitsdaten kann man am Handy und der Uhr ablesen- Touch-Display funzt einwandfreiContra:- Man kann den Musikplayer mit der Uhr starten und einen Titel vor oder zurückgehen, die Lautstärke einstellen. Es ist aber nicht möglich die Wiedergabe zu pausieren. Für mich völlig unverständlich.- Stoppuhr und Timer laufen nicht im Hintergrund. Wenn man zur Uhrzeit wechselt, stoppen die Zähler- Fünf Ziffernblätter sind auf der Uhr fest gespeichert. Nur eins aus dem Store wird hinzugefügt.Man kann sich also in der Uhr keine zusätzlichen speichern, sondern muss die immer neu runterladen. Den meisten vielleicht Wurscht, aber ich würde halt gern schnell und ohne Ladezeit wechseln. In der App hat man aber seinen Bereich in dem alle runter geladenen Faces gelistet sind.- Keine always-on Funktion für das Display... hätte ich gern- Man kann einstellen, wie lange das Display an ist. Allerdings nur für den Fall, dass man es mit dem Knopf an der Seite einschaltet. Wenn man nur den Arm dreht, ist es nur 3-4 Sekunden an. Finde ich schon unpraktisch, bei all den Infos, die auf dem Display abzulesen sind.Von all diesen pseudo-medizinischen Funktionen habe ich keine Ahnung. Interessiert mich nicht.

Heisst: Sauerstoffsättigung, Schritte, Uhrzeit usw.Apropos: Sauerstoffsättigung wird zuverlässig erfasst und zeigt valide Werte an. Auch die Pulsmessung funktioniert gut. Super ist auch, dass sich der Schlaf überwachen lässt. Mich hat vor allem überrascht wie gut die Uhr erkennt wann man wirklich eingeschlafen und wieder aufgewacht ist. Auch die Anzeige der Schlafphasen ist super.Für die kleine Pause zwischendurch sind sogar einige Spiele installiert. Ich bin allerdings nicht so der Zocker und habe mich damit nicht weiter befasst. Auch eine Wetteranzeige gibt es auf der Uhr, einen Musikplayer und viele Sportmodi. Ausserdem einen Wecker, Stoppuhr, Timer, Atemübungen und und und..Was mir wichtig ist, ist dass die Uhr zuverlässig informiert. Und das tut sie. Sowohl Anrufe, SMS als auch Whatsapp Nachrichten (man kann aber Benachrichtigungen für fast alles einstellen) werden angezeigt. So verpasse ich keinen Anruf mehr. Mein Smartphone ist meist lautlos in meiner Hosentasche. Früher sind mir einige Anrufe durch die Lappen gegangen. Bei einem Anruf klingelt die Uhr und das Handy. Man hat nun die Wahl mit welchem Gerät man ran geht. Das Gute: Geht man am Handy ran, ist das Gespräch am Handy, geht man an der Uhr ran, auf der Uhr. Man kann aber jederzeit zwischen den Geräten hin und her switchen. Das macht es noch viel angenehmer wenn man kurz an der Uhr ran geht, dann aber das Handy aus der Hosentasche nimmt und einfach wechseln kann mitten im Gespräch.Kurzum: Für den Preis ist die Smartwatch einfach Spitze.', '', 'Diseño cómodo y muy bonito.

One of the features I'm a female they don't give you the option to choose a female they need to fix that please The reason why I got this is because it wasn't really big watch it was a 1.39 which was small compared to the 1.9 that the other watches were. Also the screen protectors that I ordered with it they too small they don't cover the whole watch do they make screen protectors to fit the watch The screen protectors are only 1.3 in or millimeters or whatever they are I need one that covers the whole screen. Also like someone had mentioned some of the face options that it gives you to choose from they're not very good some of the other phones had more to choose from I did pick the gold looking one because I liked it better but the other ones are kind of crappy. Also the Bluetooth for the music doesn't let you walk very far at all only a few feet then it cuts out. I hope this does upgrade some options later on since it is a newer model watch that came out just recently That's what I'm hoping but like I said I had to choose male instead of female on my profile. The word female was there but it wasn't in bold where you can choose it if they can fix that please. Also if the alarm can have a snooze option that would be great there is no snooze option. Also on contacts it only lets you choose eight people I was under the assumption it would allow you to have access to all contacts but it does not. So unless you know the number to all of your friends you're going to have to use your cell phone. That's all I can think of for now like I said I've only had to watch since Sunday or actually since Monday. This is June 1st edited I finally did find some more watch facings it took me a while to figure it out but I did find more to choose from I'm hoping they upload more I found an app where you can get more but I can't get it to sync with the watch so somebody can figure that out let me know."", 'This is a ""starter"" smart watch for me to see if I like it and which features I like/need before considering a Pixel or Samsung watch.

For example, the manual has no picture of the watch showing what the buttons are for. What\'s worse, telling you to fully charge the watch before using it the first time would be a lot more useful if there was a diagram or picture showing you how to charge it! It\'s frustrating to say the least.

Restarting the device. Security settings. Bluetooth etc. I cannot get the right earbud to work. I though it might be the contacts. Yet, the operating system on the phone says it is charging.

The operating system it uses I'd say is it's only downfall. Some of the screens don't show up correctly. (the pull down screen is supposed to show battery of headphones and it's all scrambled up when charging) and some other bad screens after playing with it for a while. Which if I didn't know what I was doing with have made it impossible to do something simple like raise the brightness. Overall a pretty good watch though.

There are no apps to install, maybe some watch faces, but whatever apps are in the watch are all that you can use. Also, keep in mind that it tries to save battery by turning off the display if not in use. So this would be similar to using the old Apple watches that didn't have to always-on display and you had to raise your hand or tap it to turn the display on.Very basic and don't make the mistake of comparing this with a $500-$1000 smartwatch or you will sorely be disappointed."", ""This is a beautiful, rugged-looking, military-style smartwatch.  It's not too big and not too tiny.  To control, there are two main buttons on the right side and as well as the touchscreen.  The display turns on when raising up your wrist or pressing either of the two buttons.  The display is colorful and bright; you can easily read everything clearly in the bright sunlight.  You can specify whether the display stays on from 5 seconds to 30 seconds.  There are 5 watch faces to choose from.  One of the best features of this watch is its battery life. I've worn this watch for 4 days, and it still has 50% battery left.  My two other much older name-brand smartwatches only lasted 1 day and required charging every night.  The Bluetooth connection to my phone is strong and does not drop unless out of range.  It's nice to be able to take calls  (or make calls) from the watch without having to go and pick up the phone when it rings.  The sound through the speaker is very clear, and the person I am talking to doesn't know I am talking through the watch.  You can also control and listen to music through the watch.  This is the loudest speaker I have heard from a watch, I have to turn the volume down.  Being a smartwatch, it can track your sleep cycle, steps walked, distance, and calories burned.  It uses the FitCloud app.  It can measure your heart rate and pulse oxygen.  I don't know how it does it, but it also measures your blood pressure.  The watch read one blood pressure reading of 125/82, while my automatic blood pressure monitor read 127/85.  I have a latex allergy, so I'm not able to wear watchbands made of rubber.  This watchband is made of silicone, so no rash or itchiness."", ""This watch is very durable and Affordable.

Inevitably it will show signs of wear, but at this price point you likely won't be overly concerned.All these budget smartwatches have their own idiosyncrasies, and they are constantly evolving. This one uses the FitCloud-Pro app (which BTW only seems to permit/bind one device simultaneously). The app interface is a bit sparse. It has some advantages over similar apps (explains some of it's internal nomenclature with imagery, etc.), but it lacks other customization features as well. There are many, many dial faces to choose from in the gallery.The watch itself only presents limited data (in comparison to other budget models that use the 'Da Fit' app). For example, it won't show future weather forecasts for the rest of the week, and the heart rate, BP, sleep and step data shows no historical information whatsoever. The whole interface on the watch side feels very stripped down. Also, it's a little bit slow on displaying the time when you bring your wrist up (see video) - this is a common issue with budget smart watches.The watch includes an additional band, although the silicone one it is fitted with is extremely comfortable and looks more appropriate to it's rugged case.This is an excellent option for a budget 'rugged' style smart watch.

The step count also fluctuates while the watch is idle on my wrist.On the other hand, the sleep tracking is wayyy off! Didn't track a 3-hour nap I took one evening, and consistently under-tracks my sleep durations at night (2 hours instead of 4 hours one night; 30 minutes instead of 3 hours another night; randomly added 30 minutes of sleep sometime).Another irritating thing I noticed is that the screen does keep hanging at times - when the watch display turns off, or when transitioning between 2 screens, or when using certain features such as the Breath Training, or Camera. In fact, the Camera feature does not work at all!The vibration is barely strong enough to wake you up.The battery is also just fine - not great, but not terrible either. I used the AOD for the first few days, and expectedly the battery drained quicker. It seemed that the battery would last 3-4 days at max with the AOD on, but otherwise should last approx 6 days without it.Overall, while I'd like to say is it okay for a $55-$60 watch, but I have seen other $40-$45 watches on Amazon that would work just as fine as this one, if not better."", 'El reloj no funcionaba, no hacía nada, ni cargaba ni encendia, hice la devolución y tuve que pagar gastos de envío ya que es un producto de un vendedor externo de Amazon, tuve que llevarlo a correos, abonar los gastos del envío, reclamarle a Amazon los gastos de envío que me los devolvieron rapidamente, esperar a que le llegase al vendedor el producto para que me hiciesen la devolución, no vuelvo a comprar nada que sea de un vendedor externo.', 'Würde gern zurück geben..Defekt', 'I wanted a watch that would track my steps,calories and sleep.', ""I thought this watch was firmly aimed at sport and fitness enthusiasts. If you were thinking of telling the time, this isn't for you, since you need both arms -- one to wear the watch, the other to touch it -- pathetically like the very first digital watches from about 1975.The step counter was very effective, but the heart rate monitoring seemed to be slow to respond, not going up when I knew my heart rate must be increasing. There are lots of settings that will apply to different sports and fitness activities. There is a swimming mode, but the instructions warn against getting the watch too wet, so I haven't risked wearing it in the pool.The build quality and appearance are better than one might expect at the price point, so if you haven't ever tried a smart watch, give it a go.""]"

I got a few tiny nicks in the glass because I wear it while doing construction tasks at work so I may add a screen protector.  Main benefit is fashion - it looks like a smart watch without the cost along with reminders to get up and move and drink water.I started researching watches a few months ago and I didn\'t realize Apple watch only works on iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy watch no longer works on iPhone since switching to WearOS.  I\'ve been thinking about moving to iPhone in the fall and want a watch that car run on android or ios.  I  purchased this watch because of the rotating bezel but I didn\'t know until I received it that it doesn\'t do anything.I also wanted a watch that can go more than one day without charging.Key features for me:1. Health reminder to get up and move.2. Time, date, day of week on the same screen.3. Light and comfortable.4. Not interested in sleep tracking and most watches need to be charged so can\'t be worn at night.PROS:- App is easy to use, very clean and provides essential functions like ability to switch from metric to Imperial units - except temp in in C vs F.- Touch Screen works great and uses the same swipe gestures as google\'s WearOS. Visible even in direct sunlight when set to 4/5 brightness level.Touch Screen Protected by the rotating glow-in-the-dark bezel.Navigation is fast with ZERO lag.  Watch faces take about 1 minute to download and install.Battery life is 3 days plus.  Remember, Apple watch and Samsung Gear watches #1 complaint is barely a day of battery life and that is when thewatch is new, as it ages you will struggle to get through a single day.Does what most smart watches do including requiring the app for downloading new watch faces or uploading workout stats.Uses the same magnetic 2 pin charging cable that most watches use and the magnet only sticks when the cable is in the correct position.Lots of watch faces free download - 50+  Turn the button on the side and they change instantly - however the watch can only store 5 faces.compatible with google\'s fitness app if you login to it.- Customization of key features: how long the display stays on, and lift to wake and custom amount of time for each - 5 seconds when you press button to wake and 3 seconds for wake to lift an abilty to turn off lift to wake for better battery life.- Zero freezes and I did not notice the kind of problems that plague many smart watches.- Notifications from phone messages no delay.PROS:- has a microphone and allows taking calls on the watch. Can answer the call and hang up.CONS:- Lacks adaptive brightness - outside you will need the screen to be at full brighness and I would love it if it was brighter and was able to boostbrightness.- Reminders: Drink water, get up from sitting etc.  The watch vibrates and if you don\'t check right away you miss the notification and there is no way to get it back.  It should require being dismissed for a few minutes.  No special vibration for you to distinguish between water / movement reminders and everything else - text messages, calendar, etc.- Notifications: fb messenger chat head / bubbles often fail to display notifications on the watch until you click the chat head on you phone then the messages come through.  Also, all messages are in the same list so you can just scroll through fb or text messages.- Calculator - I can add and multiply but there is no = button and I still have not figured how how to display the results.- Steps is not accurate - same as other most watches because a watch can\'t really whether the movement is walking or just moving your arm.  Be aware that the more ""smart"" a watch is and the more sensors it has the heavier it needs to be and the shorter the battery life.- No ability to redefine watch buttons or custom taps on screen, etc.- AOD - no always on display but even watches that can do that it must be disabled because the watch won\'t last a single day.- OLED vs LCD or LED but they are not as bright when used outdoors and require more power.- Temp in in C vs F, because no setting in software or app to change this. - does not support third party apps the way Wear OS or or apple watch does.- the timer app could be a little better preset timers are okay but the custom timer doesn\'t allow you to switch away from it and it doesn\'t make any sound it only vibrates.- menu on the left of the clock face displays the five most recently used apps.Final thoughts:Light and snappy with a great looking touch screen exceeded my expectations.Integration with phone is reasonable - you might want every notification but that will reduce the battery life of your watch AND phone.', 'Bezel will glow if you forcibly illuminate the bezel with stromg uv light, normal wear will not accomplish this.... Screen resolution is lame and can read certain types of messages like Fb.... Would not load full message from phone... Only fb..... Disappointed', 'Great watch, previously had a Galaxy and this watch does more and battery is amazing. I changed it fully when i got it and has lasted almost a week on one charge. Able to see texts, use it as a phone and listen to music. The watch seems to be working good, but the phone app that the watch attaches to is a little basic. Especially when I know the capabilities of the watch. but thats what i paid for. Solid build quality, battery life and all things that my previous galaxy watch 4 did and more for 1/4 of the money. i will take it. no complaints.', 'Bought it for my nephew. The watch comes magnetic charger. The display looks really good and can be changed through phone. took a while to understand the functionality.', 'When the watch came in I was a bit excited, the design was cool and I liked that I was able to pick different watch faces which became disappointing on how small the collection really is, it automatically connected to my phone by Bluetooth. When I had tried to install the watch faces it would say the battery is to low which wasn’t true it was fully charged and it did this on several of the watch faces I forgot how many. Then I tried out the photon the watch it didn’t work it kept saying Bluetooth has been disconnected, which didn’t make sense it showed that it was connected on the app that you need to get and it was actually connected to my iPhone, but for some strange reason the watch says it’s not connected at all. The price that they charge for the watch itself is overpriced just seemed cheap cheap!!! If you want to take the chance in buying it might make a good present for the kids, but don’t pay the price for it and see if you can haggle lol.', ""The Kavvo Oyster Urban Smart Watch is a feature-packed device designed for users who want a blend of style and functionality in their wearable technology.

It comes with half-decent watch faces, whereas those other models have really crappy built-in and downloadable faces. Still, it could use a few more realistic analog faces and far fewer of those useless ""cartoon"" or ""topical clip art"" background ""watch faces.""  The biggest flaw with this watch is that it only allows a single downloadable watch face at any one time. If you don\'t fancy the built in ones, then you have to constantly swap the single downloadable face in and out (which takes a considerable amount of time) whenever you want a change. Seriously guys, stop wasting the internal memory with really bad factory watch faces (limit it to a few at most) and free up the rest of the memory to hold several custom, downloadable faces. The second biggest flaw is that the app can only manage a single device at any one time, even though it\'s compatible with a lot of these different smart watches.  So, if you have a few different models (e.g. rubber watch band vs. black metal  body/links vs. silver metal body/links, etc.), you have to remove the current device and add the alternative one, every single time you want to switch things up. Not too smart and a real pain.  Aside from that, I\'m mostly pleased with this particular model of the watch (K56Pro).  It has a good range of functionality and, so far, it\'s outlasted and outperformed the two premium Samsung Gear watches that I spent over $400 each for a several years ago. This watch works better, has better battery life, has more features and the build quality seems to be on par with much more expensive models.

I must add that the functionalities of this watch are rich and impressive, and more than just about any of the name brands, though not all work flawlessly. Amazing tech!======I really wanted to like this watch, but in the end had to return it because of bugs and defects. When I selected a watch face within the app, a different face would appear, about 2/3 of the time. At any given time, you'd only be given one time slot  for download. When  I downloaded a face I liked and the watch seemed to have its own mind, giving me a different face. That's what I called bugs. The defect had to do with step counter, which can undercount steps by 2/3.

My only grievance is the sleep app doesn't really pick up on naps and broken sleep. So if you get up for a little bit to take care of something it will not resume recording your sleep.

Esteticamente accattivante e dalle sembianze del mitico G-Shock che avevo 25 anni fa me ne sono innamorato.Ricevuto in un giorno grazie all'impareggiabile servizio di Amazon Prime.

Girando il polso si attiva e si visualizza l'ora senza problemi.La qualità dello schermo Amoled si vede tutta con la qualità e quantità delle app visualizzate. Non adatto alle immersioni visto che arriva a 10 metri di profondità, per me è più che sufficiente consapevole che per lavarsi le mani o fare la doccia non occorre toglierlo.Necessario scaricare l'applicazione indicata dalla quale poter configurare qualsiasi cosa, si collega immediatamente via Bluetooth.Dotato di applicazione per il sonno,impostazioni per allenamento, misuratore ossigeno, pressione e con la possibilità di impostare diversi tipi di allenamento è un partner ideale per lo sportivo che è alla ricerca di un prodotto completo, economico ed evoluto.Dopo circa un mese di utilizzo posso confermare la buona durata della batteria (circa 20  giorni), la comodità del cinturino, la leggerezza dell'orologio nonostante le dimensioni e le funzioni che non finisco mai di scoprire.Non mi sono voluto dilungare troppo sulle caratteristiche perché la maggior parte delle persone (come me) ne utilizza un 10%, ma è sicuramente appagante avere un prodotto tecnologico di questo livello che si interpone tra i modelli economici e quelli di fascia alta.Prodotto che inserisco nella mia lista BestBuy per qualità e prezzo.Mi auguro che la mia recensione Vi sia stata Utile."", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Smartwatch da uomo indispensabile con la vita frenetica di tutti i giorni in cui non riesci mai a seguire una cosa con tranquilla e a stare dietro alle 2000 comunicazioni sia di lavoro che della vita priva, invece grazie agli smartwatch si può , infatti con questo dispositivo puoi ricevere promemoria con vibrazione di messaggi di testo, chiamate e notifiche dei più conosciuti social e applicazioni di messaggistica come Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat, Skype, Line, ecc).ed inoltre ti premette di non perdere mai più informazioni importanti.

For the most part, this is one of the better ones I\'ve had. It\'s shock resistant, which is a very important feature in this type of activity watch. It has to be able to withstand rugged activity. It is resistant to saltwater spray, extreme temperatures, impact resistant and is dust proof, all important features needed for any type of activity similar to military activity. It has all the smart functions, as most smart watches do, for example, stopwatch, timer, pulse, activity tracker, pedometer, weather, music etc.I really like that it can display, blood oxygen, blood pressure and heart rate monitoring. It\'s probably common in today\'s smart watches, but I\'ve never had a watch show the first two of these features. Those are functions that are extremely important to me when I\'m hiking.The activity tracker tracks Running, Cycling, Football, Basketball, Tennis, Baseball, Rugby, Mountaineering and so many other activities. It accurately records your exercise status, steps, calories, and walking distance, and sleep tracker.Not only is this INEYES Smart Watch an activity watch, with a Bluetooth connection, you can make and receive phone calls. It can also receive message from a large number of messaging and social chat sites.  However, it is not capable of sending messages.It has a nice suite of watch face graphics that are very easy to see and are really colorful. It also comes with a spare watch band that, I think, is nicer looking than the band originally attached to the watch.There are a few features that I would have like to have had on this watch. All my military type watches have been ""Waterproof"". This one is not. It has an IP67 water resistant rating. This means it can be used in the rain, washing hands and other like activities. It cannot be used in water! This is one of the most important features that are non-negotiable for this type of watch. It cannot be used for, diving, river crossing, swimming, hot tub activities, taking a shower, taking a bath or anything where the watch is under water.  Many of the cheapest watches have a rating that they can be submerged for a given amount of time and depth.It also would be very nice if it could send messages. It does receive them but they cannot be replied to. In an emergency situation, where talking is not an option, this becomes a big issue.All in all, this watch is nice looking, does a lot of really cool things and will be the one I use in many of my activities.', ""Purtroppo l'orologio non funziona. È arrivato come sempre nei tempi previsti e ben imballato. Ma non si accende.  Sarò costretta a cambiarlo."", ""The watch that I received matches its product description.  I have several inexpensive smart watches (all under $100) and so far I like this one the best.  The App has a lot of do with the functionality of the watch and how well it works with your smart phone.  This App that supports this watch is the FitCloudPro.  While the App is a little bit rough from a user interface standpoint, the features appear to be well implemented.  This watch supports a heart rate, blood pressure, and O2 measurement in addition to the typical fitness tracking features.  This watch is reading my blood pressure to be very close to what I get with a normal pressure cuff.  My other watches are 30/15 or more points lower than my actual readings.  This watch is within 10/5 points of what I get with a cuff and since each cuff reading varies 5 to 10 points, I feel the watch does a really good job.  I wear hearing aids that support bluetooth, so I don't want the watch to direct audio to the watch, and this watch does just a little better job with supporting this, but also still supporting the phone functionality (i.e. I don't have to completely disable the phone connection).  The watch has all the features of my other smart watches that cost almost twice as this watch.  This watch works well for me."", 'Purchased mainly to track progress while walking/joggin but it does so much more... its basically an apple watch..phone/bluetooth/fitness tracker/calender etc...the display has really good quality and touch screen is responsive I was surprise at the amount of features, half of them I havent even got a chance to use..Great to see at night and comes w/ more accessories than your average watch- Full manual on all features-extra springs it broken or needs repair- comes w/ sports type wrist band but has a black metal wrist band included if you want a more stylish look which I thought was a really good additionFor the price this watch is an all in one. Really surprised at the quality..You can also interact it w/ a a cellphone app']"

The charger cable is magnetic and only goes one way on the watch, which is really helpful.  Does a great job at tracking your basic health concerns, like BP and heart rate.

After using the watch for years, I realized the exact aspects I need in a I smart watch and what I don't, so the new Galaxy watch doesn't seem neccessary or a good value to me. Also, I was looking for a more durable build, a watch that I can do the gym, yard work, wash my hands in, use power tools with high vibration, go for days in the woods hiking and camping with a battery that would last... I didn't want to spend big money on a $1000 Garmin with the GPS and all that because I also want to be able to just throw away the watch if it breaks due to my abuse, and buy a new one, so less than $200 was my target. I went with the curved version of the Tank first. I fell in love with the bright, crisp amoled screen and the plethora of free watch faces instantly.  Then the usefulness of all the stuff I had on my Samsung watch was stuffed in here at a much cheaper price point. But the shape didn't feel right to me, it felt like a large fit bit on my wrist and I like a watch.  So I tried the TRex Pro by Amazfit.  It was a little more money but had GPS built in. Down side was the watch was very plastic, very light and cheap feeling and the screen was too dim and not sharp enough for someone spoiled by Samsung. Then I found this watch, which is the Tank T2, and realized it's a Kospet same as the curved screen Tank I had originally bought.  For the price point, I don't need GPS, but instead I get metal, solid feeling build quality, call connectivity with my phone, meets all my workout tracking needs, outdoor needs, battery life is way longer than Samsung, watch face choices are vast, the Kospet app is straight forward and easy to use. I spent $50 less on the Tank T2 than I did on the TRex Pro and in all ways other than the GPS, the Tank2 seems like the better watch...cool. I posted a couple pics to show you can customize the watch face from your gallery, but the camera on my ZFold 4 doesn't do the watch screen any justice, it's just as bright and sharp as my Samsung watch. It's only been a couple days so we'll see how it holds up under daily wear and tare. I installed the screen protector that came with the watch so I'm not worried about scratches to the face, and that metal frame will look tuff when it starts to get nicks and scratches.  This is not my dress-up watch...  At $100, I'm not gonna feel terrible if I destroy it working on a lawnmower or something. I'd recommend if you need a budget friendly watch with call, sms, etc. connectivity to your phone, water resistant microphone and speaker that is loud, (the TRex Pro doesn't have a mic or speaker, by the way, so no talking to your virtual assistant from your wrist and hearing responses) great fitness tracking, not overly blocky like a military style tactical watch but still very masculine and rugged looking, and feels more expensive than it is. I'm pleasantly surprised by the Tank T2 smart watch.***Quick update. I don't know if this is due to poor  build quality or a more common chemical reaction, but after a couple nights out in the woods with bug spray all over me for the mosquitoes, the plastic on the back of the watch looks to be melted...? I've had the watch about 4 days. First outdoor trip with it. I'm guessing the melting is from a chemical reaction to the Deet in the insect repellent spray? Surely it couldn't be from poking the campfire and roasting marshmallows, since this mil spec watch has a higher temp tolerance than my hand... I've included some nee pics of the back of the watch. Any explanations are welcomed...Haven't changed my rating because I still like this watch."", ""I recently purchased the AMAZTIM Smart Watch and have been using it for a few weeks now. Overall, I've found it to be a valuable addition to my daily routine with its impressive range of features and functionality. Here's a breakdown of my experience:**Pros:**1. **Comprehensive Functionality:** This smartwatch truly delivers on its promise of a wide range of functions. It accurately tracks my steps, heart rate, and various other fitness metrics. Whether I'm running, cycling, or simply going about my day, I can rely on the watch to provide detailed insights into my activity levels.2. **Impressive Battery Life:** One of the standout features of this smartwatch is its battery life. It consistently lasts me several days on a single charge, even with active usage. This is a major plus for anyone who doesn't want the hassle of frequent charging.3. **Multi-Language Support:** The inclusion of multi-language support is a thoughtful touch. It caters to a diverse user base and makes the watch accessible and user-friendly for a wider audience.4. **Customizable Watch Faces:** I love having the option to change the watch face to suit my mood or outfit. The watch offers a plethora of watch face options, allowing me to personalize the device and keep things fresh.**Cons:**1. **Size and Weight:** One of the drawbacks I've noticed is the watch's size and weight. It's a bit bulkier and heavier than I anticipated, which can be slightly uncomfortable during extended wear.2. **Limited Color Options:** While the watch is impressive in terms of functionality, the limited color options for the device might disappoint those who prioritize aesthetics and fashion.3. **Data Accuracy:** Although the watch tracks various health metrics, there have been a few instances where I've questioned the accuracy of the data. While it generally provides a reliable overview, some readings can be slightly off.4. **Lack of Apple Fitness Sync:** Unfortunately, for those deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem, this watch falls short as it doesn't sync data to Apple Fitness. This could be a deal-breaker for Apple users looking for seamless integration.In conclusion, the AMAZTIM Smart Watch offers a commendable array of features that cater to fitness enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals alike. Its robust functionality, impressive battery life, and multi-language support make it a strong contender in the smartwatch market. However, the watch's size, limited color options, potential data accuracy issues, and lack of Apple Fitness sync might be factors to consider for some potential buyers. Despite its minor drawbacks, I've found this smartwatch to be a valuable companion for keeping track of my health and daily activities."", ""I don't write a lot of reviews.

Also I can understand why they called it tank! It's very comfortable yet super tough. I love everything about it. I stopped wearing watches years ago but I'm getting tired of whipping out my phone every time I want to do something. I have a decent time x, and a G-Shock. Both cost me more than this and quite literally didn't have a tenth of the functions. Do yourself a favor pick one of these up. Can't beat the price or the quality. If you're on Android it works but it takes a little more set up time. Enjoy"", 'Very impressed with the watch. Major reason for purchasing was for monitoring heart rate, oxygen and blood pressure. Had a Fitbit but the face got to where it was not bright enough to see especially in the sunlight. Love the different watch faces available. My only complaint is that the watch band is too big. I have a small wrist and the outside band comes all the way around to the side of my wrist and catches on my clothes constantly during the day. I wish it came with different size bands to choose from when ordering.', 'I\'m on my second AMAZTIM Smart Watches. The first one stopped working after I went swimming  with it.(Or maybe it was the hot tub that killed it)The second one is lasting longer.The battery life on these is amazing! I only have to charge it up about every 2 weeks, and I only charge it up to 80%.The watch does not seem to communicate with the app all the time. You have to manually sync them every day or so. Maybe that\'s why the battery lasts so long.The app is not really smooth.  There are 70 different sports ""Motion Management"" options that you can track, but they are not in any logical order (such as alphabetical), so you want to limit how many you have installed on your\' watch at any one time or it will take you a long time to find the one you want.The ""Swimming"" mode is not really a lap counter. It\'s just a timer. It also seem to randomly stop counting. Maybe that happens when I rest for a few moments between laps.If you take your watch swimming, be careful not to take it into the hot tub. The instructions specifically say the watch is not meant to be in hot water like a shower. That may be why my first one stopped working.The rectangular watch I am now using is narrower than I expected.The Sleep Tracker screen on the app shows sleep stages, but only shows the sleep start and stop time. It does not show any time increments in between, so if you want to know when you were in deep sleep (for instance) you have to guess at the times.The blood pressure monitor has to be manually activated each time, but the blood 02 sensor works all the time.', 'Great watch for the price. Does everything I need it to do. Tracking, app and msg notifications, phone calling and music control. Very comfortable and not huge on the wrist like some..... Great purchase!', 'I love the look of the watch. I’ve had Fitbits and an Apple Watch, but they were not very durable for my lifestyle and kept breaking. I ride a Harley a lot. I also mountain bike and go wheeling off road often and smart watches don’t like all that shaking, I’ve found. The price for this watch seemed too good to be true and it is. The heart rate monitor is NOT accurate. The blood pressure monitoring is way off. The calorie counting makes no sense and is way off. The sleep tracking seem accurate, though. I like the look and the watch face designs. I love that the crystal hasn’t scratched because I was constantly scratching my Apple Watch and Fitbit. The sensor that illuminate the watch face when I raise my arm stopped working after a SxS trip I recently took. I guess all the bouncing wore it out. I don’t know. I can receive calls but I could never get my text messages to sync with this watch. Very frustrating. I’ll be going back to the Fitbit for now because I hate paying for another Apple Watch. I really just need something to accurately track my heart rate, calories, and sleep. Unfortunately, this watch only did one of those well.', 'I am a smart watch lover, I am always buying a different one and this time I got a big surprise, this one is very pretty, for me round watches are the most beautiful so this one automatically became my favorite of the ones I have, the screen It looks very good, I really liked the contrast of the colors, it is very precise for taking steps, which is what I use the most. I really liked it a lot.', ""So far, the experience with this watch has been good; the setup was straightforward. The battery life has been great, longer than other smartwatches I used. I also try not to have certain features on so I can go for a more extended period without charging. I love the rugged look, and it just looks and feels like a well-made watch and durable. It has been very easy to read the screen, it's a good size, the brightness has been good, and it wasn’t hard to read while the sunlight was hitting it."", 'Within 10% accuracy on bp but always on the low side.Heart rate is ok.Battery life about a week.']"

Touch option is very very sensitive and is difficult to open the apps on the dial. I'm tech savvy but this is very difficult and NOT user friendly at all. Once set up, I'm constantly trying to figure out what the buttons mean on the dial. I'd rather read text than have small logos on the buttons. Not sure if I'll return... Still thinking about it and sticking with FitBit or Samsung Gear."", ""This is probably one of the best watches you can get for the cost right now when compared with the competition, as long as you are willing to put up with a couple issues that I experienced.When the watch first arrives, it comes with the watch itself, 3 different style watch straps, spare strap pins, a USB to magnetic pin-style proprietary charger, and the manual. The manual will give you a QR code to scan to find the app easier, and once installed the app will help you detect the device, pair to it, and set it up. The issue is that the app is mainly for the fitness side of things like tracking your vitals and stuff, but the actual customization aspect is done on the watch itself like setting up your watch faces, choosing your menu layout, and more. The watch also has messages and calling support which is an even bigger pain to setup as just connecting it through the app is not enough to enable that extra functionality. I won't get too detailed as it's difficult to explain, but the feature is there. From monitoring your steps, sleep patterns, workout time, calories burnt, the weather, your health vitals, and even being able to be used as a stopwatch, camera shutter, and more, this is an incredibly useful watch.The issues that I have, is first, all the adjustments are done through the watch directly as I mentioned, so it can be hard to figure out when you first use it, but it gets easier once you know where to look. The second issue is that the app is kind of lacking aside from just the missing settings, so having a better app to interact more with the watch would be nice. Now, my biggest issue with the watch is the charger. The watch comes with a proprietary pin-style charger that magnetically attaches to it, but it can be a nuisance as it doesn't always like to stay attached and can come off easily- which hinders your charging capabilities. The battery on the watch does last for several days at a time for me, but charging it is just a hassle. A couple times I had to attach the charger and brace it gently against something for the charger to stay attached.Aside from those issues, the watch is great and has tons of features for the cost. It's super easy to use once you get used to it, looks great, and the display is very clear. The watch is also very responsive and there is no lag whatsoever when scrolling through the menus or swiping between your different watch tools. I highly recommend this watch to anyone looking for a great way to keep track of time while also staying up to date on their exercise routines and their health vitals."", ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0This watch isn't too bad!

One thing I will say, my husband has an allergy to nickel. He wore this thing constantly for weeks, and this watch unfortunately made him itchy and start to break out. I'm not sure what is in the glass under plate, but something was setting off his skin allergy. Just wanted to let others know who may have the same issue. Also, I doubt the blood pressure app is accurate on here, you would need a machine to accurately tell you your blood pressure.

On top of all that, the battery life is great as well.  My first charge lasted a week before I had to recharge it.  Absolutely no complaints!!"", 'With a crisp screen and easy use of buttons this will become your new watch to rely on. From the limited time we have been using the watch the battery life is great.The charging is done by a magnetic connection on the back of the watch.  Usually keep the watch band flat and then connect the charging cable, providing the best way to connect the magnetic prongs.The hardest part of using the watch was connecting the band.  After that the rest the app and downloading new watch faces is a breeze. Many to choose from and can be downloaded to the app and a simple change takes a few seconds to sync to the watch.There is a heart rate monitor built in and can also be shown on most of the watch dials.

The features they have added over the years are really amazing and this one does not disappoint!The watch and the bands included are very nice.  There is an extra set of strap pins too in case you lose one or two.  The charging plug seems proprietary to me.  It is magnetic, but this watch will not charge on a mag mount.  You need to use the odd two magnet design plug which scares me if I misplace this.  Once fully charged and powered on, this has so many features it was off to the manual I went.  I am all for space and packaging saving design, but could we get a manual that does not require a magnifying glass to read?  Especially for something like this with so many features.  Fortunately, the app is very easy to navigate, (and much easier to read) on your phone and this links easily with intuitive controls.Once the app is connected to the watch, you can customize all the features it offers.  Input your information and the health app is off and running.  This keeps track of your heart rate and blood/oxygen saturation feeding that into the health app on your phone.  All your contacts port over, texts on your wrist, your tunes right there...all very cool!  Still discovering all that is watch offers and will update this if we find any more super cool features you should know about.The price at the time of testing was $69.99 with a $10.00 seller coupon for a $59.99 price tag.  For what this watch delivers, that is an amazing price...highly recommend!"", ""This am affordable way to have a great and durable smartwatch.

It does everything I want and does blood pressure, weather, messages, heart rate, phone calls and cardio. There are dozens of watch face options and a second metal watch band.

It offers almost endless functions, it is comfortable to wear, and the price is right.  It receives texts almost effortlessly, but can\'t seem to deal with calls.  The battery lasts about a week on a charge and the mag safe charger is very handy to use.I really enjoy wearing it and find that I daily check my vital signs, steps, etc.  Unfortunately, I am finding that only the pulse and blood oxygen readings are reliable -- the blood pressure reading seldom comes close to that registered in the doctor\'s office or with a standard blood pressure cuff.  The sleep monitor disagrees dramatically with that of another smart watch I own.  The ""wake"" function is also erratic.I am frustrated because the watch apparently does much more than I have been able to figure out.  It comes with instruction sheets in many languages, but the instructions leave many questions unanswered.  For instance, the Amazon description says you can create a DIY watch face with your own photos, and that the watch provides a weather forecast, but gives you no indication of how to activate either. I\'ve also not been able to activate the watch to initiate and receive phone calls.  Maybe I\'m just a technology ""dummy,"" but I would expect clear instructions for a device as complex as this.  The FitCloudPro app is also not particularly intuitive and I find the orange and white print combination difficult to read.After a couple months of frustration, I am replacing this watch with another, hoping to have better luck.']"

Screen is bright and responsive. I like the app as well. It's easy to understand and settings are easy to navigate. I like the different displays you get as well. The features for this device are plentiful as well.  First off, I love that it is waterproof. I can take it the pool, the shower, as well as those times you get caught in the rain while out on a run. The watch has a sleep tracker, a pedometer and calorie tracker, which helps me stay on top of my fitness goals. The activity tracker is compatible with both Android and iPhone devices, making it a versatile option for anyone.

The design of the watch is pretty simple but for the most part is pretty responsive. It is an okay smart watch with the ability to video call  It does have a few games on the watch. It is nothing extremely fancy, but it will keep them relatively entertained for at least 30 minutes at a time although I am sure the games could get old for them real quick. There is only one camera and that is on the actual front face. It honestly does not take the best quality picture but at least there is an option of video calling.  The outer material is a okay and for the most part is not that easy to scratch up. This is for a kid so it will most likely get scratched up either way. The band fits pretty much any kid that I can tell. There are no band replacements that I know of which is a bit of a downer. It has modes to essentially put it into quiet mode so they cannot use the watch during class. The responsiveness of the watch is pretty good. It is very simple commands. The battery life on this is terrible. You barely get 3 hours out of this so you can only get 3 hours of tracking. It is not exactly safe. If the kids are playing game on it, it may reduce the power even more. You can also set alarms for your kids on the watch. This is a great way to keep your kids productive. The application is simple and works well. Overall this would be a great smart watch if it actually had a better battery. The games are educational and it limits how much screen time parents may want their kids to have. It tracks well and the video calling is okay. The biggest thing is setup is not that hard and works.', ""Aside from the complicated set up, vague, limited, figure it out yourself instructions.  The battery life is AWEFUL.

I've tested this watch for the past 2 weeks, before coming to write the review. I really wanted to give it a fair shake. First, it's important to note that this watch is packed with a lot of features, but getting everything to work did take FAR more time than I expected. The software offers everything  you can imagine, from text and phone, to health, SMS, remote photo, SOS, GPS tracking, and quite a bit more. Since this device does much of which it claims to be, I'm not make this review about tearing it to pieces, but dang...The app isn't buggy, not that I've found, anyway. However, it's as annoying as it gets, with advertisements that just seem non-stop, as well as the News button is just a bunch of Job Listings for tech companies. I wouldn't trust the Amuse tab, either. At first, you'll need to get used to not accidentally clicking on this junk. The next beef I have with this device is the poor instruction booklet. I spent around an hour trying to figure out how to install the SIM card, and finally went back to the Amazon ad. Include that info in the manual! At some point this watch could end up resold and the new owners won't have a clue how to use it, with the documentation you've supplied. SpeedTalk, the cell/data service that is recommended (SIM included) doesn't have a great reputation and there are an awful lot of complaints against the company, where credit card info had been stolen, as well as folks having issues with getting the service canceled (you can't do it virtually, you must call customer service). I tried going with another service, to find that many services are not compatible. So, I did take a chance on SpeedTalk. $5 for a month of limited use isn't very expensive, and my credit card protection is a viable safety net.After getting through the arduous set up, I tested most of the features. Outside of some shortcomings, like a maximum contact list of 15 and the nasty advertisements, there's a fair amount to like about this watch. The GPS location seems to have an accuracy of around 200'. The settings allow for 1 hour, 10 minutes, or 1 minute updates for location. Those settings will likely play into battery life. So, for around a hundred bucks, you have a way of communicating with your kid and tracking their whereabouts. Through phone, text, SOS, etc. There are probably better products out there, but I'm not sure there are many in this price range that have all of the features this watch has.I'm have really mixed feelings about this watch. I do recommend comparing with other products and maybe spending a little more money for a better quality solution."", 'Don’t think this watch is worth the listing price, instructions are confusing. It looks good but the functionality isn’t the best.', ""Surprising and not bad for a child. I picked this up mainly as a cheaper alternative to see how my child works with it. First off, it is buklier than I expected, being about 3/4th of an inch thick. Everything else on it is standard and what you would expect.I'm still in the process of testing this and working with it so I can't offer a huge review yet, but I plan to follow up on this as a quick/short use review isn't worthwhile for this device.""]"

Suicaに対応しているか？A. felicaは実装しているが現段階ではSuica未対応としていますが、felica（Type-F）は実装されておらずType-Aが実装されています。そのためSuica対応は未来永劫ありえないかと思います。（SuicaがType-A/Bに対応すると言うなら別ですが、、、）（1枚目はGen6 Wellness、2枚目はPixel 7 ProのNFCやICを解析したものになります。アプリはDoNFC（Android）です。その他NFC Infoと検索すればいくつが出ると思います。）QAついでに接続アプリに付いて指摘するとGoogle製のアプリではなくFossilのアプリを使用します。ガイドに従えば迷うことはありませんが。（WearOS3からはWear OS By Googleは使わないようです。Pixel Watchですら別アプリです。）', 'Best looking Wear OS smartwatch imo.

I had to dig on the makers site to find an option to purchase larger bands.  Overall it\'s a bit confusing.  Hopefully the flow from one reading to another will go better as I learn.  I expected a bit more, it just doesn\'t look like a serious medical device.The biggest issue for me, with COPD, is the oxygen readings.  My readings run between 88 to 92 on average using quality readers and in doctors offices.  This device ranges from 97% to 99% and that is a good 10% off!  Useless.  I\'ll write again when I get the larger band and spend a bit more time getting to know the device.I got the ""larger band"".  It was accurate.  It was a ""larger band"", however, it was about 1/8th in larger and a good 3/8 at the end has no holes.  So in practice, it\'s shorter.  In the end though, it doesn\'t matter.  I\'ve set up a return on the watch.  The sensor part irritates my skin, maybe because it\'s too tight but it annoys enough to remove the watch.  The screen flashes on in bed at night when I\'m monitoring my sleep pattern.  There needs to be a screen blanking feature.  The sleep study, by the way, works well.  In summary,  The watch seems to be for skinny people that are devoted to exercise.  The health functions are of little value for the rest of us.  The SPo2 function is useless.  In fact it\'s dangerous.  Telling people they have 97% of their normal blood oxygen when they really have 87% is dangerous enough to remove this from the market.  The heart rate was off quite a bit too but not enough to alarm people.  Back it goes.  I\'ll have to rethink how to read my O2 history.', 'The watch works for my needs. The Bluetooth does not stay connected so you will have to recync from time to time and you must have a Amazon prime account. Battery life if you use all features gets you 3-5 days, not 8 as advertised. Affordable. All in all, nice watch for the price.', 'It looks like a Apple on your wrist. The quality in the workmanship is visible. I\'ve had mine for about 2 weeks now. It\'s comfortable, the time and date is accurate and never needs a battery or winding. Rechargeable battery lasts about a week or so and recharges via USB. The software App for the phone was a little disappointing. It seemed to be vague and written to be a ""1 size fits all models"" kind of app. The Bluetooth often disconnects itself intermittently from my phone and needs re-pairing. I could not get the SLEEP monitoring to work. Often at night, with the watch on my wrist literally inches from the phone, it would not track or record my sleep profile, or it would un-pair from bluetooth - disappointing!  I was able to make and accept phone calls on my watch if my phone was nearby; but could not get text messaging to work. The Weather feature does not update regularly during the day - it gives the same temp and conditions, and does not refresh for up to 8 hours. The Music control feature is not really useful. It only controls music played on your cell phone if its nearby. You probably wouldn\'t want to listen to music on the tiny SmartWatch speakers any way. I\'m a big fan of Alexa, so this model, SKG V7 PRO, is worth the modestly higher price to get built-in Alexa. If it did not have Alexa, I may have decided it was not useful enough to keep. Heart rate tracking seemed to work well. Pulse Ox gave a reading, but I don\'t know how accurate it was. Overall, it looks nice and there is a lot of features for the price, but in daily use it doesn\'t shine as brightly and is not as functional as the elaborate advertisements portray.', 'Accurate time and steps. Not sure the stress or heart rate are Accurate.  Too soon to say for sure', 'First smart watch for me, so i thought id try out something not so pricy.So...every feature loads on Alexa as a separate device...WTH...hate that part.The band is huge, so if you have smallish arms you will be taking it to the end.Hit and miss receiving texts.Rarely have phone calls come through even though very close to phone.Basic device, which I was expecting, but hoped the basic functions would work better.', 'Health control settings and notifications for texts and phone calls', 'Has a few problems, but overall, best for the money.']"

Any time you can purchase a new Smart Watch with a 1.43"" Amoled 460x460 screen for 51 bucks, I figure you\'re getting a deal!  I have only been using this watch for a couple of days but so far, every feature I have tested has worked flawlessly.  I\'ve tried the Oxygen sensor, the Heart rate monitor, the Always On Display and the Step Counter just to name a few.  The display colors are brilliant and the text and images are laser sharp!  The fit and finish are not extraordinary but they are far and above what you would expect at this price range.  The 128MB of memory is dismal in this day and age however it doesn\'t seem to have any real negative effect on the watch\'s performance. (At least not to this casual user)  It has a whole slue full of Apps. (Most of the ones you would expect to see on a modern day Smart Watch)  This is a Smart Watch with a spectacular display that looks good on the wrist and by the way, I might also mention that the battery life with its 400mah battery is turning out to be quite exceptional.  So far, after 24 hours it still shows 74% charge remaining.  One last thing I would like to mention:  The free app that connects this watch to your phone (Fit Cloud Pro) comes with what looks like almost 100 free watch faces.  I haven\'t actually counted them but most of then look quite respectable.  One detail that you might want to take note of is its size.  The case is almost 50mm so it probably does favor those with slightly larger wrists.  That said, I\'ve never really thought that large watches on people with small wrists looked out of place. Let me reiterate.  This watch at this price is one heck of a deal and I would highly recommend it.', ""**Update** Soon after I left this review, the sellers of the watch were very kind and offered to refund my purchase (due to my first watch not working after being used in the water, even though it was advertised as waterproof). I received the refund but since I enjoyed the watch so much, I purchased it again. The first watch I had I only owned for 4 months before it broke.  Now, fast forward almost exactly 4 months since I purchased the second watch, IT is now showing defects. There is a large mark on the left hand side of the watch, almost as if there was a bubble of air under the screen protector. However, when I carefully removed the screen protector, to my dismay I noticed that the mark is on the screen itself! It almost looks like the screen is slowly but surely pulling away from the watch.  All I want is for this watch to work as intended, as overall I'm very satisfied with it (when it's not broken in some way). I've included pictures of the mark for reference, both with the screen fully on and with the always on display on. It is very evident the large mark on the left side of the screen. I'm certainly not expecting to be refunded the price of the watch again, although the customer service was so great last time I'm hoping they can do something to help me get a replacement that just works. I am very careful with my tech gadgets so it is not a result of mishandling. I really hope I can get a working replacement somehow soon because when it works, it's a beautiful watch!**At first I loved this watch. It is really nice looking, has an always on display, let's you customize the watchface, allows you to take and make calls from the watch (via Bluetooth), has health notifications, and pushes notifications from your phone to your watch (though your some reason, it shows the same notifications twice every time). HOWEVER, I cannot use ANY of this now because I trusted the (unfortunately) FALSE ADVERTISING. The description states that the watch has an IP68 rating and that it is waterproof (states that you can even take it swimming). So, I trusted the description and took it swimming the other day. There was nothing extreme about the swimming. It was in a regular pool. Well, after I got out of the pool, I noticed there were some white markings around the edges of the glass. I hoped it was just something that would disappear, as my screen still appeared to work properly (for the time being). Fast forward a couple hours, and I went down to look at the time and there was a bright white line straight down the center of my watch face! I was devastated but could still see the time (though who wants a bright white line in the middle of their watch?) Within a few more minutes, my screen had developed a screen door effect with a washed out appearance and then finally a few more minutes later, the screen went completely blank. Thus, I now have a completely useless watch that I used to love. Please beware that while the watch is great in general, (despite the repeated notifications), it is NOT WATERPROOF! I wouldn't have minded nearly as much and would not even be writing this review if I hadn't been misled into thinking it was waterproof. I am very careful with my electronics and would have kept it dry. However, I trusted the description from the manufacturer as accurate and so took it swimming.

Good price, makes a nice gift idea, highly recommend.', 'I like the round interface on this watch. It allows for circular clock face similar to old watches. The watch looks great. The casing is metallic and nicely brushed.  I paired it with my iPhone and it sync right away. The app took some getting used to but wasn’t too bad. The interface is pretty snappy and there’s no lag between menus. Touch screen is responsive. I also like the weight of this phone. It’s not too heavy but also doesn’t feel like cheap plastic. My coworker complimented it when I first started wearing it. Overall a good looking watch.', 'The watch is exactly like the pictures. I buy it for my husband and he love it, but unfortunately don’t work properly with his phone. He can receive calls fine but then he can’t connect any other Bluetooth device, because the watch mute headphones, radio , etc.*I paired with my iPhone and works perfectly. So I’m not sure if this not for Samsung.', 'It works awesome! It has every single feature you need from a smart watch.  It has a phone call reminder, so you do not need to worry about missing an important call. I can also get my text messages on here. It can last about 2 weeks fully charged, which is really amazing!  The strap is nice and functional and I LOVE that it can make bluetooth calls. The screen is  touch screen and the response is fast.  I love my new watch and am very happy with it.']"

While searching for a new one I came across this. The price is what got my attention and as I read on I became more and more convinced this was the one for me.It has a nice, rugged look to it, not like the dainty, fragile look many higher priced ones have. I'm retired military and am impressed with the fact that it passed the military toughness standard, (MIL-STD 810H). Try that with a three hundred dollar named brand watch!At first I was concerned about the thickness. I wear long sleeved shirts while working even during summer and was thinking the sleeve would get hung up. Not a problem here. However, I do have small wrists so some people might have an issue.The watch is easy to use and with the accompanying app, easy to set up and customize. For the past week I've worn this for about fifteen hours a day. I turn it off when I get home for the day and turn it on the next morning. It still has about eighty percent battery power.It has many activity trackers, but being sixty eight years old I won't be using many, if any of those. I do like and use the health trackers though. I know those are not that accurate but they give a good ball park reading. I have only one issue with this watch....I use a bluetooth while at work so I can make and answer calls hands free without disturbing those around me and continue working. If I make a call using the watch phone feature the other party's voice comes through the watch not through the bluetooth. I had to disable the watch phone feature, which I really wanted to use. But, that's ok, I can live with it.If you want a decent smart watch built for the every day, blue collor worker, this is the one for you."", ""Purchased on 2-27-2023 went on vacation 5-28-2023.

It was advertised as waterproof, I unfortunately did not purchase a warranty.  It was passed Amazon's return or replacement window so I will not buy this produce again.

I've had other watches in the past that go berzerk when they get into salt water, but fine otherwise.  I knew nothing about this one, and made a quick buy based on price and good reviews.  For $75, its a great deal.  It also held up very well during 2 weeks of very active use, swimming, snorkling, diving, and not one issue.  I do not wear a watch at night so cannot speak to the sleep tracking.  I did use the other functions for steps, BP, heart rate, reading text messages, and screening phone calls.  It does have a decent speaker to talk into for phone calls, but I haven't used that feature yet.  Overall a good value so far."", 'Es de batería durarera y muy resistente', ""this is a good watch, I liked the blood pressure monitor, and sleep monitor.  If you mostly want a fitness watch, this one may be a good choice esp if you want military grade, but it is a bit bulky.  Most smartwatches all seem to use the same DaFit software, so they will all likely have the same limitations.  My experience was this watch's sensors were fairly close to being on spot for spO2, bpm, bp, steps count. Unfortunately the spO2 blood oxygen monitor is only when you press the button.  It doesn't measure your spO2 continuously during sleep time which is what I need, and this was a deal breaker for me.Then again, for the price, you can't expect too much.I went with the versa 4 over this, which provides continuous spO2 monitor during sleeping hours and provides more accurate  sleep data.  It provides a graph showing how spO2 fluctuates  during sleep time which the AMAZTIM doesn't do.  Versa 4 can only receive calls, not make any calls.versa also lacks blood pressure monitor.  It also reminds me to move if I'm idle for an hour or more.The iWatch has it all, but cost 400-800 depending on model.Neck to neck between versa 4 and iWatch 8, the iWatch wins, it has alot of extra functions like ability to watch youtube which you may or may never need.  However the iWatch will cost alot more, and you need to already own iphone.  I have not tested the iWatch for sleep data and spO2."", ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0(SEE UPDATE AT THE END)This was a Christmas gift from my wife just this past December.  WAS my favorite watch... until after only 7 months.  It stopped receiving text messages and the screen would periodically show nothing but gray specs - like an old TV without reception. I used to be able to reset it and it be okay, but now it won't even reset. It's stuck blinking and buzzing (see video). I didn't even swim in it or drop it or anything like that. It just stopped working. It's now past the return or support period, so I'm now stuck with a dead watch... and wifey won't buy me another one till Christmas.UPDATE:Since the review posted, they sent a replacement at no charge. After getting it configured, I noticed that it's an updated operating system which I like better. So far, it seems to work really great. I definitely am pleased with the watch and the customer service. I recommend this watch. Changed the review from 1 to 5 stars."", ""This watch has everything I personally need. Time, Date, & Steps. The only problem I've had so far is when I try to turn the GPS mode on it gets confusing. I wanted to track myself mowing my lawn, but I couldn't figure that part out.

Notifiche, sveglia, Torcia, Calcolatrice, Misurazione del Sonno, del battito cardiaco, della pressione, dell' SpO2. Anche i giochi! (Si 🤣)Partiamo dalle basi:App DaFit che gia conoscevo e quindi mi ha fatto ben sperare. (Torno dopo coi contro)Batteria buona fà 4 giorni pieni con notifiche e chiamate, senza però rilevazione continua di HR ed SpO2.Display nitido, colori brillanti, ottima la risposta al touch. Comodo il pulsante a rotella per poter navigare tra i vari menù (peccato non permetta di navigare al 100% senza toccare lo schermo).Rilevazione sonno, HR ed SpO2 abbastanza buone, non rileva alcuni risvegli fino ai 5 minuti, ma nel complesso svolge bene il suo lavoro. La pressione sanguigna invece non risulta molto precisa, pur tenendo il cinturino ben stretto sballa di anche 20unita in più ma comunque è un extra ed anche sulle istruzioni consigliano di non prendere troppo sul serio.Notifiche ottime, ricevute in tempo reale senza il minimo ritardo rispetto al telefono, si riescono a leggere fino a 3 pagine (dello smartwatch) ma niente emoji.Veniamo ora ad alcune pecche:Rubrica estremamente piccola: solo 8 numeri sincronizzabili e non sempre gli altri che si ha in rubrica vengono visualizzati col nome al ricevimento di una chiamata. Il microfono pecca un po' di qualità, mandando un suono un po' confuso e con troppi rumori di fondo. La cassa invece si difende benissimo, audio forte e nitido.Scarsissima la sincronizzazione con la app: dalla rilevazione di HR e SpO2 che non venivano registratate nello storico alla gigantesca perdita di passi (ricordiamoci che è uno dei motivi principali per aveli al polso!) Dove nella stessa giornata e stesso periodo di tempo, con un'altro smartwatch allo stesso polso, questo segnava 1700passi l'altro superava i 7200.Ultima nota, purtroppo mi era arrivato con delle righe sullo schermo nella parte inferiore destra: le avrei pure ignorate se avessi trovato delle pellicole protettive per porne evitare delle altre e se avesse funzionato correttamente. Peccato!In sostanza: buono smartwatch, grandi le potenzialità e gli utilizzi, buona l'interfaccia e ottima comodità al polso dove risulta leggero, nonostante si senta il peso rispetto ad altri concorrenti della stessa fascia prezzo.Aggiungo un chicca: dispone di una funzione per permettere all'acqua entrata delle fessure di uscire, da attivare con apposito pulsante quando si tira giù il menù a tendina dalla schermata principale! Lo smartwatch dovrebbe essere IP67 quindi non ho valutato le prestazioni con nuoto od altro, ma solo lavandomi le mani in acqua fredda.Reso a malincuore per i difetti appena elencati, ma forse ho solo trovato io uno difettato!"", ""Recensione dello smartwatch AMZSA:Ho avuto l'opportunità di provare lo smartwatch AMZSA e voglio condividere la mia esperienza con questo dispositivo. Iniziamo con il design: l'AMZSA ha un aspetto semplice e minimalista. La cassa è realizzata in materiale plastico leggero, il che lo rende confortevole da indossare per lunghe periodi di tempo. Il cinturino è regolabile e abbastanza resistente.Dal punto di vista delle funzionalità, lo smartwatch AMZSA offre alcune opzioni di base. Puoi ricevere notifiche sullo schermo, come messaggi di testo e chiamate in arrivo, ma la visualizzazione di queste notifiche potrebbe risultare limitata. Il display non è particolarmente nitido e i testi potrebbero essere difficili da leggere.Una delle principali caratteristiche dello smartwatch AMZSA è il monitoraggio dell'attività fisica. Puoi tracciare i passi, la distanza percorsa e le calorie bruciate. Tuttavia, i dati forniti potrebbero non essere completamente accurati, quindi se sei un utente attento alle statistiche precise, potresti voler considerare alternative più affidabili.In termini di durata della batteria, lo smartwatch AMZSA ha una durata media. A seconda dell'uso, la batteria può durare da uno a tre giorni. Tuttavia, la durata della batteria potrebbe essere influenzata negativamente se si utilizzano attivamente funzioni come il monitoraggio dell'attività fisica o l'utilizzo di notifiche.In conclusione, lo smartwatch AMZSA è un'opzione economica per coloro che cercano un dispositivo di base per monitorare l'attività fisica e ricevere notifiche. Tuttavia, se stai cercando funzionalità più avanzate, una migliore qualità dello schermo e una maggiore precisione nei dati, potresti voler considerare altre opzioni sul mercato."", 'Had this watch as a Christmas gift now it’s completely stopped charging hopefully I can contact seller and they can helpBecause it is a great watch with many different functions', 'Grandissimo', 'Ottimo', ""BlackSo far, it's working okay for me..One thing I noticed so far is that the battery icon doesn't display.

I left it on all the time because it was monitoring my body, even during sleep. I originally purchased it for the sleeping functionality.I’m an insufferable insomniac, and I wanted to see how much real sleep I was getting at night.

Nothing. The watch was dead. I couldn’t try different charging cables since this one is proprietary and unique to this watch. Since it wouldn’t charge (and yes, I did use other USB wall plugs), the watch is now useless.I’m trying to decide if I should return it for a replacement or just get my money back. Of course, I don't expect the manufacturer to respond to my review with warm and fuzzy feelings.I purchased this watch on December 15, 2022. It was delivered on December 18, 2022, and I don’t believe I put it on right away. I think it was approximately a week before I downloaded the software, charged the watch, and put it on my wrist. I am my mother's caretaker, and she is very close to the end. So, taking care of her was a priority, and I did not get around to sitting down and writing this review until today, January 23, 2023. I have until January 31, 2023. I’d like to return it or get a replacement.I am kicking myself because I should’ve known better. You know how it goes: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.The reason I’m kicking myself is because when I buy on Amazon and most other sites, I always take into account the percentage of four- and five-star reviews. If you add up the percentages of those two and you get below 80, I always stay away from it. Well, I should’ve known because I did that math before I purchased the watch. I love the reviews; 50% gave the watch five stars, and 16% gave it four stars. I don’t rely on the other three. If the four- and five-star rating percentages combined are over 80, I feel good about my purchase. Doing the same math on this product gives me 66. That means that close to half of the people who purchased it thought it was junk.I should have listened to my logic and reason. Now, after writing that last paragraph, my decision is made. I am sending it back for a refund. Why would I want a replacement?"", 'I was really scared to buy this watch after reading many reviews but i must say i am pleasantly pleased,  i love being able to upload my own picture to the watch and the battery is seeming to last multiple days...', 'Battery life is not super great i was wishful for about 4 day got maybe 2....', 'I bought this watch for my husband, he really loves it very much. I actually bought it for sleep tracking, but there are so many features on it, I recommend this watch to everybody. AND it looks great, my hubby got a lot of compliments already.', 'This watch is very comfortable to wear, not big and bulky, does everything I wanted', 'I found the perfect combination of a super smart/sporty watch and at a reasonable price. I love this watch. It does everything a smartwatch is expected to do. Very satisfied here. I recommend it.', ""It's nothing to like it"", 'This watch I got for my young teen who wanted a smart watch. For his purposes this works well. For me, I would need a longer battery life and more accurate functions.', 'PROS:- Battery life is excellent- Light and comfortable- Watch band is durable and comfortable.- Very good software- Customizable watch faces and many to choose from- A lot of functionalityCONS:- Blood pressure readings are wildly inaccurateI really like this smart watch and will continue to use it as my daily timepiece, but a potential buyer needs to know that these devices should not be used as a health monitor. As a fitness tracker, it works very well in most respects. And as with most smart watches, the software it pairs with on your mobile device makes a huge difference in the overall experience you will have.Thankfully, the ""DaFit"" software is really quite nice and very functional. The software allows you to change watch faces and control various settings of the watch. It makes this device punch above its price point and is one of the reasons I really enjoy using this watch.The pulse readings seem to be consistent with my exercise bicycle. I cannot speak on the accuracy of blood oxygen, as I have nothing to compare that to, but there is a serious issue that needs to be addressed with the blood pressure readings.The blood pressure readings from this device are very, very inaccurate. I have high blood pressure and was very interested to see how that feature would perform on this device. I can very confidently say that this device consistently gives readings that are in the normal range, when in reality my blood pressure was quite a bit higher. I also have an at-home blood pressure testing device that is calibrated and gives accurate readings, even when compared to the doctor\'s office when I go there.So, as long as you are not depending on the blood pressure readings, I can still recommend this watch for its wealth of features and price.', 'This is a very nice smartwatch.  The metal band is elegant.  There are not many smartwatches that you can wear with dress clothes.  This is one that you could wear to the gym or to church, and it wouldn’t look out of place.  No silicone band and cheap looking plastic bezel here.This is a generic smartwatch.  Basically unbranded.  Undoubtedly made in China, but don’t fool yourself - the name brand watches come from China as well.  The problem with the lack of a name brand means that there is probably not a lot of tech support.  This is not a huge problem for me, since I look more for features than product support and a large community of users.What attracted me to this particular watch is its impressive set of features and low price point.  Look, it has a GPS, pedometer, heart rate monitor, and sleep monitor.  All of these are pretty standard, even in the bargain basement smartwatches.  However, this one also has an O2 sensor and blood pressure monitor.  These are usually only available on the higher end, high-priced watches.  Also, they are fairly accurate as far as I can tell.  I have a fingertip pulse oximeter and a home wrist blood pressure monitor, and the watch gave me numbers that were pretty comparable.  Bear in mind that you are not going to get the same accuracy as medical equipment, but it should get you in the ballpark.  It is getting its data from reading your wrist.  I found it acceptably reliable.Sleep tracking is hit and miss.  To me it would work a lot better if you could tell the watch when you sleep and when you wake up.  As it is, it tries to figure it out from reading your heart rate and detecting your lack of motion.  I work swing shift, and often when I sleep during the day, it doesn’t think I’ve slept.  Other times, it will detect me sitting in the recliner for a few hours in the evening as sleep.Exercise and workout tracking are also a little dicey.  There are 8 sports modes, but none of them cover what I do.  I do home workouts - yoga, bodyweight exercises, kettlebells, and rowing machine, but none of the sport modes work for what I do.  I set it to “Walking” or “Jumping”, and half the time it tells me I haven’t moved enough, so it doesn’t save my data.  Again, if I could just tell it WHEN I exercise and have it record the duration of my workout and give me a graph of my heart rate, I’d be happy.  Alas, eight sport modes don’t help me.The watch pairs with my phone easily, and there are all the usual features as far as phone controls.  You can get notifications, texts, and even use the watch for music controls.  I don’t use any of that too much.So, this is a very nice watch at a very decent price with a lot of high end features.  The build quality and hardware are comparable to much more expensive watches.  The downside is the app and the software.  When you buy a name brand watch, you buy into their ecosystem and get a much better app with a larger user community, more frequent updates, and tech support.  This watch has the “DaFit” app which, to be honest, is underwhelming.  I’ve had a couple of other smartwatches including a Pebble and Amazfit, and the apps and community support are much better with the name brands.  There are a limited number of watch faces available on the app, and the app has a limited number of options.  Not a large user community either, so you won’t find a lot of resources on the web.  On the plus side, it will integrate with Apple Fitness and Google Fit, so you can use the tracking data.Battery life is pretty good for all of the features on the device.  I get about a week between charges.  Better than the Galaxy watch or Apple Watch that needs to be charged every day.As I said, very nice looking, feature-filled watch for the money.  Five stars for the looks, but I’m taking a star away for the (pretty awful app and lack of community support.']"

It appears they ran it over in soft dirt and the watch survives. I decided to run it over with a semi tractor they can weigh 50tons. The watch definitely didn’t survive as soon as the tire was starting to crawl up the watch the screen exploded. I wanted to take the durability to another level. Other then it failing this test, it truely is a excellent watch. I’ve had it run and drag against metal trailer walls, boxes, and other walls without the screen breaking, chipping, or scratching. I can see the screen in direct sunlight really well. I do enjoy that I can read text messages as they arrive from the watch screen. It does a really good job reading my heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen levels. I also like the 70 different sport options it even includes skating which is definitely a feature I wanted. Also includes archery, judo, hiit, horseback riding and fishing are very surprising. Yoga, strength training, and others. It also holds a charge for long periods of time and I have peace of mind not worrying about the battery dying fast. I’ve had the watch survive 2weeks on a single charge.If you were to run it over with your car or truck that weighs less then 24tons it will still most likely shatter like mine did. I think the key to it surviving getting run over is it must be on very soft sand, pillows, etc soft things to survive. I’ll give it 4 stars cause it’s a excellent watch for the price.', ""I've tried a lot of inexpensive smart watches and ended up being a big fan of the Amazfit line. I like to have long battery life, always on display and noticable notifications. Nothing has ever come close to giving me everything as well as my original people did, although the Amazfit BIP came close.This Kospet has been great so far. Real life battery life with always on display in just under three days, and with it off I've been getting 6 days with light use. That 60 day claim must be if you leave it disconnected from your phone and never use it, lol.That being said, it's a really premium feeling solid watch. Normally not having an always on display that lasts more than three days would be a no starter for me, but the Kospet is incredibly responsive with lift to wake.The best part in my opinion is that I can actually read the notifications. The screen is great.At least than 100$ it's a great deal. Highly recommended."", 'Been using this smartwatch for like 2 weeks now even though this is a great watch with all its functions it does have some issues that I have noticed.  Great quality and durability, and touch sensibility are good, answering and talking with the smartwatch works great.  A few things that I have had some issues with keeping the watch connected to my phone and the app.  The Bluetooth connection is very limited in distance, if you are more than 5 feet away from your phone it will not keep a Bluetooth connection.  On occasion, you will lose connection to the app and you have to restart your phone to connect correctly.  So I do not receive a lot of my email or text notifications due to stepping way more than 5 feet away from my phone and then you lose the Bluetooth connection temporarily.  If Kospet can update or fix these little issues then that would be the best-value smartwatch period!  But overall Tank T2 is still a pretty great smartwatch for the price and features.', 'Llevo 2-3 días utilizándolo y hasta ahora he quedado satisfecho en su apariencia y funciones.

If you wear it on your left wrist, place your hand flat on the right side of your chest while sitting upright, make sure the watch is not loose, and breathe... Then take it over time and check it with another accurate one. You will either get consistent, accurate readings, or they will be off by the same amount each time; you can adjust that. If it is the same and wrong, try a different position. It isn't a $1,000 Garmin or other watch. There is one where the Blood Pressure Monitor is AMA(Government also) certified accurate. The many exercises listed have mostly the same thing, a calorie counter. It has a great feature that allows you to see the time in either digital or traditional format all the time. Battery life is shorter, but it still lasts days if you don't do too much-calling stuff. It has a lot of faces available, but I am having a hard time finding add-on faces in the play store. The different faces are also not exactly touch screens, more like changing screens to do things. Everything can be done easily on a phone, the setup, etc. I recommend it for a started digital smartwatch. You can see if you like the differences without dropping $500-$1,000. I recommend it."", ""I like the watch.  I charged it up to 100% when I got it and 8 days later it was still showing 40% charged.  That's a far cry from my Samsung watch that needed to be charged almost every night.  I do not use the watch for monitoring my sleep, I sleep fine, so I do not wear it at night.  I am sure that helps with the battery.The associated phone software needs a little work.  It will occasionally lose contact with the watch.  Eventually, the two will sync back up you just need to wait a bit.  One thing my Samsung watch did, was stay reliably stay connected to the phone but the battery life on this watch and it's other features far outweighs any negatives with the software.UPDATE:While I am still experiencing minor connection issues, the watch itself is a 5 star. I have to say I have seldom had better customer support to address the problems I experienced.  The company has reached out to me on more than one occasion in an effort to correct any dissatisfaction I had. I am seeing an improvement in the software since the last update. It is a pleasure to work with people that really care about their customers and the products they sell."", 'At first I was a bit disappointed by certain factors but mon the customers service is so excellent 👌 they did everything possible 😀 in there hand to make sure I am satisfied I am great at there effort thank you very much', ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0The Kospet Smart Watch design is sleek and stylish, making it perfect for dressing up or down.

Unlike other watches, you don't have to constantly lift your wrist or touch the screen to check the time, the display never sleeps. I can't stand watches that always go to sleep or require screen touches just to see the time. Sure, it may save battery life, but when it comes to convenience, I value battery life and easy time viewing.The built-in fitness tracking features are amazing, You can use it for health and fitness goals without having to use a separate device.  It's like having a personal trainer on your wrist. You can track your health and fitness goals without the need for an additional device.

La batería dirá más que otras marcas de mejor prestigio.Exelente relación costo calidad !!Vendedor Exelente', 'I purchased this watch as a lightening deal, shipping from & sold by Amazon.I checked out the reviews and came to the conclusion that most all of the negative feedback was user-error not product failure. (I seriously looked into multiple Amazfit, Garmin, Fitbit etc)Upon my receipt of this watch, I placed it on a charger then watched a few videos on how this watch works & read the manual.  Once charged... it took a bit of tinkering to get all of the necessary permissions set.  If your permissions are right, this watch does everything it claims. If one thing is slightly off... your watch will not function to its fullest ability.  If you aren\'t techy... you may wish to enlist the help of a young person.  They breeze through electronics. Don\'t be afraid to play with your watch. Test the features. Make sure you set it up to fit your needs and you will love it.I love that this watch is large, waterproof, military drop tested.  I frequently fall and needed something that could handle a beating & still work.  More than activity tracking, I needed something that I could use to get emergency help. On my person 24/7 or as close as possible to that. The only time I don\'t have it on is when it needs a charge.  It only takes an hour or two then goes right back on my wrist. Your phone HAS to stay in range with your watch or the Bluetooth connection will have to be reset. (It\'s a pain but it\'s not the watches fault) I\'ve had my BT drop from going outside of range.  It was frustrating until I mastered how to reset it. For reference, I\'m using a Samsung Galaxy a53 5g.  I still keep my phone on my person in a small phone crossbody bag at all practical times. When in the shower, My phone can be on the counter in the bathroom incase I fall in the shower & need emergency help. I can press a button, call or use the voice commands to call if I can\'t use my hands. This is much better for me & cheaper than ""Life Alert"".I have no issues placing or answering calls on my watch. (The watch speaker does get some feedback squeak) I love being able to get notifications of my texts. If it\'s a long text you will not be able to see it all until you check your phone.  You can set up ""quick responses"" so you can answer back from your watch but I don\'t use that feature.  You could also text with your voice via the watch.  I prefer to pick up my phone & answer texts that way.  You can completely customize how you use this.  You can set this up for all notifications or you can pick & choose which ones you want.As for the health monitoring.... it\'s a total bonus for me. Accurate too. The app, ""Kospet Fit"" is FREE. Included with your watch and there is no monthly or additional monitoring fee.Amazfit & Fitbit both cost monthly for the app!  That made my decision easier.  I\'ve had my blood pressure checked professionally and compared with the watch results.... very accurate. The sleep tracker is phenomenal!  This can track your quality and duration of sleep. It breaks down how long you were awake, light or deep sleep, REM etc.  It makes recommendations for improving your sleep too. I like the blood oxygen sensor. I set mine to test every 60 minutes. I had no idea that my oxygen levels were dropping down to 92% overnight.  Not every night but enough to indicate an emerging sleep apnea issue. 1-4× weekly. You can look at your charted results which make it easy to spot anomalies. It gives you more control over your health. Giving you immediate access to your own stats and you can share it with your physician. It helps to enhance the quality of your healthcare.I guess Amazon repackaged this in a generic-ish box.  The presentation was OK.  I later found out that because I didn\'t buy this directly from Kospet they do not honor the warranty.  They refer you back to the seller you purchased it from (Amazon etc).I needed 2 defective items replaced. The watch band & screen protector (it didn\'t seat properly due to defect). This is a current issue. I will provide updates.I did purchase an Assurion product protection plan.  So far it has really Is a pain getting warranty help.  Apparently I have to deal with Assurion. Fill out claim forms etc.  Yuck! I don\'t ordinarily buy protection but it was worth it to me to make sure that this watch will at least last 3 years.If you wish to get other watchbands look for the 22mm watchbands. I have gotten several. Soft Nylon, ventilated rubber, leather & tactical type.  I like styling options.I know this is being sold as a man\'s watch but I\'m an average sized feminine woman and it fits perfectly.  I like bigger when it comes to Smartwatch screens. Don\'t overlook this as an option ladies.I am very pleased with my purchase overall.  I highly recommend this Smartwatch . It really does do everything it claims!', ""This smartwatch is rugged, it's just not for namesake. I have been wearing it doing all kinds of activities. I accidentally have knocked it on walls, scratched it against pavement and I thought it would have some marks from it... Somehow, nothing. Still looks like new.The software on it runs smoothly. The connection to the phone never drops. It was easy to set up initially as well.On to the watch features, the sports activity tracking is phenomenal. I haven't really tried the automatic recognition of sport activity, because it is really simple to start tracking an activity at the push of a button. It has a toolbox app with everything you would expect a smartwatch to have, you can quickly set a timer, start a stopwatch with laps, alarm (though the alarm leaves a little bit to be desired), find phone (which I didn't know I needed this bad), and a flashlight that works by turning the screen white (I thought this wouldn't be that useful, but it actually helps a lot to use your keys in your car or door if it's dark or similar tasks). It is really great in my experience to track sleep. The time when I go to sleep and wake up are very accurate always. I have used it for about 3 weeks and every day I can see how well was my sleep session. Not once has the time it starts or ended been off. Can't really tell if deep or light sleep or REM are accurate since that's hard to measure any other way, but sometimes I feel a bit tired and notice I didn't sleep deep or in REM much. I also moved recently and my sleep is better so I suspect the watch tracks sleep quality as intended.One test I have done with the watch is counting number of steps and seeing how many steps the watch records. It is accurate to the tee. I counted 40 steps, the watch measure 42, I counted 70 steps and the watch had 73 recorded. I also counted 200 steps (yeah, I'm boring that way) the app recorded 207. You can even do this step and watch your step count in real time. It does take a bit to get started and a delay to stop but it records steps in between very accurately.Another test I did was comparing it to the heart rate monitor at my gym. The heartbeat was the same as the one displayed in the treadmill at my gym, so I know that the heart rate was accurately measured.I love the companion app, where you have a dashboard where you can see your data and select different views for it. You can also change settings in your watch easily without have to use charge from the watch.The battery life is exceptional. In the three weeks I've had the watch I have only charged it twice and it's currently at 40% as I'm almost on my second week. One of those charges was partial and the other one I charged to 100%. One nice feature that I wish it had was an alarm for when the watch is fully charged (note it doesn't have this). It would be nice if my phone rang when the battery is charged fully. It charges surprisingly quickly. I think it takes less than an hour to fully charge from battery depleted to full battery, but I still haven't tested this as I have no way of knowing when the battery is full.The watch is really comfortable in my wrist and the two clips that hold the belt are a nice feature. It also doesn't feel uncomfortable under long sleeves, jacket or coat. I also don't take it off for showers and hasn't shown any issues regarding taking a shower or immersion under water. I also sleep with it and it is not bothersome.Great watch! If you want to teach your heart rate, sleep quality, blood O2 level, steps then this is your watch."", ""The replacement watch works better now. I'm very satisfied with the service."", 'It has some good and bad sides. Battery life is not what they claim. Lasting for almost a day and a bit more. Charging speed is average. Heart rate monitoring is almost accurate. Oxygen also. Steps are sometimes confused if you are swinging your arms....Blood pressure measuring is a joke! They should take it out.Sleep monitoring is good enough. Not very accurate but close enough.I like the shape, the time feature and the basic health monitoring sensors.Good to be a starting Smart Watch...', 'Pros:1) A lot of features available to use for.2) User friendly, simply to connect/set up.

There is that option in the app, yet not on hardware?!2) When using stop watch, it cannot work in the background. Stopwatch performing occupies entire screen and does not go away before quit doing it (??). It is impossible to use the smartwatch for any other purpose while stop watch is on. Hard to believe that  manufacturer did not sort out this basic programming option. Hoping they\'ll fix it for very next app updates.It\'s worth the money paid for.4 stars. These 2 deficiencies could be easily fixed by programming in the very next app software update. Hoping the manufacturer will read this (??).', ""This is only my second smartwatch, so saying it's the best I own might not mean a great deal. But I immediately became very comfortable with using it. Setup was easy, and the app works well. CAUTION: many inexpensive smartwatches out of China have flaky, incomplete software, and things like watch faces require extra cost. There's a good selection for this watch, and all are free. The watch alleges it can measure blood pressure, heartbeat, and count your steps. I'm unsure of the accuracy of any of these, but the numbers seem to be ballpark correct. There are oodles of sports modes, and its automatic sport-detection works fine: I was walking briskly ant asked if I wanted to record my exertions. I like the sleep tracker, even though the app tells me off for not being in bed early enough. I've washed it once, with soap and water, and it didn't mind at all - it still works fine. A really nice touch is that you get a screen protector with it. The instructions are easy to follow and sufficient in quantity. The only slight blot is that charging is  bit slow. But then, my first charge lasted me just on 3 weeks, which quite amazed me. The screen is bright, has great colours, and is easy to see in sunlight. Compared to $500+ for a similarly featured Mobvoi (which may receive very limited updates during its very limited life), it's a bargain; so too, compared to the poorly-finished, non-waterproof watches on AliExpress (for about half the price), the value-for-money this Kospet gives is still even more compelling. If I somehow managed to damage it beyond use, would I buy another? Without hesitation."", ""I'm very satisfied with the KOSPET TANK M2, which is a very robust military-grade smart watch.Its metal shell looks exquisitely crafted and durable. The smartwatch's HD display provides ultra-clear visibility in sunlight. This watch is simply amazing. I can choose from a variety of watch faces on the APP but prefer a picture of myself as the watch face. It can accurately measure my oxygen and blood pressure, and heart rate, and even track my sleep during the day. It has 70 motion modes, and when I walk for more than three minutes, it automatically prompts me to start walking mode, which is pretty amazing. When I've used my watch for the phone, the speakers sound crisp and loud.

The only thing I dislike about it , is that sometimes it needs to be re-synced to the phone every so often and the app is constantly running. The battery life is absolutely amazing and can go almost 2 weeks on a single charge. I went on a 20 mile , 3 day backpack trip and it tracked my calories burned ,  overall miles , and heart rate. This is a great watch for the price. The most important thing to me about this watch is that it can take a huge beating. I work in a Shipyard as a mechanic so I'm constantly having to crawl into tight spots , bash my body against all sorts of hard and dirty objects , and also welding or running a torch of some kind to cut huge chunk of metal. At first , I'd cringe whenever I'd smack the watch against something or it get snagged on whatever just because I didn't know the full quality and life expectancy of this watch. After a few weeks I stopped caring because I knew this was a solid buy and it's a very rugged watch. This watch has been great and when eventually it dies out , I'm going to go with the Tank M2 model just because that one supports calling from the watch itself. This M1 model only gives you incoming messages and shows you who.is calling you but you can't make outgoing calls from this watch. All and all , a great watch though."", ""Update, I want to express that the customer service for this company is outstanding, after emailing with them them about my issues they resolved this very quickly and we're prompt to reply to all emails within 24 hours, I will say that is impressive and shows dedication to wanting to provide great customer service for their product!The watch itself seems to be nice, if you want it for step counting then it might not be for you. I walked 2 miles and it registered 3254 steps which is not correct, add about 800 steps to whatever you get daily, I'm sure in time this will be addressed with software updates.The heart rate and BP monitor seem to be fairly accurate which surprised me considering the step counter wasn't quite right. I'll give it more time to get broke in since I have only had it a few days and I will try and remember to come back and update.Update, battery is at 41% after 3.5 days definitely not what I have seen with reviews, allot of people saying that this battery lasts 2 weeks, 30 days etc. I have a hard time believing that this battery will ever last more than a week that's if you do not connect it to your phone. I have unpaired the phone to see how much longer the 41% will go. I will update again later.4/19/23 Update on battery life, I found that if you are using the phone paired with it and using it to take calls it will drain fairly quickly but that is to be expected even the Samsung or iphone smart watches will do that and you have to charge those daily. You should get several weeks of battery without using the phone function, with the phone I would say you can get a week so really that is still great vs other watches with functions like this one has."", 'Mejorar presentacion', ""Great fit,however the speaker started to distort any audio it reproduced.To the extent that I don't utilize it's function for any of the playback options."", ""Liked the watch up untill it quit working. The watch screen is now fuzzy. The watch is advertised as waterproof but apparently it's not. I would shower with the watch never went swimming with it on. I have tried to contact the company and no response. Disappointed with this product and the company.  Hoping that amazon can assist me since I purchased it in march. It lasted 3 1/2 months."", ""So first off I really enjoyed it, the features are nice, it has a snug fit and so far all of the apps seem very accurate for health monitoring. However the issue is I've had this less than 2 days of use and it magically stopped receiving notifications. It was still connected to my phone and hasn't been disconnected for in my work my phone is always close as well as home. I was driving in a vehicle so I know my phone didn't get separated or anything like that. So when I got to the office I restarted my phone and watch and it still didn't work. Did call reset on watch and main reset and it still didn't work. It pairs just fine and seems sturdy and has survived 2 showers so it seems nice and resistant to heat and water. The battery leaves a lot to be desired, with 2 restarts and resets after being fully charged before use and only 2 days time with 40 minutes of talk time the battery was at 8% which shuts off all functions except time basically. So I went into the app and literally made every selection possible again to make sure it registered (yes I had all notifications on the first time) and magically I'm getting notifications again. We will see how long this lasts. I will update review in a week. ****UPDATE**** so I re-downloaded the app and notifications have been coming through just fine. Everything is working as it should and if you can deal without it being smart for a couple days after it hits 8% and goes power save mode let it fully die and then charge it to max and somehow it lasts longer. It's taken a steaming hot shower with me every day and only 1 accidental shower call lol but definitely seems to be water resistant and so far screen protector has a couple marks but it's surviving. I move furniture for a living and it gets put between a couch and a doorway every now and again. Sleep tracking, pulse and steps all seem to be really accurate. I've checked it in comparison to actual monitoring equipment and it's always very close to the mark. May have had some issues in the beginning but for the price it's quite worth it. Can easily spend $250+ for the same thing without calling. Sometimes the speaker sounds laggy or glitchy while calling but normally is intermittent and not constant."", ""Pros: Once connected to your phone, which takes only minutes, it functions amazing. Snappy quick notifications and calls forwarded to the watch. Love the ability to make and take calls using the Bluetooth watch. Beautiful and vibrant color display for the watch face, and the ability to change it to one of dozens of watchfaces seems to give much in the way of variety. Stopwatch, timer functions, your local weather from the watch itself is great! Price is incredibly competitive seeing name brand watches go for triple or more for the same value.Cons: Does not have an always on display, must manually push the buttons on the side or shake the watch to wake it up, which does not always turn the screen on. A quick glance to see the time means you might have to fumble with it for a while or train your brain to push a side button with your free hand when looking at the time. Unfortunately for me - and this is my biggest deal breaker is that the for the watch to function completely in the way it is designed to function, it allows permissions to every square inch of your phone including do not disturb access which allows it to touch all your system settings on your phone. The permissions aren't the concern for me, but I believe the watch is constantly moving my settings around because my phone has had major crashing / restarting, app closures as soon as the screen times out and UI lag during normal operation where it has never had an issue with these things before. I'm not seeing this as a problem in other reviews, and I don't know what's different about my situation but I'm opting to return the device because the two don't play nice with each other.Overall I think it's a tremendous value and very performance worthy but I am not comfortable with the other side effects of having it connected to my phone."", ""Downgrade:  Do not recommend. Watch was working fine and unexpectedly died after 2 weeks!Need a rugged waterproof watch. My Wave Interceptor with solar panel face lasted over 20 years until the buttons wore out.I broke the screens on a Fit Bit and a Nike Fuel Band within a week. My work and hobbies make it easy to smack the face on a hard surface.  If this watch breaks soon I'll update my review.Others noted the choice of watch faces is limited and mostly childish. I agree and am disappointed. The face in the photo is best for me. The others remind me of Anime.  Odd for a watch advertised for men IMO.The watch is comfortable. I tried a much more costly Garmin, but it was so bulky it impaired movement while working with tools and would dig into the back of my hand.  The Tank M1's rectangular shape prevents this problem  while providing an ample touch screen for large fingers.The O2 Sat, BP, and pulse perfectly match the readings from a fingertip device I have and a Lovia Brand biceps arm cuff. I'm amazed by that!The other sports features all work well.Major dislike the phone call feature!  When paired with my Android phone, I can answer and place calls from the watch. That part is nice, like when there's an incoming call and I could miss the call by the time I remove gloves or wash hands.BUT once you answer the call you can't switch to using the phone. You must quit the call, unpair the watch, and call the person back.  I hope this is an app issue that can be fixed, but for my use it's not important enough to hunt for a replacement."", 'El producto no sirve servicio al cliente horrible', 'It was the most expensive smart watch I have ever purchased and lasted me the shortest amount of time. After only a month one of the buttons and the touchscreen are ineffective. Save your money and get something that will last.Edit: The company did reach out to address the issue. Hopefully the replacement will last a little while longer. Gave 4 stars for their customer service skills.']"

Not able to use will return it!!!!"", 'The good news: This is a reasonably powerful budget smart watch, once you learn how to use it.The better news: I\'m raising my rating, thanks to a recent software upgrade that addressed a critical problem. More on that later.I\'ll start with a quick summary of the good, the bad, and the weird.- It\'s a fitness tracker that can track time, steps, and estimated caloric burn for 15 sports.- It monitors and records a WIDE variety of vitals: heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, sleep, blood oxygen, glucose level, and fatigue (whatever that is).- It has NFC (near field communications) capability, useful for things like touchless payment.- It has the usual smart watch things: phone, notifications, alarms, stopwatch, countdown timer.Now the bad:- Documentation is awful, making setup painful. More on that below.- Confusingly, two distinct pairing operations are needed, for phone/audio functionality, and for everything else. More on that below.- NFC currently supports only a few applications, not including Google Pay. (I suspect this is the story for most watches with NFC that aren\'t running WearOS.)- Don\'t expect a lot of accuracy from the vital signs monitors - on this or any smart watch.And the weird:- Like any watch, it will lose and regain its connection to the phone. Unlike most watches, it alerts you whenever it reconnects, lighting up and vibrating. No way to turn that off. That is annoying, especially when returning to bed after a midnight bio break.- When in 12-hour mode, the clock display the hour as ""0"" between midnight and 1 am.- You can\'t use the WearFit Pro app without watching ads.Until the recent software upgrade, the watch had a more serious flaw: every few days, it would reset, losing all saved data and reverting to Chinese language mode. This was pretty much a show-stopper. After my recent upgrade, it looks like that problem has been solved.If you\'re still reading, I\'m going to follow up with a little more detail that, if nothing else, might help you puzzle out this watch faster than I did. FYI, I\'m running with a Moto Android phone.The printed documentation is sparse and in a microscopic font. The documentation provided within the app (WearFit Pro) is confusing and poorly translated. It includes instruction on phone configuration changes you have to do by hand, but only for a few brands of phone: your job is to figure out how/if those instructions apply to you.Pairing was confusing, because this watch requires TWO pairing operations. From the phone\'s Bluetooth configuration, you pair to the ""GT3 Audios"" device. That gives you phone and audio functionality. And from the WearFit Pro app, you pair to the Aigo GT3 watch - that gives you everything else. There\'s nothing about that in the printed doc or app, but you can learn about it by looking through the graphics on the Amazon product page.Bottom line: this watch delivers a fair amount for the money, but has some flaws, and you need patience to get started using it.', ""We thought this would be a better product but I guess the reason the smart watches are so expensive is because they actually work vs this which didn't do all it said."", 'The watch came set up in a language that wasn’t English. Once we figured out how to change the language to English it was slightly easier to setup and pair to my phone. The biggest issue is when in the app, it automatically starts giving pop ups and when you try to x out of them it sends you to the link. It’s quite frustrating. Another thing is the language. It like it was English converted to the language it came in then converted back to English cause since when do we say “replenish moisture” when we should “drink water”? Another thing is the face of the watch changes even though it’s been set to one specific face. It just randomly switches on its own. Overall, I would say this isn’t worth the cost and I don’t think I would have bought it on my own.', 'Was a bit of a hassle trying to figure out how to switch to English but once I figured that out it was easy to connect to my iPhone, simply scanned the QR code and downloaded the app, they have multiple screens to choose from to change the look of the watch, was comfortable to wear and seemed pretty accurate at counting steps and tracking heart rate. Will have to check if they have other band choices available. Definitely cheaper than the Apple Watch that I broke.', 'The watch itself is good quality, but after spending some time in the app, I can’t change the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, and there is still a lot of things still in Japanese. There are a bunch of watch faces, but they almost all cost money and still have Japanese on them. If the app had a serious makeover this watch could be really nice.', 'It’s not Apple and it’s not a Samsung.  I’ve used this watch for about a week. Very affordable smart watch. Extremely comfortable fit. Played music on it. Answered calls. Etc. works as expected. Many watch faces to choose from, some are free, and some cost. Delivers a vibration for notification unless you have it connected to audio as well. I however use Audio glasses 100% of the day so I did not want calls and notifications routed to my watch instead of my glasses. Overall a solid watch. Made well. Comfortable, seems rugged and is definitely water resistant. Did not submerge.  Automatically checked my vitals every hour. Kept perfect steps tracked.']"

It does a good job of giving you an overview, but lacks the details you may find in a smart watch or higher priced devices.

And the vibrating low O2 level alarm is great for keeping my from not dying.  The O2 level alarm is even adjustable, a great feature.  I found the finger piece a little tight even on my pinky, although the discomfort while a slept was minimal.

It reads exactly the same as the expensive big machines in the pulmonary rehab, but continues to read properly further into heavy cardio exercise before getting some interrupted readings from extreme movement.  Surprised it outperformed the pulmonary rehab units... but it did.-  small and light.  I have others and this one is the smallest and lightest continuous monitor I own- easy to connect to your phone and get data.  It just works... nothing special to do or buttons to push, couldn't be easier.  The app found the monitor and asked me for the last four digits of the s/n on the back of the monitor the first time I connected to it.  after that, I just open the app on my phone and it just connects and works.- continuous data.  The fact it logs your readings so often (not like an apple watch that takes it once in a while and only when you are perfectly still) is very helpful to see exactly what makes your O2 saturation drop and for exactly how long, in real time and also historically with the app data.  My doc thinks it's great I have this data for him.- Auto turn on / off - this prevents you from putting it on and going to sleep and not realizing you forgot to turn it on, or maybe accidentally turning it off.  Also, there is no on/off button to malfunction over time.  I was skeptical of this at first, but it makes it foolproof and works flawlessly.- good support.  I asked the company technical questions about the data logging features and the app via email and they were quick to respond and answered thoroughly.- comfortable - this one being fairly small helps it be less noticeable to the wearer during everyday life and while sleeping.Cons:- the battery seems to last all day or all night and then some, but if you are one who needs to wear it 24/7, it requires more charging sessions per day than the long battery life versions.  The vast majority of people buying these will never need to wear one of these 24/7, so this is irrelevant for most... and the small size is a great tradeoff for battery life for people who just use for exercise and/or sleep monitoring.- The cable for the finger sensor comes out right at your wrist and if you wear really low on your wrist will sometimes hit your hand if you bend it all the way back.  Probably not great on that connector over time either.  It's not really been an issue, but I think could be one day with heavy use.- The price is a bit high.  Of course, it is a continuous monitor and has a great app and logs data, and given all that the price is reasonable given its a premium product and just works, but if you don't need all the premium features, the premium price is... well... premium.  It did have a $35 coupon when I purchased it making the price $144.99 which is much more palatable than the original price of $179.99."", ""I use a pulse ox monitor for tracking sleep apnea and general health, and this OxyU device is a great compromise between smartwatches/fitness trackers (not always accurate) and medical grade devices (less comfortable to wear, and more expensive).Comfort:As shown in the product pictures, the OxyU consists of a wristband (with the digital display), as well as a wired finger sensor (connects via micro USB to the wristband). The wristband was comfortable to wear and feels less intrusive and lighter than a typical smartwatch or fitness tracker. The finger sensor is also easy to wear and allows a range of motion. It is easier to wear than than pulse ox rings as the bulk of the device is not on your finger but in a more comfortable spot on your wrist.I was unable to determine if the wristband itself can be replaced easily, but it would be nice if the ViBeat store had other wristband options if they can be replaced (with different colors, etc.).Accuracy:I compared the SpO2 and HR values with a standard fingertip pulse oximeter, as well as my O2Ring, and the values were accurate between each. I don't believe most consumer devices have medical grade accuracy, but I did find that the OxyU matched the generally more accurate fingertip pulse oximeter, versus smartwatches and other fitness trackers.One advantage of the OxyU is that the data is recorded continuously and not every few minutes like with some smartwatches or fitness trackers. As shown in the screenshot image, you can see the real-time data flow through the mobile app and easily see changes in SpO2 and HR as they happen! There is also a motion indicator that is tracked in real-time as well, which is nice to have as a reference for sleep tracking and sleep apnea monitoring.User interfaces:The device is easy-to-use as it has automatic on/off functionality as soon as you put the device is on. Once turned on, the display shows SpO2, HR and battery level and is easy to read. The mobile application easily pairs with the device via Bluetooth. The real-time tracking is also easy to understand, and the historical data is accessible from the mobile app as well. You can zoom into each day's data to get more specific information down to the minute, etc.Overall, I found the OxyU to be a convenient and easy-to-use device for sleep monitoring!

This would be better accomplished with a Bluetooth headset which allows you to skip or pause.Cannot control music on the watch. Will not Bluetooth to a headset/earbuds.

The coordinates were wrong, the app crashed and it only connected to the app through wifi which is not the point.. the point is for the watch to use the line's internet (unlimited btw) not to depend on wifi in order to track and all of the mentioned.I got ahold of customer service, they only chat, you can't call. The responses were delayed and they kept changing agents while talking to one (the name appeared differently 4 times).I did all troubleshooting required by them sent text commands.. change the sim card from the watch to my phone to make sure the internet worked, which it did.Apparently the watch uses 2g (even though it states 4g) and this was told to me by the live agent from find my kids app. At&t stopped supporting 2g since 2017.I tried to factory reset the watch to return it through Amazon but the commands did not work and the remote factory reset could not be performed, the agent stated the watch was disconnected even though it was connected to the wifi and was connected through app visible to me.. so I don't know.. all I know is that I spent literally 4hrs (I'm not exaggerating) trying to fix it.

Had me sitting in the driveway in this almost hundred degree weather because it kept saying to go outside to get a more accurate read. Each time it never got the right house number. I gave up on that and had to just say my neighbors house was our address because for whatever reason the watch couldn’t find our address. Then, I connected it to my phone and was figuring out the settings, it got connected to the wifi easy but when I was trying to click the mobile part there were no viable options as mobile carriers to choose.

It only shows the approximate location when outside the building, but the rest of the time - not located, not connected, and none of the functions work at all. Tried even connecting to school wifi - still nothing.And due to the fact that we had to wait for the school to start to check it - the return window closed :( so we are left with a piece of plastic for the price of a gadget.HERE'S AN UPDATE:The seller reached out to me shortly after I left the negative review, though I did not even think of writing to them as I obviously missed the return date. Nevertheless, the seller was very customer-oriented and tried to figure out how to make it work. Unfortunately, it did not help to make the gadget work in my case but I was offered a refund for that. So I should say that the customer service was really helpful."", 'The parent app for the device is a bit cumbersome and it is clear it’s translated from Chinese based set up. Regular SMS messaging is hard to do as their isn’t a QWERTY style screen keyboard but rather a phone button letter keys where you click on the button that has the letter in the group then pick that letter. Then go back to the group list for the next letter. My son wasn’t thrilled with this.The call function works well and programming numbers is easy. Blocking unknown numbers also worked well though there wasn’t a way to do this for texts. He got some weird ones.We never got to set up the schedule app. The GPS tracker worked well and was accurate.We tried to put the WhatsApp on it. It loaded fine but we could never get the confirmation text to go through. The SIM card was easy to install and worked fine with SpeedTalk (TMobile network). The family message app wasn’t too helpful as he or I would send a message through it but wouldn’t get an alert that we had a message to view.The biggest down side is about 3 weeks after getting it set up, it just stopped powering on. My son but it on the charger for low battery. Waited until it was nearly full 98% and when he took it off the charger it would no longer power on. If it was placed back on the charger the screen would show the power percent screen but wouldn’t go anywhere else. The watch wouldn’t power on to the OS or the main function screen.There was not contact for customer service in the box or on the purchase page. So we sent it back for a refund.Disappointing. I would have tried some of the other kids’ watch optima but most require and built in sim and to use more expensive service. $10-20 a month is more than I want to pay for a watch to text and call. I only pay $24 a month for much more access on my iPhone. I ended up purchasing an adult watch which took a SIM card and it’s working much better for him. It’s Android based so I can do all the same functions with the Google Family Link app which loads right on it and it’s glitchy like the one for this (which also had ads?!).UPDATE:Customer Service for the seller contacted me and has sent a replacement Watch free of charge. I have updated the stars to 4. I will give another update after using the new watch.', 'I had a lot of connection issues with the watch. After contacting customer support, they responded very quickly and offered step-by-step instructions to help me. They were very fast in their responses. They were friendly and easy to work with.

SO...you know. NO.---ORIGINAL REVIEWI got this watch for my 7 year old daughter to use while I’m working at the local park. I don’t even know where to begin.The Watch and the app needed to use the watch are both INCREDIBLY frustrating. I haven’t felt this angry over a device in YEARS! It’s not user friendly at all, and I am a tech-savvy person.I’m not sure if it’s just not as compatible with my phone as advertised, or if it’s how the Watch is meant to work, or if it’s because I live in Alaska; but the GPS isn’t working accurately. It just says the Device is Disconnected, but I know it’s not. It only seems to register if my daughter is right next to me, which completely defeats the whole purpose of this device.I had to allow Unknown Callers to call my iPhone in order for her call to come through, even though I added her as a contact (with the number given after registering the Nano SIM card). I tried several different ways to get her call to come through without success until I disabled that feature on my phone: something I vehemently did not want to do.I had to disable the No Stranger Contact on her watch in order for someone in her contact list to call her.All the safety features that made me want this for my daughter are not only frustrating to set up, but don’t work the way I need or want them to.For how much this cost (plus the cost of the Nano SIM card to use it the way it’s intended), I expected an easier to use product that works as advertised.I’m considering whether or not it’s worth keeping or if I should return it. I wanted the peace of mind, and all it’s given me is an abundance of irritation and frustration.I do not recommend this product at all. I wouldn’t give this even one star if that was an option.""]"

I have never walked 99,999 steps in a day. The sleep information is often incorrect, sometimes recording more sleep than the entire time I was in my bedroom, sometimes recording just 3 hours of sleep when I know I got at least 8. The watch is cheap and at least initially appears to work just fine. I don\'t know if my unit is unique in this regard. Minus 1 star for that.Their software ""F Fit"" is proprietary, it does not integrate directly with Google Fit. Their software interface records a data log but you can\'t look at the data anywhere else or perform week to week or month to month comparisons. Only individual days and some of the graphs don\'t let you click on a specific portion to return a value. Very frustrating. If they\'re going to force you to use their software at least they should give you the ability to export the data for analysis. Minus 1 star for that.The watch\'s interface is extremely archaic. Reminds of those old windows mobile phones from the mid 2000\'s. It is cheap so don\'t be surprised. The scroll feel is actually not very intuitive amd it takes a bit to get accustomed to. You\'ll find yourself scrolling through a bunch of options you don\'t care about to end up where you want.The feature of turning on the display when tilting up the watch to your face is far too annoyingly slow. After lifting up your hand you\'ll stare at a blank watch for a second before you can see anything. In that second you might push the button on the side thinking it didn\'t work, only to immediately shut the display off after it flashes for a brief second. It also doesn\'t have adjustment to control how long it stays lit so inevitably it will turn off while you\'re reading something and you will have to turn it on again. Very annoying.The feature to vibrate and display notifications could probably be useful to some people but you can\'t read a full text without scrolling. I suppose this would be a selling point for some people but I just turned it off because most notifications I get don\'t require direct attention and I have to open my phone often anyway.The display is too dim to read in open sunlight without shading somehow and its too bright when it turns in randomly while you\'re in bed sleeping. Sometimes you\'ll move your arm by your head and be blasted by light while you\'re trying to sleep. Really annoying.One good thing is the battery is super easy and quick to charge. In my experience it needs a boost every 4-5 days and it can fully charge while I\'m taking a quick shower. The magnetic cord is nice.Overall I think it\'s about as good as it can be for the price. I\'m still on the fence if I want to keep it or spend hundreds more on something better engineered. Sill on my wrist for the time being.', ""Pros:Unique feature - calibration of the blood pressure seems working Ok. Still it is not a medical device.Unique feature - temperature measurement seems working Ok.Comfy silicone belt.Some may like small watch size.Cons:It is not possible to initiate the measurement of any parameter other than blood pressure from the application. You must do this on the clock itself.The raise wrist feature doesn't always work, and there's no way to have it off for the night hours, which is inconvenient.The screen is small and low resolution. I wish I had all the features in a larger case like the Kospet SN80Y. Especially it is important if you read messages on the screen often.Very limited set of dials. Only one looks good.You have to manually press the sync button in the app. Simply opening the application does not always initiate data synchronization.There is no indication of sleep quality on the watch screen. Just the total number of hours of sleep. You need to use the app to see the duration of the deep and light sleep.Make sure you don't have hair where the watch touches your wrist. Otherwise, the blood pressure measurement will be incorrect."", 'No se porque lo llaman deportivo. Solo con el deporte de caminar no te dice la distancia ni el ritmo cardíaco.

Gli orologi tattili e quelli parlanti comunemente venduti non sono esteticamente bellissimi e non costano poco! Allora, mi sono detta, perché non provare uno smartwatch, che ha sicuramente molte più funzioni ed è diventato ormai un must?Tra le persone non vedenti è diffusa la convinzione che il top per funzionalità ed accessibilità sia lo smartwatch di una marca blasonata, dal costo proibitivo. Avendo io uno smartphone Samsung, ho provato ad acquistare questo modello, sempre Samsung, il cui costo di listino dovrebbe aggirarsi attorno ai 260 euro, ma che ho trovato su Amazon in offerta a 140 euro.Non mi è sembrato vero, poiché essendo venduto e spedito da Amazon, avrei avuto la possibilità di valutarlo con attenzione e di restituirlo, nel caso non fossi riuscita ad utilizzarlo.L'articolo è arrivato nel giro di 3 o 4 giorni, ben protetto in una confezione lunga e stretta.All'interno ho trovato, oltre allo smartwatch, la base di ricarica, senza alimentatore (io utilizzo quello del mio smartphone Samsung) ed il manuale di istruzioni. Tutto perfettamente integro, nessun graffio, nessuna ammaccatura, anche la scatola è perfetta.Come può una persona che non vede configurare uno smartwatch? Vi confesso che ero un po' preoccupata. Mi sono fatta assistere da un occhio. Il device ha solo 2 pulsanti: indossandolo, quello in alto è il tasto di accensione e fa anche da tasto home, quello in basso, per intenderci quello più vicino al proprio corpo, è il tasto back, per tornare indietro in un percorso. Acceso lo smartwatch, bisogna scegliere la lingua e poi il paese. A questo punto il device si riavvia e sullo schermo compaiono 2 o 3 opzioni, tra cui Generale e Accessibilità. Accessibilità era quella che mi interessava e infatti, chiedendo di cliccarci sopra, è stato possibile attivare subito Talkback, un lettore di schermo che legge appunto tutto quello che compare a schermo e che consente, anche ad una persona che non vede, di interagire con lo smartwatch toccandolo: i gesti sono un po' diversi da quelli consueti, con un solo tocco si esplora, con un doppio tocco si attiva, ecc. La sintesi vocale ha iniziato subito a parlare in Italiano, utilizzando una voce Samsung, alla quale io sono già abituata.A questo punto, dopo solo qualche minuto dall'apertura della confezione, ho potuto proseguire in totale autonomia. Ho attivato il bluetooth sul mio smartphone, scaricato l'app Galaxy Wearable ed i 2 dispositivi si sono abbinati ed è iniziata la configurazione, quasi completamente automatica.Toccando una volta lo schermo, questo si attiva e posso ascoltare l'ora. Ho poi impostato delle notifiche con vibrazione, per sapere quando mi arrivano messaggi e telefonate. Riesco a rispondere e a rifiutare le chiamate con estrema rapidità, il touch mi sembra più performante di quello del mio telefono. Le chiamate si sentono bene (ovviamente vanno in vivavoce) ed anche i miei interlocutori si sono detti soddisfatti.Posso leggere mail e messaggi Whatsapp, ma io sinceramente preferisco farlo da smartphone, anche perché rispondere da smartwatch è complicato. Riesco a farlo utilizzando la dettatura vocale, ma non è un metodo discreto, in alcune situazioni non va bene.Il dispositivo è dotato anche di un assistente vocale proprietario, Bixby, al quale chiedo ad esempio il livello di carica della batteria oppure di effettuare delle chiamate, senza farlo manualmente dalla rubrica.Con una carica del 100%, che si ottiene in poco più di un'ora, l'orologio dovrebbe avere un'autonomia di un giorno e 15 ore. Io riesco a fare 2 giorni pieni, però di notte lo spengo.Devo aggiungere di aver disattivato diverse opzioni legate alla salute e allenamento, tipo la rilevazione cardiaca, che a me non servono.Ho avuto una sola difficoltà iniziale: l'orologio si attivava in continuazione e non ne capivo la ragione. Poi ho scoperto che c'è un'opzione da disattivare, quella che risveglia l'orologio ogni volta che si muove il polso.L'unico mio cruccio è stato inizialmente di non riuscire ad attivare un'opzione che mi piace, presente tra quelle di accessibilità: si può fare in modo, poggiando le dita sullo schermo, che vibri per consentire di conoscere ore e minuti. Si rivela davvero utile, poiché si può consultare l'ora senza far parlare l'orologio in situazioni in cui non sono sola. Alla fine ci sono riuscita, andando in Impostazioni Accessibilità, Funzioni avanzate. L'opzione si chiama Orol. vibrazione. Tappandoci su, si può scegliere tra vibrazione numerica e vibrazione decimale. Di default è impostata la vibrazione numerica, che però non funzionava: non volendo lasciare nulla di intentato, sono passata alla decimale per poi tornare alla numerica e, all'improvviso, l'orologio ha iniziato a funzionare nella maniera desiderata. Questa opzione funziona con il lettore di schermo attivo o disattivo. E' utile quindi anche alle persone che vedono e che, magari, durante una noiosissima riunione, non vogliono far notare che guardano continuamente l'ora. Toccando con 2 dita il quadrante una sola volta, si può conoscere l'ora attraverso delle vibrazioni: se sono le 18, sentiremo una vibrazione lunga e 8 brevi. Per conoscere i minuti, invece, si deve sempre toccare il quadrante con 2 dita, ma per 2 volte. Se i minuti sono 27, sentiremo 2 vibrazioni lunghe e 7 brevi. In genere sappiamo sempre che ora è, vogliamo conoscere solo i minuti, quindi dovremo compiere una sola operazione, toccando discretamente l'orologio, senza dare nell'occhio. Questa funzione era già presente sugli orologi Tissot di una quindicina di anni fa.Ribadisco infine che tutte le schermate dello smartwatch e quelle dell'app Galaxy Wearable sono completamente accessibili.L'orologio ha conquistato tutti, soprattutto per l'elegante rosa antico, alcune colleghe sono intenzionate a comprarlo esattamente identico. Non lo trovo pesante e non è molto grande, seppure il mio polso sia sottile. Il cinturino è in silicone e spesso non lo tolgo quando mi lavo e finora non ho riscontrato problemi.Sono soddisfattissima del mio acquisto, spendendo poco più di 100 euro mi ritrovo tra le mani un gioiellino di tecnologia ed eleganza. Spero che la mia recensione sia utile a futuri acquirenti."", 'I like many others didn\'t do my homework and purchased this watch to act as an early warning system in case my blood pressure fluctuates.  I knew this watch couldn\'t do blood pressure readings everywhere but it didn\'t occur to me that the good \'ole USofA was one of those counties.  I get why the FDA is draging their heals on this since lawyers are abundant here, but it would be nice if Samsung could offer this as a ""use at your own risk, no liability until we are FDA approved"" disclaimer since this red tape is just BS getting into a perfectly logical use case that shouldn\'t be legal binding in the first place (it\'s a blood watch.....)  I knock this product one star since they shouldn\'t be shipping it with the watch band that it comes with, I get it, it\'s fancy and unique.... great then again some people are allergic to materials like that and *everyone* is going to sweat like a facuet with that material glued to their wrist.  I have a nice after market metal band that breaths and the watch is adjustable magnetically so I question why you didn\'t just offer something like that from the get go instead of the ""science experiment glued by sweat to your wrist"".The lack of blood pressure monitoring in the states would have dropped this to 3 stars (I know they don\'t advertise it so aggressively anymore, I didn\'t do my homework so that\'s on me), but at least I found a new use for the watch in the mean time while my fingers are crossed the FDA finally approves these things handy things given folks like myself are not looking for accruracy but early warning my blood pressure is going off the rails so I can strap a proper monitor on my arm and try to doogie howard my way through it.  Getting a health problem all at once isn\'t helping things and I wish the FDA would recognize that, it\'s not like we have blood pressure cuffs strapped on oursleves 24/7 .....  I constantly have my cell phone on vibrate mode and I often miss calls and other notifications as a result.  Having a ""Dick Tracy gadget"" strapped to my wrist is notifying me of all kinds of stuff that went under my radar previously.  I think my 4 stars is valid, they jumped the gun and marked this product inresponsibly just like the 4 series when it comes to BP measurements, but upon review I don\'t see anything on this page that suggest blood pressure monitoring was a thing as of the time of my purchase so I think it was a bit slimmy in the early days I don\'t think anyone doing their homework who has common sense would be tricked by some old out of date claims they read online.My only Samsung ask....... hire some lobbists or something to speed things up...... I know dealing with the goverment (FDA) is a nightmare but your (much cheaper competitors) are sliding past somehow so greese some skids, this is murica!  PS, thanks for not making my recent galaxy watch 5 pro purchase not instantly obsolete with the 6 series :)', 'Though I haven\'t really had this watch long enough to be giving too much of an review, I decided that I am still going to review it and edit as needed because I am already in love with this watch. First things first, for those that are having trouble downloading the Samsung health monitor app for this watch, just click on the Samsung health monitor app icon inside of the watch and then check your phone to follow up on the download from there. I am hearing a lot of people talking about the blood pressure sensor with this watch, so far I haven\'t found that yet as I am still going through the watch and getting to know it at the same time, if by chance I do find it and it doesn\'t work like I\'m hearing it doesn\'t in the United States, I\'m not going to worry too much because as long as the option is there, there\'s hope through updates, something you will need to do time you get this watch through the Galaxy Wearable app. I will still continue to use my Galaxy Watch 4 42mm for work, and being though this watch is bigger and more elegant, it\'s going to be the one that I wear on my off days to have something decent to wear when I go out to a nice place. I was having a extremely hard time getting this gem paired with my Galaxy S23 Ultra, but after awhile I noticed that this was due to fault of my own for not realizing at the time that I had to disable my ad blocker/VPN. After this was done everything went smooth from there, so do keep this in mind when setting up this watch. I am hearing other say that this watch will not work with other phone brands, people.... it\'s a Samsung watch, it was made and meant to be paired with Samsung products particularly Samsung Galaxy phones. This is only normal for anything, whereas you wouldn\'t pair this watch with a iPhone nor would you pair a Apple Watch with a Samsung Galaxy phone. They were meant to be matched up with their own brands. At last, at last..... a product that doesn\'t say ""Made in China"", this watch should last for years people. It has far more features than my Galaxy watch 4 with the rotating bezel which is cool to have but not all that, because it feels that one day, it\'s going to play out. With this gem, I don\'t have to worry about that because there is no rotating bezel. The only thing that I don\'t like so far is that Samsung replaced their own store with Play Store making it hard, if not impossible to get my purchased watch faces downloaded to this watch. ""Update"", after having this watch longer and getting to know it better I can say that this was a very good purchase made. It\'s so many things that Samsung has upgraded on this one. It has a much better GPS system in place that seems to work pretty much like the same system that\'s inside the Galaxy S23 Ultra, that ""ultra wideband"" feature. Even when I sleep in the watch, the battery lasts for days, also pretty much like the Galaxy S23 Ultra. The two combined couldn\'t be a better pair, both are very similar. This watch has seemed to have added some extra features in the Samsung health app. The sleep part of the watch is very accurate, far better than my first generation Galaxy watch. This thing is a must have. Getting just a bit personal, I do wish that Samsung had made this watch bigger, say.... 48mm. However, it still do what it do. This thing has even got Google Assistant. I will gladly recommend this watch to anyone in search of a awesome smartwatch with all the bells and whistles, not to mention the latest technology. Who said that you can\'t have your cake and eat it to.', '1- Duración de la batería ridícula.· Teniendo el reloj con el ahorro de energía activado y todas las funciones cómo sueño, estrés, pulsaciones.. etc, desactivadas o configuradas de manera que se hagan lo menos posible, la batería de este duraba cómo mucho un día y medio.· Teniéndolo todo activado y con el ahoro de energía desactivado, la duración de la batería duraba cómo mucho un día.· Si además de esto haces deporte o eres de los que reciben muchas notificaciones y estás mirando cada dos por tres el reloj, si te dura 4-6 horas es un milagro.· Si por casualidad activas la opción de detectar ronquidos mientras duermes, estos se escuchan desde el móvil (no entiendo por que teniendo el reloj micrófono depende del móvil, pero bueno...) y prepárate para que esta función gaste un 20-30% de batería de tu teléfono cada noche.2- Mal funcionamiento de los Sensores.· Soy una persona que en reposo está a unas 50-55 ppm y comparando los valores del reloj con un tensiometro solo puedo decir que la experiencia ha sido decepcionante. Mientras que a veces el reloj me marcaba que estaba a unas 90 pulsaciones, el tensiometro me marcaba unas 55. A veces hasta funcionaba y me marcaba ppm similares, pero lo más normal era que el 90% de las veces ni se acercaban a un valor real o parecido.· Medidor de óxigeno en sangre funcionaba relativamente bien.· El sensor de estrés es ridículo... Nunca me bajó del nivel ""Rojo"", o sea ser que según este siempre estaba muy estresado... No sé en qué se basará para decirte si estás estresado o no, pero no es ni medio fiable. Me gustaría añadir que soy una persona por lo general muy tranquila y que quizás dos o tres veces en mi vida, y por cuestión de trabajo, he estado estresado.· El sensor de sueño más de lo mismo, por poner un ejemplo: si estás tumbado en el chase long viendo una serie tan tranquilo, pues alomejor le da por detectar que estás durmiendo y si estás tumbado en la cama sin poder dormir por que tienes insomnio o problemas similares con el sueño, tranquilo, según el reloj dormirás plácidamente.· Los sensores de ECG y PA no los pude probar, ya que si no tienes un teléfono Samsung, no van a funcionar, ya que requieren de la app de Samsung Health Monitor, y solo se pueden descargar a través de la store de Samsung ya que en Play Store no se encontraba esta. Se pueden descargar versiones antiguas de la app que estuvieron en su día en la Play Store, pero ya te tienes que estar bajando APKs de terceros que no sabes si van a ser maliciosas o no, personalmente yo no me la jugué.3- El GPS es más lento que el caballo del malo de cualquier peliícula del Vaqueros.· En casa (Pleno centro de Barcelona), la señal tardaba aproximadamente unos 2 minutos en cogerme señal, en la calle minuto y medio más o menos.· La señal deja mucho que desear y a veces la pierde. Tengo que decir que en un principio escogí este reloj al tener Watch OS para poder llevar el maps en este, y yendo en moto, dependiendo del reloj, era un desastre... Además de esto solo te muestra señalizaciones y no el mapa cómo tal una vez inicias ruta y lo peor de todo es que a veces te vibraba para mostrarte la señalización, y otras veces no.. inexplicable.4- Notificaciones sorprendentes.· Hay que decir que el nivel de las notificaciones era sobresaliente. Si te mandaban un mensaje por cualquier App de mensajería, lo podías ver todo, imagenes, stickers.. excepto videos y la verdad es que se veía todo con una calidad excelente. Y con los correos lo mismo.5- Funcionamiento con agua regulero.· Si por casualidad te metías en la ducha o en la piscina sin haber activado antes la función de funcionamiento en agua, la habías liado, por que la pantalla, además de no funcionar, era cómo las luces de una discoteca, no paraba de iluminarse y apagarse. Y si por casualidad te acordabas de activar dicha función, la pantalla no se iluminaba, pero si querías mirar una notificación ya ni podías por que la pantalla a penas funcionaba, si es que lo hacía...6- Altavoz y micrófono muy eficientes.· He cogido un par de llamadas desde el reloj y la verdad que se escuchaba bastante nítido y desde el otro lado ni se daban cuenta que hablaba desde este. Así que en este aspecto estoy muy sorprendido ya que realmente está muy logrado. Pero no nos engañemos, teniendo el teléfono a mano, esto es una función que utilizarás una vez al mes cómo mucho y ya está.7- Valoración general 3/10.· Esto es un quiero y no puedo, tienen mucho que mejorar y por hacer.· Si ya me molesta casi tener que cargar el móvil cada 3-4 días, ya que soy una persona que no lo utiliza mucho, tener que cargar este reloj cada día o casi cada día, era ridículo...· Si te lo compras por tener un GPS de muñeca, no es ni siquiera una buena solución.· Si lo que buscas es tener unos buenos sensores, pasa de largo.· Si no tienes un móvil Samsung, estás limitado ya que hay funciones que no te van a funcionar.· Llamadas muy nítidas por ambas partes y funcionan muy bien pero esto lo utilizarás nada y menos.Por lo general no le recomendaría esta compra a nadie.Si lo que quieres es un reloj, cómprate uno, no un ""Smartwatch"".Si lo que quieres es tener que estar mirando las notificaciones cada dos segundos en tu muñeca, siento decirte que tienes un problema con este tema.Si lo que quieres es un ""GPS"" esto no es ni parecido.Si lo que quieres son buenos sensores, cómprate un tensiometro y un detector de óxigeno en sangre.Si lo que quieres es un artilugio caro para coger llamadas además de un móvil, y no te molesta estar cargándolo cada día, es una buena opción.Si vas a hacer deportes acuaticos y estás pensando en comprarte este reloj, buscate otro modelo que no sea este.Respecto a deportes cómo correr o ciclísmo, no puedo dar opinión ya que no lo he probado en estos aspectos.Saludos y espero que mi opinión, aunque sea algo ""criticona"" os haya servido de algo.', ""Bought this phone on Amazon but have service with Verizon.the cost was minimal to have service with verizon with it paired with my phone and sharing the same number. I have it paired with a galaxy S23 ultra. This is my first experience with a smart watch, had it about a week now. When I got the phone I was wondering what it can do with and without the phone. When it's with the phone it paired with the phone and calls go through the phone I can still talk and hear over the watch, can answer the phone with watch or phone and can switch what I'm talking over. When the phone is not there or off I can answer and make calls on the watch stand alone. I paired it with a set of ear bud 2's. I also paired it with my car. Only one at a time, but it has a menu to go back and forth. Was able to play music with the ear buds or through  the media player  in my car, could not get music through the watch speaker. Accidentally got in shower with it didn't stay long don't know if  it got wet or not took it off right away, but it survived. Have not used much of  her apps yet only added Spotify for using at the suggestion of a Friend, first experience  of using phone for music. Still like cd's. I cant tell you much about other features yet. I don't think the heart monitor is as fast as a dedicated monitor like polar but it does measure it. It comes with it's own magnetic charger, no plug in though. I'd suggest getting a second one and keep it in the car,the strap gets in the way of putting it on a regular cordless charger. Hope this helps if your looking at a galaxy watch. By the way it's only $20 more for the lte version over the blue tooth one and can still be used just with the watch if you chose not to use the stand alone phone features."", 'Llevo ya casi un año con este producto y actualmente sigue siendo de mis mejores compras, siempre he tenido relojes de este tipo desde apple watch cuando tenia iphone hasta huawei, honor, xiaomi, ticwatch, etcY este de Samsung me parece el mejor por varios aspectosActualizaciones: me parece que va durar mas que cualquier otro en su segmento.

Unas dos horas para un reloj me parece mucho.', ""Comprato come regalo per mia moglie, posso dirvi che ne sono stato subito invidioso e a momenti lo tenevo per me xD. Il Samsung Galaxy Watch4 è senza dubbio uno dei migliori smartwatch in rapporto qualità/prezzo disponibili sul mercato, e la sua precisione nelle funzioni di monitoraggio salute e fitness tracker ne è la prova tangibile. Questo dispositivo è una perfetta combinazione di tecnologia avanzata e design elegante, fornendo un'esperienza utente senza pari.La precisione delle funzioni di monitoraggio salute e fitness tracker è semplicemente eccezionale. Il sensore sul retro dell'orologio monitora costantemente il battito cardiaco, consentendoti di tenere traccia delle tue attività fisiche con estrema precisione. Che tu stia correndo, facendo yoga o deadlift, il Galaxy Watch4 tiene costantemente sotto controllo i tuoi parametri, fornendoti dati affidabili per valutare e migliorare le tue prestazioni.La funzione ECG è un vero e proprio salvavita, poiché è in grado di rilevare tempestivamente eventuali anomalie del ritmo cardiaco, offrendo un avviso tempestivo in caso di potenziali problemi cardiaci. Questa caratteristica è particolarmente apprezzata da chiunque si preoccupi seriamente della propria salute. Ovviamente NON DEVE ESSERE ASSOLUTAMENTE intesa come sostituta di una visita cardiologica (mi sento stupido anche a doverlo specificare xD).Una delle caratteristiche più impressionanti è la lunga durata della batteria. Nonostante il monitoraggio costante delle attività e delle notifiche, la batteria riesce a durare per tutta la giornata senza problemi. Anche durante le attività fisiche intense o la riproduzione di musica in streaming, il Galaxy Watch4 mantiene un'efficienza energetica notevole.La stabilità del Bluetooth è un altro aspetto che merita un plauso. La connessione Bluetooth tra l'orologio e il telefono è costante e affidabile, evitando disconnessioni improvvise e assicurandoti di ricevere notifiche in tempo reale. Questa caratteristica è essenziale per tutti quelli che vogliono rimanere sempre connessi, senza perdere neanche un messaggio o una chiamata importante.Ma la vera stella di questa esperienza è l'app a cui si collega. La vasta gamma di funzioni integrate ti consente di ricevere ed effettuare telefonate direttamente dall'orologio, rispondere ai messaggi, leggere le email e gestire le notifiche di WhatsApp in modo rapido e intuitivo. Questa sinergia tra l'orologio e l'app è semplicemente sorprendente, e permette di gestire la tua vita digitale in modo fluido e senza interruzioni.In conclusione, il Samsung Galaxy Watch4 è per me un gioiello tecnologico che offre prestazioni Top ad un prezzo Smart! Se cerchi uno smartwatch all'avanguardia ad un prezzo contenuto, il Galaxy Watch4 è la scelta perfetta!"", ""Arrivato con scatola sigillata, quindi nuovo per fortuna.Preso in offerta come il mio vecchio smatwatch, un honor. A meno di 150 euro lo consiglio vivamente per le funzioni che ha.Posso finalmente rispondere al telefono e mandare/ascoltare audio WhatsApp.Peccato però aver scoperto che da un po' di tempo non ci sia più telegram sullo store.L'unica pecca è la durata della batteria, dura poco più di un giorno a differenza di altri smartwatch con durata di 4-5 giorni.Però si sa, più funzioni ha l'orologio, meno durata ha la batteria.Non so se sia una coincidenza ma dall'aggiornamento a UI 5 arriva anche a un giorno e mezzo.Consiglio comunque soprattutto adesso che è calato di prezzo e con l'aggiornamento di UI 5."", ""Prodotto molto bello sia esteticamente che funzionalmente. Avevo bisogno di uno smartwatch per il lavoro, che mi notificasse chiamate e messaggi in quanto non posso utilizzare lo smartphone. Ho trovato questo smartwatch ben strutturato, ottimo quadrante molto luminoso e facile da utilizzare, ottima compatibilità con smartphone Android. Il bluetooth molto reattivo e stabile, lo smartphone lo riconosce subito e si sincronizza immediatamente. Non si disconnette mai!Dotato di vibrazione e audio molto buoni, utilizzabile anche per chiamate in vivavoce, ottimo anche per chi fa allenamento (l'ho utilizzato per trekking e l'ho trovato perfetto).L'unica pecca è la batteria che dura un po poco..io lo ricarico ogni sera...tuttavia la ricarica è molto rapida.Lo consiglio..."", ""I've used a couple other smart watches of lesser value and had issues with the functionality and navigation. I have been using this watch now for a month and I'm very happy with it. I'm not using the cellular activation only the Bluetooth. I pair it with my Samsung Galaxy s23 ultra. I don't like carrying my phone around with me when I'm doing my workout or fixing things around the house . This allows me to get all my notifications and incoming phone calls . It handles notifications from various apps perfectly, controls my Bluetooth speaker in the garage and monitors my health status without errors or issues. Navigating the watch screen is very intuitive. I love all the different watch face selections and customizations you can do. I've added a black cover and screen protector to my watch and they fit very well. The magnetic clasp is super convenient to pop the watch off and on when needed. So far I've been able to use it in my workouts and daily activities and it hasn't gotten damaged or fallen off. I sleep with the watch on so it can monitor my sleep and because it also has a do not disturb function that prevents the watch from lighting up at night if I move around. Cleaning it is fairly simple and the bands just pop right off with a little lever underneath the watch. I use the built in water tight function when I'm washing it. The battery life is pretty good. If I put it on battery saving mode I can run it for about 4 days between charges. If I turn off battery saving mode which basically just allows you to bring the watch up to eye level and it will turn on the sceen, it will run for about 2-3 days Very happy with this purchase and would recommend this watch.""]"

I have reached out to support a few times with no response to my problems I am having with the watch.  The watch has some amazing feature for the price and most of the feature work. The main issue is the watch face goes blank randomly and I have to power it off and on to get it to respond, this happens multiple times a day.  It would be nice to be able to choose what apps you would like alerts from.  If you turn on messages, you get every alert that goes to your phone, and I get a lot in a day from all sorts of apps etc so the watch never silences. My previous watch allowed me to pick what apps I wanted alerts from this one has preset apps you can choose, or you get everything. The health counters are fairly good, Temperature and Blood Pressure are questionable a lot of the times, but I take it with a grain of salt as more directional right than a pure number. The other issue I have is when you attach the watch to your phone through Bluetooth, I don't want my media playing through the watch and although I turn it off the ability to do media playback it will connect back somehow.  Once you connect the watch Bluetooth too it will enable the phone and it will enable to the phone a lot of the times and I don't want my watch being my phone most of the time but if you don't do connect it you will not get text messages.

I actually don't need the feature as my dog is border trained and fully obedient, but I DID need that feature due to the requirements of my neighborhood association...needing some sort of physical or electronic fence in order to allow the dog off a leash on my property.\xa0\xa0The Dogtra Pathfinder 2 meets that need.\xa0 Dogtra smartly added the e fence feature to the Pathfinder line in the Pathfinder 2, and it completely meets the requirement.\xa0In addition, the PF2 seems to have better GPS and quicker connections, as well as a host of new features that really make it easier and more customizable for each use case from simple location or activity tracker to non-sighted hunting.My newest pup is now 7 months old and around 40 pounds and doesn't mind the collar at all. Again, I've only used the features to alert the dog via the collar tone/nick a few times as I believe training is the key, not relying on the collar to control the dog.\xa0 However, all the features are easily accessible in the app and the basic controls are possible without using the phone at all, which I love for our morning runs.The tracker is more accurate than others I've used, and have been able to verify my dog's location across my 5 acres of thick brush and water as the Pathfinder series has serious range...up to 9 miles (!) on the Pathfinder 2.\xa0 Offline maps is a also a game changer, as I'm sometimes in areas without cell tower coverage.\xa0\xa0The PF2 app (it's not the same app as the original Pathfinder series) includes a recording function as well, which is great for hunts to recount what areas were covered, as well as for runs to recount distance, speed, etc.  There's so many features...it really is recommended to read the entire well written guide book fully to get a feel for all the features and customizations.Only a few things I'd recommend Dogtra work on...The on/off process...you really need to count to 3, and if you hold the power button a bit too long, you'll go into pairing mode. No big deal, and I'm\xa0now\xa0used to counting.The e-fence size and angle limits.  I have a steep cliff on the property and I wanted to inner fence that off, but it's apparently too small an area.\xa0 Not an issue as again my dog's been trained to stay away, and in a way, I'm glad Dogtra accepts that making too small an area for a fence could result in inconsistent direction to your dog - if you don't know GPS isn't precise down to inches.  Large areas work best to allow for a little GPS lag/slight imprecision, and at least Dogtra shows they care about dog treatment and designed the product to these limitations.I've used the collar for a while now in all sorts of wet, hot, cold conditions including some dunks in salt water when the dog took a dip and have had zero issues. Product documentation says salt water is fine, just give the device a quick freshwater\xa0rinse afterward.\xa0\xa0Dogtra's\xa0been making this type of product for a while and know what they are doing...this isn't meant to the lowest cost cheaply made collar/system. All parts are well made and ready for real wet, muddy, sandy, vegetation snaggy life.\xa0 \xa0I shopped for a collar for a while and there are more expensive products out there that promise great tracking/containment but with the Pathfinder 2, I'm not sure how those other GPS e fence collar systems will compete - Pathfinder 2 is the best in class system for less than the others.  Highly recommended."", 'Quality is good but user friendliness is terrible. This system requires a pairing process with a smart phone every time it’s turned on. I’ve had the system fail to connect defeating the purpose of the product. I set it up a home with Wi-Fi and cell service because outdoors no cell service or Wi-Fi are available. When it does connect, sometimes the collars go offline and stop communicating so I can’t see where the dogs are. The controller only has one correction button so you’re limited to correcting one dog one way unless you get your phone out and change which dog and which correction the single button will perform. It’s a hassle to carry the controller and phone around all day. They can’t be separated and you can’t use Bluetooth for anything else while they’re paired.  My old Dogtra system allowed me to correct either dog with vibration or shock, and I could choose between a nick or constant shock and the level of stimulus from the controller. I recommend trying a different system.', ""I originally bought a different collar because it was much cheaper for the initial investment,  however,  I am glad I returned it and got this pathfinder 2 instead. The upfront cost was pretty expensive but looking at the long term usage there are no monthly subscriptions or map update costs.  I have used this several times and the battery seems to last quite a while,  I would say that it absolutely lasts 8+ hours before it needs recharged.I bought this for my Husky and he is not a hunting dog but I have used this for training purposes and safety. My dog is very stubborn and tends to ignore commands if he is distracted or just doesn't feel like listening. He also had a very strong prey drive and will take off after anything that moves. This collar has been great at getting him to listen and stop chasing.  It only took about 3 socks and now he only requires a beep or vibration to get back on track.  When training I would beep,  then congrats, and if he still wouldn't listen I would shock and now he's a completely different dog.The only things I noticed, and they're not huge for me, but when he had the collar on and shakes his head the antenna whips hard and does hurt if it hits you. The other thing is that the locations aren't precise, they're about 30 feet of the location, still close enough for me to look and see him but not exact.Overall I love this collar and it has made our hiking,  fishing and camping trips so much better."", ""Several reviews spoke about the very short refund period on the E-Collar. Mine started having issues about 100 days after purchase. Dogtra would only repair the E-Collar which was stimulating the dog all the time as the remote button was malfunction. I got the unit back and the button was fixed but it would only stimulate about every third or fourth attempt. Amazon customer service gave me a partial refund (about 85%). I've talked to several dog trainers and they recommend Garmin E Collars."", 'Update: After a few days use in the yard the collar has died.  It died in the morning on a full charge.  Only option is to return and try another unit.I like the unit.  The distance to dog with the GPS appears to be off at times.  I drove to the store with the dog in the yard.  GPS said she was 724 yards away.  Point to point distance with mapping software said 1.3 miles.This charges via a USB cable so there is no need to have an inverter.My overall rating means nothing as I\'ve not taken it out of the box yet.  I noticed first thing that it charges via a USB cable.  No need to purchase an inverter if you are going to overnight in the field.  I had tried to find this information prior to purchasing and could not.  I now have a brand new invertor that I can use for....  ?I\'ll update once I\'ve used the Pathfinder 2.  I have a Great Pyrenees that I need to keep in the yard (E-fence) and manage ""off leash"" (mobile fence).', 'I bought this model because it has the efence function. First, my dog is afraid of the collar because he knows he gets zapped now. It calms him down quick. I have a mix breed with lab and hound. The only issue I have this collar is it isn’t accurate. When my dog is inside of efence the display shows he is out. The apps keep’s alert me he is outside of parameters when he wasn’t. I have to call the company about it. But the collar works well overall.', 'I’ve had the Dogtra Pathfinder 2 for about 3-4 months.What I like:No subscription feesTracks him in real time (every second)Geofence functionality (setup a fence on the tablet/phone and you’re instantly notified when your dogs leaves the boundaries) the boundaries are 100% customizable.I do like the warranty. My first one died after a month but a call to customer service and I had a new one 3-5 days later.What I don’t like:I’ve only gotten 1.5 miles range before the tracker loses my dog. So it does NOT track him 9 miles. Not sure how that’s even possible if it’s a true GPS tracker. Appears to be a hybrid model using radio frequency plus gps so you’re limited to trees, hills, buildings, etcOverall…I’d rather have paid $200 instead of $400+', 'Now I know exactly where my puppies are', 'I was cross shopping this with the Garmin which is much more expensive.  Unfortunately I think I made the wrong choice. The tracking and gps features work well but the e-collar functionality is poor especially for the price.  My older sportdog 150$ collar works much better for training.  I can tone, vibrate, and shock all without looking down and can easily adjust intensity.  With the new gps collar I have to keep the phone and remote within a few feet of each other.  You have to preselect the function on the remote.  I like to tone, then vibrate, then shock but with this one I have to have my phone in my hand and look down at it which ruins my timing. I’m disappointed', 'SAVE YOUR MONEY. Bought this for my dog to track and train in one system.This collar is never working as expected. It is either always undetectable through the app, or even when it is detected, I cannot make updates to it. For example: I have tried so many times to increase the efence level, even followed youtube step by step tutorials, and it will not update. This is not a one time thing, I repeatedly try. Another example that happens is not being able to update the function on the remote. The app just lets me click it, I click update, and nothing sticks. Again, this happens all of the time. To answer any troubleshooting quesitons, yes, the system is always up to date. The app is up to date, and I have even disconnected the receiver and the remote from each other and reconnected them. Nothing works. It should not be this hard and complicated to use.I also cannot even get on the phone with staff member at your establishment. I just tried calling and it continuously rang and rang and rang.I struggle with the website as well. On the dogtrapathfinder website ""shop now"" doesn\'t work. On the dogtra website, I tried to place an order for a new charger to have an extra one on hand, and that doesn\'t work either. It repeatedly told me that it was unable to process the payment information and I tried multiple credit cards. On top of that, I was not even sure if I was buying the correct charger, because they don\'t have the pathfinder 2 listed as a compatible device for any of the chargers offered on dogtra.comFinally, I checked my account on dogtra.com and the collar that I know I registered, is not listed under my account at all.I am so disappointed in this product and the service/resources available all around. At this point, I would greatly appreciate my money back and am not interested in a replacement. I would sell it, but don\'t feel confident in offering this to someone else.SERIOUSLY. SAVE YOUR MONEY.']"

I bought this watch November 13. It was a birthday gift to myself. I have always wanted an Apple Watch but didn’t want to pay hundreds of dollars for the watch. So naturally I went to Amazon and started looking for alternatives. After looking at product after product and reviews after reviews. I found this watch. Not going to lie the color choices are what drew me in. I absolutely love the design of this watch. It’s very comfortable and sleek looking. My household purchased 3 watches in total. A black one(my boyfriend’s pick), a pink one(my sisters pick) and a purple one for myself. I waited til I had actually tried it out for awhile before I wrote my review and the verdict is…….I actually really really like this watch. I can honestly say give it another month and I might actually love it. The watch comes with 2 size bands. So if you have freakishly small wrist like me don’t worry this watch will definitely for you! It was a little difficult to put together because I didn’t read the manual on how to put it together but honestly who reads those things!?! Apparently I do because after 10 minutes of struggling to figure it out I caved and read it. After reading how to put it together, I felt like an idiot because it was super easy. The watch comes with a QR code you can scan and it will take you directly to the app to download. I thought it would be difficult to set up but it wasn’t. The app is very easy to use and I love how anything you can do on the watch reflects in the app. I love that I can monitor my sleeping. I actually was looking forward to this feature because I’m a weirdo and wanted to know how long I actually slept for, not that I needed a watch to tell me I sleep to much, that’s what parents are for! I don’t sleep without it now. It’s become a habit to turn in the monitor sleeping and check it every morning. I can track my steps(not that I needed to know I move at the pace of a sloth), I can track my real time heart rate(which is very entertaining to watch when I’m suppose to be working), measures my blood oxygen, which I had no clue what it was until I googled it, turns out I got good blood oxygen(still don’t know what it is but mines good!) which the same can’t be said about my stress level, which in-fact this watch also tracks! This watch has a lot of features that are super great and all but there are some things I wish it had that it doesn’t. I wish I could take calls and text on it. I know it’s a watch not a phone but it would be cool to be able to do that. I do get notifications but I still wish I could make and take calls on the watch and text off it. I still love that fact that every notification I turn on comes through my watch tho. I don’t like the location of the button on the side but I can live with it. Those are my only two complaints honestly. I’m not to tech savvy so this is the perfect amount of technology I can handle! The battery actually last pretty long if you aren’t like and constantly are playing/checking every single feature every 5 minutes! I probably check my heart rate every 15 to 20 minutes. The charger is magnetic which is really cool, never seen a charger like that before. All in all it’s a really nice and affordable watch if you are looking for an alternative. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase and am very happy I bought it.', 'I was leary of buying a cheap smartwatch. However, I did not want to pay for an expensive watch. I have had this watch for several months, and I am very pleased with it. The app. is easy to use and view data. The watch has a great battery life of around two weeks or longer. I can receive texts and see who is calling via the watch. The data measure seems to be accurate and I love the stress detection feature. The only feature I am missing is the ability to measure blood pressure.', 'No era compatible del todo, pero después con otro equipo puedo visualizar los WhatsApp', ""It's a nice watch and an excellent price if you want to spend less on an Apple watch. It's great, works perfectly, and the battery life lasts a long time. I am returning, but not because it was terrible. It's because I bought myself an Apple Watch, a nice upgrade, so I don't need this watch anymore.Otherwise great watch. I love the color as well so gorgeous!"", 'Really want to love this watch, which I almost do, however….I don’t like that there’s no calendar type app that I could input appointments etc. and also the app sucks. Other than that it’s pretty decent. Also the first few days of wearing I would feel a weird tingle feeling around my wrist, it has seem to not do it has often lately though. I was hoping this would be a purchase where I wouldn’t have to upgrade, but it’s looking like that’s what I may have to do soon. ADD A CALENDAR APP & you make keep me as a loyal customer 😀', 'I had this phone for a year then the strap keeper fell off so I bought the same watch again.  This one drops the connection regularly, doesn’t recognize my device when it is 2 inches away.  I have to disconnect, search for the QR code to get a new connection which usually takes multiple efforts to recognize my watch.  Even when it is connected it is very difficult to get it to refresh and display the data.  This will not be my choice next time the strap breaks.', 'It was great the first week I had it. But now it doesn’t read properly (how could I sleep 23 hrs and walk 5k steps the same day). My BPM is always wrong. It won’t link my weather even tho it’s set up correctly on the app and my phone. The water and walk alerts stopped. It won’t stay synced to alert me of calls, messages, or anything else. I got this in Nov 2022 and by Jan 2023 it’s nothing more than a pedometer that tells me the date and time.', 'Wish I would get more notifications, was expecting to get all social media DMs and do not.', 'My steps are counted while I mow the lawn. Yeah. The watch faces are fun with many choices. The watch has great monitoring of heart rate, stress, steps, sleep. The watch is easy enough to use even  for a 70 year old. Extend battery life by removing monitoring of some functions. I monitored sleep briefly. It was interesting to see the stages of sleep. I typically do not monitor sleep as I do not like anything on my wrist when I sleep. Good deal.', 'The watch works well when near phone not so much away from phone']"

This unit tracks steps (pedometer), Heart rate tracker (BPM), blood pressure, tracks sleep patterns, Blood Oxygen (SPO2) and calories burned.  You can also read messages from social media, text, and answer and hang up your phone calls.  It appears this is via Bluetooth.It also has GPS and seven sports tracking modes to cover primary workout routines and local weather when paired with your compatible mobile phone (Android or iOS).The app Da Fit, offers access to most social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, LinkedIn) as well as allows remote control for your media player and camera on your mobile.  It also connects to local weather and displays local weather real-time.  This is nice to have when you need a quick review of weather without pulling out your phone.The watch is a touch screen which functions quite nicely, no lag time or erratic behaviours for when you need to navigate the menu quickly.Wearability:The band is sturdy and stood up to my sweatiest workouts.  I’ve had issues with bands on other smartwatches that irritated my skin after a few days, but this band does not cause irritation and is quite comfortable.  The bands that irritated me in the past would also seem to have a white caking of sweat (salts) that discolored the band requiring me to use alcohol wipes regularly to keep the band and the sensors cleaned.  Not this unit.  I’ve also worked out in the rain and have used near water with no issues.  Its sturdy and comfortable.I wish it had an option to disable the unit coming on when flicking my wrist as it can be distracting when turning over at night, however it does have a dim function (theater mode) but you have to select it at the time you want it on, then remember to disable it when you are up and ready to go.  Not a big deal, but I’ve had other units where you could set times when this is disabled and enabled each day.  I’m spoiled I guess.Accuracy:I’ve read that no smartwatch can match actual medical equipment (makes sense), however I check my blood pressure, BPM, and O2 levels daily with standalone equipment and this watch is very close to those readings each morning.  This test makes me feel more confident with readings during exercise as I must monitor my readings for my particular health issues.  I know when I need to back down or if I can push harder during workouts without concerns.Charge time:My watch charges fully in less than 3 hours from single percentage battery life to full.  Since it only needs charging roughly once a week, that makes things easy.  I like easy.Battery life:The unit claims to have a battery life of 7-10 days, however my use has seen 5-7 days which is still longer than previous smart watches I’ve owned.  I’ve noticed, the more functions I enable, the shorter my battery life.  I’ve stopped connecting to social media and text messaging which helps a great deal.Affordability:$56 is what I paid for it which is a steal compared to big name smart watches.Overall Review:I really like this unit.  While it seems primarily marketed towards women, I purchased the black one and I find its design to be unisex (either that or I’m less manly than I thought).  At any rate, the unit is sturdy, provides tangible data, and offers features that make it very user friendly.  This is important because the instructions included are 1) rather incomplete and 2) written so small I need two pairs of glasses to read.  Since the app is rather user friendly and easy to figure out maybe that’s why they didn’t spend a lot of effort on instructions.The last thing which is kind of silly but cool to me, is that along with over 100 watch face options, you can actually upload your own photo customizing your watch face.  I’ve not ever had that option with previous smart watches (okay so I really am not that manly).I’ll try beating it up some more and will update if I see any issues.UPDATE:This unit does offer a way to customize the period for the ""quick view"" (flicking the wrist to activate).  On the app, there is a Quick View section, and one of the options is Valid Period.  Once that is set to your desired time, you can sleep at night (or whenever you choose) without the watch activating from your movement.  I\'m glad I considered that a personal opinion and not a ding against the watch and app.  Thanks to my wife for finding that option.', 'Serves the purpose for a good price.', 'Holds battery for at 3 days. Comes with many features including sleep monitor, blood pressure, and many others. It has many options for changing the watch face. You can use it as a phone and music player. Lightweight design built sturdy.', 'Very disappointed in this smart watch!The BPM (heart) readings and the blood pressure readings were far off, compared to another smart watch I have and two separate blood pressure monitors.The user manual is a miniature booklet (3 1/2"" x 2"") that you need a magnifying glass to read.  There is no support or website for help that I can see although it is possible that it is listed in unreadable text in the miniature user manual somewhere.The data app (DA FIT) is awful, very poorly designed and lacks functionality of a similar app like H Band.While the watch is branded as from a company called NEKOPA, there is no mention of that name on the watch or the packaging it came in.  The box name is ""Fashion smart watch"".  The name ""Fashion"" implies to me that this was not meant to be a serious smart watch contender and the results I experience confirm that conclusion.Don\'t waste your time with this watch.', 'Only comes with 3 faces, the rest you make yourself. Battery life is good.  Time the face stays lite up is too short.  No instructions and no company support', 'This smartwatch is really nice. From the packaging to the user interface. The app is also nice. The app has several watch faces for you to download straight to your watch. Music plays from the watch, which is really nice. I’ve tried other so called smart watches and this one stands way over the others. The watch band is very comfortable and is really secure.  Highly recommend.', 'Great style, long battery life, and all the similar functions of other expensive watches on the market!']"

I thought I was doing something wrong but I wasn't the reason both would not work together is because I have two left earbuds. So yes I was doing it wrong but only because it was a poorly put together set. And now I see I took to long to figure out why because my return window closed on the 6th of September and today is the 7th so no return available for something I didn't know would be a problem. I can only hope that this review gets read by someone who understands and can make an exception for me and allows me to make a return. And this is just one of the problems I have had with this expensive watch. I meen the rest of the problems are in the watch it's with the app you use to access the watch functions like blood pressure it's always wrong,the heart rate reading is wrong everytime I check,and the sleeping data is off also I've tried to contact support but to no avail. So I hope to be lucky this time but I'm not to optimistic. Only because this would be the second watch I've received but luckily this one did have two earbuds only they both go in your left ear and that's not how it is supposed to be it's should be a left and a right. But fingers crossed. Wish me luck"", 'The watch itself is great. It’s not to big or bulky and has a good battery life. The only reason I bought the watch was for the fact it had head phone built into it, but the pocket that the headphones sit in are not sealed so any little bit of water that gets on the watch soaks the headphones and the power terminals for when they charge. This is why in the instructions they say don’t charge it while in a moist or damp area and I’m guessing that is why people are complaining about the headphones not working after a few days to a few weeks of having it. The headphones taking water damage and the mic not working on the watch are the only 2 downsides I have found so far aside from that I love the watch.', 'It is a very cool configuration, I have showed it to several people who plan to purchase it as a gift for someone else. The only problems I have had is getting the earbuds out of the watch, which may be due to the size of my fingers. The other issue is the Bluetooth doesn’t always work seated directly in front of my phone.  While sitting still they still seem to loose connection and the sound is intermittent.

‎B09V2ZMZY8,"Slothcloud Smart Watches for Men Women,Fitness Activity Tracker Watch with Heart Rate Blood Oxygen Monitoring IP68 Waterproof 1.71 inch Full Touch Screen Smart Watch Compatible for iOS Android, Black",Smartwatches,S$103.95,https://www.amazon.sg/Slothcloud-Activity-Monitoring-Waterproof-Compatible/dp/B09V2ZMZY8/ref=sr_1_290?qid=1695864528&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051%2Cp_72%3A6469119051%2Cp_36%3A10000-90000&rnid=6450031051&s=electronics&sr=1-290,https://www.amazon.sg/Slothcloud-Activity-Monitoring-Waterproof-Compatible/product-reviews/B09V2ZMZY8/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,3.9,"['Si tratta di uno smartwatch cinese di fascia media, reperibile anche sotto altri marchi.Come prodotto, poi, è a sua volta simile a tutti gli smartwatch cinesi (di forme differenti, anche non rigged) di questa fascia di prezzo:  firmware proprietario (con più o meno funzioni a seconda del tipo e del prezzo dell\'orologio), ed interfacciamento con lo smartphone tramite l\'app ""DaFit"", presente sia per iOs che per Android.Nel nostro caso, l\'app DaFit è assolutamente necessaria in quanto non è possibile (ho guardato e riguardato i menù interni più volte), regolare l\'ora senza sincronizzazione con lo smartphone.Nel caso di questo prodotto abbiamo un ""rugged smartwatch"" più che onesto. La cassa è impermeabile e resistente agli urti. Non credo si possano fare immersioni, ma per un normale bagno o per un po\' di snorkeling va più che bene. Il tutto dà una buona idea di robustezza, senza un peso poi così eccessivo.Al polso è un po\' ingombrante, ma si fa perdonare con l\'ampio display, visibile anche in condizioni di forte luce.Il software, come detto, è tipico di questi smartwatch cinesi. In questo caso la vocazione al fitness ed allo sport è più marcata rispetto ad altri prodotti simili, con la possibilità di monitorare gli esercizi di ben 24 modalità sportive (presenti addirittura \'ballo\' ed \'alpinismo\'). Sono poi presenti i consueti misuratori di battito cardiaco, ossigeno nel sangue, pressione sanguigna e qualità del sonno: l\'indicazione, comparata con quella di altri strumenti, mi pare attendibile ad eccezione della pressione sanguigna, che viene misurata con valori un po\'troppo bassi.E\' possibile comandare a distanza la fotocamera ed il lettore musicale dello spartphone, oltre che vedere le informazioni meteo. Vi sono infine le funzioni di cronometro, conto alla rovescia e tre allarmi.L\'orologio offre una copiosa quantità di menù per accedere alle varie funzioni, parzialmente sovrapponibili. Facendo swipe dall\'alto verso il basso e da sinistra verso destra appaiono due mini menù; quello più completo lo si ottiene premendo il tasto in basso a destra. Personalmente ho trovato il tutto unpo\' dispersivo, il mini menù ottenibile facendo swipe da sinistra verso destra ha poi delle icone troppo piccole ed è sostanzialmente inutile.Facendo swipe da destra verso sinistra si accede quindi direttamente ad alcune funzioni come i misuratori (battito cardiaco, pressione etc...), le modalità di monitoraggio delle attività sportive, il lettore audio ed il controllo della fotocamera. Le funzioni di cronometro e conto alla rovescia e le sveglie sono invece un po\' troppo ""nascoste"", essendo accessibili solo dal menù completo. Nulla di così scomodo comunque.Ampia la capacità di personalizzazione: l\'app DaFit offre numerosi quadranti tra cui scegliere, forse un po\' banali, ma si compensa con la quantità. Personalmente adotto quelli senza fronzoli, che facciano sì che l\'ora sia ampiamente leggibile.La connettività con lo smartphone è essenziale. Non è possibile fare/ricevere chiamate né rispondere ai messaggi dallo smartwatch. Si hanno solo le notifiche di mail, whatsapp, messaggi, telegram ed altro, cui si accede facendo swipe dal basso verso l\'alto. Stranamente, a differenza di whatsapp e degli sms, nei messaggi telegram non viene visualizzato il testo ma si ha solo la notifica. Mistero.Il software gira bene e non ha particolari lag e/o impuntamenti. Anche la sincronizzazione con lo smartphone non dà problemi (testato con iOs). Qualche piccolo appunto, invece, lo merita il sensore che attiva lo schermo al movimento del polso. In alcune situazioni, infatti, appare poco reattivo.Da ultimo il capitolo batteria. Nella pagina del prodotto vengono dichiarati 7 giorni di autonomia usandolo e 15 in standby; secondo me sono un po\' meno: con un uso medio, ho registrato un consumo di circa il 20% di batteria al giorno, che dà quindi un\'autonomia di 5 giorni circa. Risultato comunque discreto.Concludendo, non lo ritengo una patacca e 4 stelle (che approssimano, diciamo, un voto di 3,7) mi sento di darle. Penso sia indicato a chi vuole avvicinarsi al mondo degli smartwatch senza spendere tanto, oppure a chi ha già uno smartwatch di quelli validi ma vuole un muletto da portare in giro senza troppi patemi: sotto questo aspetto, il suo onesto lavoro lo fa.', 'This affordable lightweight watch is amazing for people looking for a fitness watch or just a smart looking watch, for the price of £55 it’s a good bit of kit.

It monitors heart rate and has a lot of other health and wellness features. It also displays my messages and calls.What I find to be really cool about this watch is the size. It has a substantial and extremely soft and comfortable silicone band. It’s large size is both in its width and its length. The actual watch face is really large and very masculine. It looks very similar to a very expensive diving watch. This large watch face allows for a nice easy to read display screen as well. The display screen is really easy to see due to the size as well as the graphics being crisp and clear and full of color. I also appreciate that the menu is very easy to operate. I simply can turn it on with the button on the side of the phone and see the time right away, then if I hit the button below that I can scroll through my menu options. I can use the touch feature and select which ever of the menu items I want simply by touching it with my finger. It also has a great way to charge. It charges magnetically by direct contact with usb cable. It also comes with an extra band in cammo to switch out from the standard black one.', 'Update.

I went for the stainless steel (silver) model rather than the black version, and at £139 it's a bargain. It comes with a nice leather strap and a spare flurorubber strap too and others are available at cheap prices.It has a very nice 1.43 inch Amoled screen which is smooth as you like, and is a quality build with sapphire glass, which makes it a tough watch to damage or scratch.The Mi Fitness software from Xiaomi is pretty inuitive, and pairing it to my phone was simple enough out of the box. The software requires some personalisation to get the watch working as you want, but once that's done, it's fine.I've got my watch set to switch on when I move my wrist round (rather than having it 'always on display), and have set up the main functionality widgets that are important to me for easy access (by swiping left or right on the watch face). Downloading watch faces is done through the app and there are hundreds of free options available which are easily applied and can be swapped in seconds. You can even personalise some of these with your own photographs, adding up to 8 images to your selected analogue or digital watch face.It has inbuilt GPS with way too many exercise options (117 at the last count), but I only need walking, with the odd run or hike perhaps. I can also answer calls, see the important notifications that I've asked to appear, and the battery seems to last a few days with heavy usage, or weeks just as a watch.The only downside I've found was that the latest firmware took an age to download and install on the watch via the app. I'm now running 1.4.174, and this latest firmware seems to have improved speeds and added functionality to the firmware out of the box. Mind you, some of the functionality (like using the watch to take photos on your mobile phone and playing music through the watches speaker) seem gimmicky and impractical to me, but I suppose the developers are just showing off how much their watch can do.In conclusion, I can only say that this is one of my happiest purchases in recent memory.

Dei giorni c e scritto costa 116€ con sconto 4% ultimamente dice sconto 42% ma costa sempre 116€! HahahL Orologio dopo mille prove di riavvio ecc e un aggiornamento software comunque forse è a accettabile se lo si paga attorno ai 100Ma a prezzo di listino sui 200euro temo non vale la pena prenderlo.Sarà che forse mi sembrava già scadente Apple watch e il mio ultimo è Apple watch 6 comprato appena uscito, ormai anche lui quasi vecchio 2 /3 anni.Questo per certe cose mi sa abbastanza scadente anche il batto che al posto di stop scrive baigti belgi allenamenti scrive metà straniero metà italiano..Pagamento col pos alla fine aderiscono solo due banche e io che ho le carte Mastercard ma di poste italiane non funziona . Era uno dei 2 motivi per cui lo avevo scelto...Esteticamente è carino molto leggero comodo la batteria sembra durare parecchio.  Certi parametri come ossigeno e battito cardiaco misurandoli insieme all'Apple Watch all'altro braccio danno gli stessi risultati quindi i sensori sembrano affidabili almeno del battito e dell'ossigeno. A meno che non siano scadenti anche quelli di Apple watch ma si spera di no. Usandolo insieme ad iphone oltre che al cellulare Xiaomi ho anche visto che davvero l'applicazione salute su iPhone permette di sincronizzare diversi dati da questo orologio nel loro portale cosa che di solito la Apple non consente agli altri dispositivi.Speravo che il portale salute di Apple lasciasse anche inserire l'ossigeno da questo orologio invece il dato tutto sull'ossigeno non lo vuole..ma cuore , sonno kcal ecc e passi si.Mi sta sulle scatole che però nell'applicazione salute del cellulare Xiaomi se ad esempio inserisci a mano che sei stato in piedi in un certo orario non si sincronizza anche sull'orologio non capisco come mai questa cosa...Mentre ovviamente se cammini un minuto nell'arco di un'ora nell'orologio risulta che sei stato un minuto in piedi poi la stessa cosa arriva anche all' app sul cellulare.Quindi per la sincronizzazione automatica fra orologio e Cell ci siamoInvece per sincronizzarsi dall'applicazione al telefono Non lo so come mai se va cambiato qualche parametro però non lo fa se appunto metti che sei in piedi sul telefono non arriva anche all'orologio.. Non ho guardato bene ma la stessa cosa mi sembra succede anche per gli altri dati le calorie e i passi tutto quanto quindi anche questa cosa mi sembra una strana mancanza che sincronizzando l'orologio Xiaomi non si sincronizza bene con l'applicazione Xiaomi sul cellulare Xiaomi.Mentre per assurdo provando a sincronizzarlo dall'iPhone sempre scaricando l'applicazione Xiaomi mi fit su iPhone ,In iPhone l app mi fit mo dà più parametri opzioni che invece non mi mostra la stessa applicazione mi sul Cell mi quindi anche sta cosa molto strana e deludente..A parte questi piccoli dettagli se lo trovate intorno ai €100 e avete solo quel budget comunque mi sembra accettabile alla fine fa quasi tutto quello che fanno anche gli SmartWatch da €800. Poi Amazon dà anche la possibilità di aggiungere con meno di €10 la garanzia danni accidentali e quindi se lo rompete per colpa vostra entro tre anni almeno in teoria dovrebbero riderne un altro identico...Sicuramente per lo meno è perfetto come secondo orologio e per le occasioni più a rischio magari se andate in discoteca a un concerto oppure per entrarci in mare senza la paura di romperlo eccetera.."", ""allora dopo averlo testato un paio di settimane posso raccontare la mia esperienza .(prima di tutto ho fatto un reso del primo perché aveva problemi con i widget ) il secondo mandatomi con operatore Amazon TOP. ..FUNZIONA bene .

Ora che è sceso sotto i 90€ ho deciso di fare un upgrade rispetto al mio vecchio GTR47.Le killer feature che cercavo in un nuovo smartwatch erano, in ordine di priorità:- possibilità di effettuare pagamenti contacless direttamente dall\'orologio- ricevere chiamate e poter rispondere direttamente sull\'orologio con una qualità audio sufficientemente buona- possibilità di avviare uno scatto da remoto della fotocamera del telefono cellulareS1 active ha tutte queste funzioni, che non mi fanno rimpiangere il passaggio da GTR47.L\'unica cosa a cui ho dovuto rinunciare è qualche giorno di autonomia in più.Con AOD sempre acceso, tranne nell\'intervallo 11PM-7AM, la batteria non arriva a 3 giorni di autonomia.Senza AOD siamo intorno ai 5-7 giorni, dipende dal numero di notifiche, attività e altri fattori che influenzano la durata della batteria. Col GTR47 vecchio di due anni arrivavo oltre i 10 giorni.Ingombrante e poco pratica la basetta di ricarica, avrei preferito una soluzione più slim [tipo appunto quella del GTR47 o successivi].Questione pagamenti con NFC: è supportato solo il circuito mastercard, quindi eventuali carte come postepay o simili che usano VISA, non è possibile aggiungerle all\'interno del wallet Xiaomi Pay.Il workaround a questa limitazione si può trovare in Curve. Si tratta in buona sostanza di un ""aggregatore"" di carte di pagamento, che in forma del tutto gratuita ti consente di avere una carta fisica, su circuito mastercard, con la quale effettuare pagamenti reindirizzati automaticamente ad altre carte [anche con altri circuiti]. Basta aggiungere la carta Curve al wallet Xiaomi Pay, e dall\'app di Curve aggiungere la propria postepay o qualsiasi altra carta non supportata nativamente dallo smartwatch.Zero costi di transazione, zero costi di attivazione, tutto gratuito e tutto funzionante.Lato fitness l\'ho usato poco. Il fix del GPS non è immediato, ma comunque 20/30 secondi mi sembrano decenti come velocità.La misurazione dell\'ossigeno nel sangue va fatta stando perfettamente immobili per una trentina di secondi, altrimenti la misurazione fallisce.Simpatica la notifica di rilevazione attività [""sembra che tu stia camminando, vuoi avviare la sessione camminata?""], e anche il monitoraggio del sonno, comprensiva della rilevazione automatica del ""power nap"" pomeridiano, è sufficientemente accurata.Per 90€ non ho trovato una soluzione più economica per effettuare pagamenti contactless. Sicuramente un ottimo compromesso tra tecnologia, qualità costruttiva, software e portafogli.Peccato non esista un modo per personalizzare le watchfaces o scaricarle da un repository esterno. Quelle sull\'app xiaomi sono molte, ma non c\'è paragone rispetto alla pletora disponibile per i modelli amazfit su portali terzi [per non parlare della possibilità di disegnarle da soli tramite software sviluppati da utenti entusiasti].Questo, insieme alla durata della batteria non entusiasmante e alla basetta di ricarica ingombrante, mi fanno togliere la quinta stella.Ma è comunque uno smartwatch che mi sento di consigliare se preso a un prezzo inferiore a 90€.', ""Il prodotto è arrivato molto prima del previsto, rispetto a quanto Amazon dichiarava in fase di acquisto.La confezione è molto elegante, a livello di prodotti molto più costosi.Nella scatola si hanno caricabatteria magnetico e libretto di istruzioni, oltre l'orologio.Il corpo è interamente in policarbonato, come da descrizione, ed è leggerissimo, indicato per chi deve svolgere attività sportiva. Possiedo una Mi Band e devo dire che la differenza al polso, in peso, è davvero minima, eppure il quadrante da 46mm fa pensare ad un ingombro ben superiore.Le attività agonistiche che si possono monitorare sono molteplici, e la connessione al cellulare avviene tramite app dedicata (Mi fitness, un vero peccato che non esista una'app unica che comprenda tutti i wearable di casa Xiaomi, per non perdere i dati precedenti se come me si proviene da altri prodotti di fasce più basse, ma questa è un altra storia).Lo schermo è molto luminoso, sotto al sole non si fa fatica a distinguerlo. I quadranti si possono selezionare fra una piccola scelta direttamente su device oppure tramite applicazione, ma non ho trovato come inserirne di personalizzati (probabilmente non si puo', ma non è un gran problema).La funzione di accensione dello schermo quando si solleva il polso prende anche altri movimenti, non solo quello classico di rotazione, ma è solo una sbavatura su una prestazione quantomeno ottima del prodotto in generale.Le chiamate vengono gestite molto bene, la vibrazione è potente e si puo' rispondere direttamente dall'orologio che è fornito di speaker, ovviamente i volumi non sono potentissimi ma sono riuscito a intrattenere intere conversazioni tramite il device senza grandi problemi di sorta.Possiede due tasti laterali, con entrambi si accende lo schermo, al primo tocco, al secondo con il superiore si entra nel menù interno (come l'app drawer di un dispositivo Xiaomi qualunque) e con l'altro, inferiore, si entra nel menù delle attività sportive in maniera diretta.Il vetro di cui è composto lo schermo sembra essere molto resistente, finora non gli ho fatto prendere molti urti o graffi quindi la resistenza agli stessi non è stata testata a dovere. Il touch è preciso e reattivo, non lascia a desiderare e non fa rimpiangere l'utilizzo di uno smartphone o di un device di fascia superiore.Il cinturino è di silicone, paragonabile a quelli dei Casio G-Shock di una volta, offre un po' di resistenza alla chiusura visto che silicone su silicone non scivola molto bene, ma una volta al polso non da fastidio e non si muove.I sensori di battito e movimento, come quello giroscopico sono abbastanza precisi, l'ho calibrato portando al polso il mio Mi Band 5 e le differenze sono davvero minime.Un prodotto che preso alla cifra di 85€ non ha nulla a che invidiare a marche molto più blasonate. Per il momento (lo porto al polso da un mesetto) promosso a pieni voti."", 'Die Uhr ist gut Musik kann man direkt rauf spielen. Sie ist schnell. Was ich aber bemängeln kann ist das man nicht raus wählen kann nur annehmen, bei günstigeren Smartwatch geht es. Halten aber meist nicht so lange dafür. Leider.

Würde ich noch ein mal kaufen. Bis jetzt', ""Piacevolmente sorpreso dalla diffusa fluidità e completezza . Luminoso, preciso per lo sport con tutta la telemetria con un tasto personalizzabile per iniziare lo sport preferito. Finalmente un orologio che mi avverte quando si disconnette il bluetooth(telefono dimenticato o lasciato distante), consuma normalmente un 15% di batteria al giorno con AOD acceso, 10%  in più ogni ora se si fa una sezione sportiva con gps e dati sempre visibili sul grande display. Se si tiene tutto operativo con una sessione sportiva di un paio d'ore, in 3-4GG necessità la ricarica, viceversa anche una 10ina di gg. Comoda la funzione di rispondere e parlare dall'orologio, non c'è una tastiera x comporre il numero, peccato. Pessima MI Fitness che consuma troppa batteria, speriamo in un aggiornamento migliorativo,ZeppLife era meno esigente. Sarebbe comodissimo e utile avere un misuratore di velocità km/ e miglia visto che c'è il gps, sarebbe una chicca in più da aggiungere all' altimetro e barometro incorporato.Il vetro in plastica è protetto dalla cassa tramite un bordino superiore, ma io ho preferito mettere un vetro salva schermo, tanto costano una stupidaggine.Il nuovo aggiornamento permette di salvare gli mp3(2Gb) nell'orologio,e collegandolo in bluetooth all'auto o cuffiette di sentire musica senza avere il cel vicino o acceso (aereo, nave, treno😅). Può comandare anche la radio ma qui serve il cel attivo.Al momento posso dire che vale più dei soldi spesi e di essere piacevolmente soddisfatto, come detto, se avesse un tachimetro(l'orologio lo permette) sarebbe 6 stelle"", 'Tut, was es tun soll.

La ricarica completa impiega un\'oretta. Speravo in una durata migliore ma sono comunque molto soddisfatto, da prendere al volo quando va in offerta sotto i 100€ (succede spesso).

Well that software is done so poorly that it insists on updating and then crashes out completely, uninstalling itself fully! So now I have a still perfectly working health band but non-existant software for it, so finding myself looking for another health band, very reluctantly.Looked around, seems like all reputable companies in this industry have moved on to watches, not bands anymore. I don't want a watch, just need all kinds of sensors and trackers for exercise and sleep, and an app where all the magic can happen. The redmi smart band pro sportswatch is the most reasonably priced device from a 'standard' maker so I got this.Works well, syncs with redmi's better written software and gets all kinds of data. One feature it doesn't seem to have which I really value is to be able to set markers for the watch to buzz on your arm when you reach certain milestones in your workout - like buzz at every km completed when jogging for example. Maybe its there and I just haven't found it or they need to put it in. It was the most useful feature of the huawei band.Anyway, at Rs.2k, this watch is super-value and great for exercise and sleep tracking. Its probably also fine for wearing like a watch, but I don't use it like that.""]"

I don't have all of the bells and whistles connected to my phone so it isn't running all day long to where it would wear the battery down. At first the battery would last 3 to 4 days. And again, now I have to charge it every night."", 'Finally, I can check time and notifications without having my phone in my pocket!! Or rather, lack of pockets, because girl pants are like this. #1 reason I wanted a smart watch.I bought this over other brands because it has a long battery life and I can customize the watch face! As an artist, I\'m excited to be able to fully customize the face of my watch.Step counter also counts how much I talk with my hands. Im a sales person, working 11 hours a day, so honestly I move my hands just as much as my feet. But I guess that still counts toward energy burning? HahaI have not yet tried the sports modes (I\'ve been at work) but I""m excited to see how those will be!The downside is that I was built with unusually small hands and wrist. This thing would look better on most other people, as even most bracelets that aren\'t adjustable wont fit me. The bottom isn\'t entirely flat (mind this if you\'re looking for a more flush watch fit, this ain\'t that!) so it sticks up, making it look weird on my stick arms. I added a photo to try and show for that. But even without that, its mostly that my wrist is just too dang small so not faulting the watch itself lolAlso, the bands are super easy to change out and with the design of the pins, I may also get a bit crafty in making my own bands.The only real issue I have so far is probably user error. I cannot figure out how to make the screen not turn on when I move my arm, so when I move at night it blinds me like the sun! Sleep tracker seems to work pretty well aside from that.All in all:Is it accurate? Eh, not really.Is it comfortable? Sort ofIs it useful? For me, yes!Is it worth the price? Yup! I wouldn\'t expect the same accuracy of a $300+ watch to match a $50 watch. So taking that into consideration, if you\'re looking for something affordable (and wrists are bigger than mine) then I would recommend this. Unless you really weigh heavily on counting your steps exactly to the digit.', 'This watch looked good and lasted almost a year before the Bluetooth failed to connect. Fortunately, I bought the extended warranty and they are sending me an Amazon gift card to replace it. Since I liked it so much, I am purchasing another one—with the extended warranty, of course.', 'I have several complaints about this watch.I\'ve had three Fitbit Charges. They all had my heart rate MUCH higher than this watch. At doctor visits, my heart rate matched what the Fitbit read. This watch says my heart rate is 30-40 beats per minute slower than actual.This watch\'s step count was far less than actual, again compared with a walk taken many times with my Fitbit.The sleep tracker had it so I never had any awake time throughout the night, every night. Everyone turns over and has at least moments of being awake. My typical awake time was 35-60 minutes with all of my Fitbits. This watch always has none.It\'s awesome that this watch has a speaker! Unfortunately, it isn\'t loud enough for me to hear anything unless I\'m standing still so there\'s no background noise from my movements and I have it close to my head. It\'s better than nothing though!I have to charge it every two to three days.There aren\'t enough capabilities to turn on/off app notifications. Almost every notification gets grouped into the ""other"" category. I wish they would at least have some emails listed. It\'s either, get notified for everything, or hardly anything at all.Speaking of notifications, it only lists maybe five notifications. Then, you only have the option of clearing all notifications. You cannot just swipe one away or anything like that.The blood pressure sensor and blood oxygen levels seem to work well though!I wanted a watch that could do everything. This has pretty much everything I could think of! Unfortunately, it doesn\'t do much very well. I probably should\'ve just gotten another Fitbit.', ""I got this instead of a Life Alert because of the features and style.  Really like it, except I don't know how accurate all the parameters are, i.e., blood pressure, pulse, sleep time.  Does need to be charged quite often. Usually do it at night so I can have the phone feature on during the day in case I don't have my phone handy.  Great delivery."", ""I Iost my Fitbit Versa 2 that I've worn for many years. I bought beautiful bands for it, never had a problem and only removed it to shower. After coming in from doing yardwork, it was gone and I immediately got on Amazon to replace it because I couldn't be without a smartwatch. I actually like this watch very much, but I don't think that I can keep it. I'm very afraid of losing it too because I can't adjust the bands to fit my small wrist. I'm sad and surprised that  it's made for someone much larger because I have bought many after market decorative bands. I usually need to be at the smallest possible fastener but that's fine.  I can't get either band tight enough to secure the watch near my wrist. I have ordered another band, but it was rather expensive so am not certain that I will keep this watch. Too bad, It is well worth the money, and does many things, but it doesn't matter what it does, if I can't keep it on my wrist. I have pushed it way up my arm as I decide what to do, and I think that the position I must wear it, is affecting the accuracy of the heart rate and other health functions. I may chat with the customer service person and see if they have options available for me. I wish I could wear this great watch properly and securely."", 'I really like this watch, especially the sound, vibration, and detailed notifications for texts, emails and calls.  When I’m at work I sometimes miss calls and texts from my kids. This watch will help me to stay on top of important messages and allow me to respond promptly.The watch comes with a very attractive, rose gold watch band along with an extra stylish, light pink  strap. I thought this was a nice bonus. The watch became easy for me to put on (myself) after the second or third try - the strap is expandable to fit smaller or larger wrists.The display can be changed to any of the very nice, multiple styles available or you can use your own custom photos. The watch face stays dark until there is movement (like when you lift your wrist to see the watch).  This is fine with me, feature probably helps preserve battery life.You can make adjustments to notifications with the downloadable “da fit” app. I have an iPhone 14 pro and had no problems with compatibility, the watch worked perfectly. If you have questions about pairing the watch to your phone or how to use features, the instructions booklet is helpful and easy to understand.You can track your sleep schedule if you want, but I take my watch off at night to charge. The watch charger is very easy to use. Battery life is long lasting, perfect for my needs.I would recommend buying this watch, this is a great smart watch. I don’t need an expensive competitor watch for my needs.', ""Just as described and fits nicely. I wish you could change the bands, hence only 4 stars.  But an overall great buy. You can't tell the difference btw an apple watch and this one really.  I like it.""]"

Obviously time for a new watch, Went through Amazon  listings and found this one which had a long battery life.  Also because  I volunteer on the local rescue squad, I I noticed it would provide my own vitals, Heart rate, Blood pressure, and oxygen level  which I thought was  a great feature.  Being able to make and receive phone calls obviously added to my decision.  Ordered it, and couldn't be happier.  The battery life is definitely long, and do enjoy checking my vitals.

Se conecta mediante una aplicación (gratis) con tu Celular en donde aloja más estadísticas y también ofrece opciones adicionales. Es padre, pero se requiere conexión de internet para que ambos aparatos se conectan y para que se guardan los datos del reloj dentro de la aplicación. La pantalla es de dos colores, lo que hace un poco aburrido está viendo o utilizar lo por mucho tiempo y así ver algunos usos del GPS demasiado sencillo o simple.Estética de este reloj:Se ver padre y choncho y llama la atención lo que considero bueno y malo. Es cómodo en el uso durante el día, pero puede ser un poco incomodo si lo utilizas durante la noche para dormir, yo si lo cargo lo mas que puedo porque nada mas así me aloja data completa de mi cuerpo, salud y de mis actividades. Los botones de los lados acomodan fácil suciedad por el tipo de superficie que tiene, pero aparte de este es fácil para limpiar o lavar y lo bueno es que es agua resistente he incluso para deportes acuáticos.Carga solar y carga normal:Yo vivo en un clima semi desértico con más de 300 días de sol (fuerte), si estoy a dentro de un lugar con luz solar, pero sin sol directo, no marca casi nada de actividad o carga. Si me salgo caminar en el sol directo, y giro el reloj hacia sol, entonces si marca actividad de carga solar pero no hace mucha diferencia o es comparativo con cargar lo con un enchufe, además es medio incomodo esta siempre caminando en el sol directo y tampoco me gusta cada rato quitar me el reloj para poner lo en un lugar donde hay sol directo.Retención de Carga:Yo compre este modelo en específico porque mencionaba larga utilidad de batería y además se carga según con luz solar, hasta ahora ambas no me han servido mucho y he tenido cargar lo diariamente mediante el enchufe con electricidad. En cuando pongo las aplicaciones activas como los del GPS junto con otros, aun con carga completa me dice que la pila va a durar 22 horas o menos y ya no días. El único modo que la pila dura muchos días, es cuando apago todo y lo pongo en modo descansar o apagado. Yo compre este reloj para utilizar las aplicaciones y pues decepciona un poco de saber que no se pueden tener prendidos constante o siempre sin tener cargar lo cada rato. Este detalle seria fatal en la vida silvestre y haría todos los aplicaciones inútil.Las aplicaciones del reloj:Algunos son muy padres y como los del clima y otros vienen bien detallados y con mucha información y data real, y también puedes instalar algunos adicionales que están en la aplicación que se pone al celular para vincular el reloj. Muchos de las aplicaciones ya también tienen un celular y probable son más fácil y atractivos de ver los ahíUtilidad y uso del Reloj:Yo compre este modelo, porque me gusta el senderismo y el camping y en tiempo de lluvia voy a los montañas y bosque para buscar hongos comestibles, ya me he perdido y se siente horrible y trato de estar mejor preparado para prevenir. Este reloj me puede marcar y guardara caminatas que hice y dirigir me de regreso si me pierdo y además me indica el clima y otros detalles que se requieren para el senderismo o caminatas. Pero este reloj tiene aplicaciones para todo el tipo de deportes y puede ser útil para el quien vea valor en su uso o utilidad.El instructivo para el reloj y dificultad de uso:El instructivo es muy básico y sencillo ya nada mas te dice los funciones de cada botón y lo más necesario para usar lo pero para poder operar lo al cien por ciento, se requiere experimentar o buscar en la web para poder sacar el mejor provecho y aprender todo sus funciones y opciones para cada aplicación, y con tantas funciones que tiene este modelo, si se tarda uno en aprender todo y también para acostumbrar y tener lo en mente en cuanto se puede ser útil. Hay algunos videos instructivos dentro de la pagina del sitio Garmin que ayudan un poco configuar lo.Lo que definitivamente no me gusto de este reloj es que las graficas de rutas son puras linias negras, no es ver como mapas en otros sitios o como lo tienen los modelos mas caros de Garmin donde parece la mapa visualmente mucho mas agractivo y aparte en colores. Tambien que no meguto, es que todo el tiempo uno tiene que conectar constante el reloj con la app del celular, para que se refrescan los datos del reloj, como el clima por ejemplo, osea sin celular, la aplicacion que se tienen que instalar y internet aparte, no van a funcionar todo los aplicaciones dentro del reloj, en este caso tambien las puedo ver en el celular lo que no se me hace mucho sentido, estuviera padre si podria adquirir data del GPS pero no es asi. Al reloj tanpoco no se puede instalar un propio sim card, y casi todo la data depende de la informacion en cuando se vincula con el celular lo que aveces frusta', 'Super light weight all day wear! Can’t really notice it through the day. The fenix models are heavy and uncomfortable compared to this one. If you can live without a color screen and fancy watch faces, yes you can. LCD screen is super readable and you can choose reverse dark or light faces. Fitness options are insane, unless you’re a tri athlete. Most use is constant heart rate feature  along with daily goals and stress tracking. GPS works effortlessly when needed.Synced to iPhone no problem, default watch setting are pretty solid. No touchscreen, which is actually nice for some.Garmin connect app is far superior to other fitness apps.Remember your phone that is always with you has a nice color screen with maps and apps and games😅 Maps apps and games mostly suck on watches and are novelties at best. Except the gps fitness tracking, which…. You look at on your phone after it syncs anyway.Does have basic mapping and track back mapping. Battery life is crazy long, one main reason I wanted this. Solar appears to help keep battery going.  Been wearing for almost a month and charged 2x but it’s never been  below 70% even after a week or more. Charges full in less than an hour.Cons: can’t separate sleep and do not disturb mode. If you set sleep from 10a-7a, that’s your option for timed Do not disturb.LCD screen is square but Garmin trims the corners for the solar panel overlay. Some text ends up in corner and partially obscured.If you’re thinking Casio, they don’t have anything that compares to this. They have a single function heart monitor for the same price which has static lcd display and no where near the other functionally at this price. Smaller get the S, bigger get the X.

This time around I wanted something with better battery life, and so I went for the Instinct 2 solar.Overall pretty happy with the watch, however this is mainly down to the new software features such as the body battery, health snapshots etc. It weighs next to nothing compared to my old Fenix 5, and seems very well put togther like most Garmin products.Slight dissapointment over battery life, as it seems to only last me 15-16 days before I need to charge it up (from a full charge showing 28 days.) I am off out running 4 times a week however with GPS tracking enabled, and this summer has hardly been what you'd call sunny, and so the solar charging hasn't really had a chance to work yet.My main gripe is to do with the screen size. Because there are solar panels around the circumference of the screen, the viewable data area is squeezed into a smallish square in the middle (tried to show this in the attached photo.) This can make reading some of the info on the screen very hard to do when running, especially if you have 4 or 5 data fields on show. I quickly reduced my data fields to 3 per screen, but even then it can be difficult.If I had my time again I think I would have gone for the bigger Instinct 2X just for the bigger screen, or maybe just saved up more and bought a Fenix 7 or a Epix 2. I bought the Instinct 2 Solar during Prime week, and also had a £20.00 voucher, so the watch only cost me £225.00, a lot less than a Fenix 7 or an Epix 2!"", 'Just upgraded to an Instinct 2 after my 7 year old Forerunner 235 finally gave up. I was previously exclusively a runner but wanted something with more multi-activity options.Positives:- LOADS of activity recording options (20+) which you can select to add to the watch from the app.- LOADS more data available that the Forerunner 235, particularly background data throughout the day, but also lots more performance tracking data.- Easy setup and fast syncing with the app.- Basic controls pretty simply to master.- LONG battery life which is great for longer endurance events.- Tough construction.Negative:- Screen slightly smaller than the Forerunner, although the watch looks less comically large if you’re wearing it through the day.- Because there are some many activity recording options some take a while to master. I did a weight session and it was a bit fiddly to log individual sets (which it does), but this is far superior to the ‘run/ bike/ other’ option previously.', 'Vengo da Apple e volevo qualcosa che fosse diverso, un po’ vintage e un po’ sportivo, con schermo senza led e avesse aspetto robusto.Questo Garmin mi ha convinto, ha tanti sensori e tiene sotto controllo i vari parametri corporei: FC, saturazione, riposo e stress, per non parlare del GPS che per ora si è mostrato molto preciso ed intuitivo.LaVersione 2S poi, con quadrante da 40 mm, risulta meno impattante sul polso e sembra avere migliore vestibikita sul polso sottile rispetto al 45 mm.Per ora mi trovo molto bene, unico neo laBatteria che, nonostante l’opzione solar che permette una ricarica, non supera comuqnue i 15 giorni di utilizzo in modalità smartwatch (non l’ho mai provato in modalità solo orologio, d’altronde avendolo perso per monitorare il mio stato di fitness e saluta non la userei comuqnue) per ora 4,6 stelle su 5.', 'Bought for 200 euros and im really happy with the watch aswell as garmin connect app so far.

I sold the fenix and got the instinct 2 its battery life is way longer and it does what I need, tracks routes via gps it has glonass and galileo.  There is no mapping on it but I can use my phone for that which I only need ocassionally.I also dont need garmin pay, its clunky  requiring pin numbers etc.  I can use my phone anyway so no biggie.Its light and easy to wear with gshock type styling.', ""The watch does more things than I could have hoped for. The only problems I have is it is back and white (or grey and white) The writing is a little small and hard to see.

Arrivato con un giorno d’anticipo, integro e completo di tutto (cinturini, pad per la ricarica, manuali). Il prodotto non presenta graffi. Dopo un mese di dati ed utilizzo, si è “assestato” così seguente: schermo non always on durante il training, allenamenti tempo totale ~8 ore, con prevalentemente lavoro indoor ed un paio di ore di camminata con gps ad 1 sec. Rilevazione HR per 10 ore ( prima di dormire e riposo) + 2 di allenamento al giorno, quindi indicativamente 12h al giorno. Pairing con polar flow due volte al giorno (mattina e sera). Nessuna notifica cellulare nè meteo on. Durata batteria 4 giorni esatti. Devo dire, che per il prezzo pagato, 95€, il prodotto mi soddisfa pienamente, risultando comodo da portare anche di notte ed accurato nelle misurazioni ( ovviamente considerando un margine di errore ma, ehy, stiamo pur sempre parlando di un prodotto che da una stima di tutto il processo fit&wellness, non di macchine medicali da visita medico-sportiva). A prezzo pieno forse un po’ troppo caro. Rimane comunque un ottimo affare per il momento', ""I love the look of this watch and its many options. Comfortable to wear and nice features.Only (BIG) downside: I use it for horsetraining and that seems to interfere with my steps. Even though I select horsetraining as my workout, the watch counts and adds these steps as my own. My burned calories are counted with these steps, therefore it must be off too.I bought this watch to track my calories and my own steps, seperate from my daily horse training. I must say, I am a bit disappointed to see that this doesn't seem to work.Very happy with the accuracy of the activity and statistics during horsetraining out in the hills. Even when there's no service, the watch measures everything perfectly. Ideal to keep track of all the endurance horses' trainings, and log their performances."", 'Decepción total. El reloj es precioso, pero aún n han pasado dos años desde que lo compré y la batería ya n le dura ni tres horas. Nunca lo he mojado ni sumergido, no ha estado vinculado a las notificaciones del tfno por cuestiones de trabajo, por lo que la batería no ha sufrido ese desgaste. Un precio muy elevado  (ahora está más barrato) para el poco tiempo óptimo que ha dado', 'Estoy super contenta con mi pulsómetro Polar ignite 2, mis entrenamientos son mucho mas fáciles por que a través de la app polar Flow puedes planificar tus entrenamientos para la semana, mes o incluso año. al salir a entrenar el pulsómetro te va diciendo lo que tienes que hacer, hace valoración del sueño, te mide la frecuencia cardiaca constantemente con bastante exactitud, al igual que la señal GPS también es muy buena.Tiene función de relajación, te dice la temperatura por horas, la acumulación de horas de entreno que llevas en la semana. Dispone de cronometro, fitness test y muchas cosas mas que me han encantado a la vez que ayudado en mis entrenamientos.Después si nos vamos al diseño es un reloj muy elegante y cómodo. su correa es de goma beige y la pantalla viene decorada por un anillo dorado.La pantalla es táctil y también tiene un botón en el lado izquierdo que sirve para ir atrás.En conclusión, no lo cambio por ningún otro, en todo caso por uno superior como seria el ignite 3.', 'Nachdem meine geliebte Polar Ignite nach drei Jahren den Geist aufgegeben hat (eigentlich war nur der Akku hin) dachte ich, ich leiste mir den Nachfolger. Die Uhr war sehr schnell eingerichtet, Funktionen im Großen und Ganzen wie beim Vorgänger. Optisch gefällt sie mir auch sehr gut. Anfangs war ich sehr zufrieden, außer dass der Touchscreen sehr viel träger war als ich es von vorher gewohnt war. Seit heute reagiert der Touchscreen aber gar nicht mehr. Ich kann weder das Ziffernblatt ändern, noch ein Training wählen oder starten. Es reagiert einfach gar nicht mehr. Ich habe die Uhr ausgeschaltet, neu gestartet, auf Werkseinstellungen zurückgesetzt... Nichts. Darauf habe ich keine Lust, hatte beim Vorgänger schon das Problem, dass ich zum Schluss jeden Tag zurücksetzen musste, da der Akku nicht mehr geladen, bzw das Ladegerät nicht mehr erkannt hat. Das brauche ich nicht nochmal, zumal die Uhr gerade mal 6 Wochen alt ist und angeschafft wurde, da die alte nicht mehr einwandfrei funktioniert hat. Bei einer neuen Uhr in dieser Preiskategorie erwarte ich, dass alles funktioniert, ohne dass ich ständig googeln muss, um Fehler in den Griff zu bekommen. Sehr schade, war immer von Polar überzeugt, bis heute....', 'Just got this two days ago. I am fairly happy with the watch, however it did say on the box that if I opened it I could not return it. Not sure I like that! Hopefully no problems arise!', 'Habe diese Uhr nun einige Zeit in gebrauch und sie läuft optimal. Sie misst sowohl Distanz, als auch Schlaf oder Puls sehr zuverlässig und was mich am meisten begeistert ist die Verbindung zum Handy. Der Kontakt ist dauerhaft da und man muss vor einem Training nicht ewig warten bis die Verbindung steht und man starten kann.', 'Ich nutze die Uhr seit ca. anderthalb Monaten. Optisch ein wirklicher Hingucker und der Tragekomfort ist auch sehr angenehm.Ein wirkliches Manko ist in meinen Augen der Akku. Teilweise verbraucht der Akku nachts bis zu 10 Prozent des Akkus. Nach mehreren Wanderungen kann ich sagen, dass der Akku nicht sehr lange hält und bei einer 12 bis 18km Wanderung bei GPS 1x pro Sek die Uhr noch am gleichen Tag wieder geladen werden muss. Ist man länger unterwegs, weil man viele Pausen macht oder sehr gemütlich ist, kann es sein, dass der Akku schlapp macht. Dazu kommt, dass die Uhr teilweise sehr sehr lang braucht um GPS zu finden, es teilweise sogar gar nicht funktioniert. Bei der Wanderfunktion werden gelegentlich nicht mal die Durchschnittszeiten während des Programms angezeigt.Leider kann die Polaruhr auch nur mit ihrem eigenen Ladekabel geladen werden, sodass man immer darauf achten muss, dieses auch auf jeden Fall einzupacken und dabeizuhaben.Sehr nervig und unbefriedigend, weil man dieses Kabel auch nicht einfach im Geschäft nachkaufen kann (ich habe es in mehreren Sport- und Elektroläden versucht und musste letzten Endes ein Ersatz für 18 Euro bei Amazon nachbestellen).Fazit: Eine optisch schöne Uhr mit gutem Tragekomfort uns für einige Kurse im Fitnessstudio oder für Workouts gut geeignet. Für Outdoorsportarten, bei denen man länger unterwegs ist würde ich diese Uhr nicht empfehlen.', 'Mir gefällt die Uhr von der Optik her und die App finde ich gut.']"

Here\'s why you will never buy a $300, or perhaps even a $150, smart watch again!TOUCH SCREENThe screen itself has the look of a $300+ smart watch. It\'s crisp, clear, and gives the impression that a lot of care and precision went into it\'s detail as far as pixelation to size ratio, etc.INTERFACEIt\'s smooth, clear, intuitive, and the attention to detail is breathtaking. It\'s super straight forward. And I love LOVE the two side buttons on this watch. The top button takes you certain places on the Venus, and the bottom button takes you other places... Very cool.RESPONSIVITY I am a person who is constantly moving in hyperdrive mode, so nothing is more irritating or vexing than touching a ""smart device"" that doesn\'t respond to my speed. The Venus IS MY SPEED. It moves without lag or hiccup to each flick of my finger across the screen (up, down, left and right), and rarely do I have to tap an option more than once to get it to open and so forth.ACCURACYSleep is pretty damn spot on (at worst, I\'ve noticed a 15 or 20 minute difference in my waking times),Heart rate seems accurate enough (although I have nothing outside of myself to gauge other than MY FEELING that it\'s accurate, it runs similar to an older, much more expensive smart watch I had in the past who\'s recordings mirror these).Steps are/were so grossly inaccurate. The rep I have been speaking with for the past week gave me many different tactics and options to correct the error...  If that doesn\'t work, they will be issuing me a FREE replacement, so we will see!Blood Oxygen/Calories burned, I wouldn\'t know if the 1st one is accurate, and to be honest I\'m not interested in it (sorry), but the calories are definitely accurate, especially given my general activity this Venus has recorded on my behalf, and especially when tied to my height and weight as I set into the Touchelex app under my personal settings.OPTIONS/FEATURES ON WATCHOh my goodness. What CAN\'T you do on this thing? I will offer my personal favorites:1. Screen timeout - up to 20 seconds baby!2. Timer - WHAT?? Yep. This has been a Godsend! It has preset timers for 5, 10, 30 minutes and so on, but then you can also create your own!3. Call notifications WITH 5 PREDETERMINED options/messages - that you can rewrite any time - to send the caller in case you cannot answer! **No, you cannot talk on this watch, but be honest, who wants to do that? Why be that obnoxious person having your phone conversations outloud in front of everyone in the first place? People don\'t care who you talk to, or how you talk...4. Music control5. Alarms6. Flashlight! Yes your watch can act like a flashlight7. Find your phone8. Vibration intensity - holy crap this function I have on high as well, and it wakes me up better in the morning than my vocal alarms!Oh my Hell on high water, I\'m leaving out the other 85 options.. there are so many!BATTERY LIFE/CHARGING TIMEWhen I received it last Friday, it was at 100%. I finally charged it last night (Thursday night) because it was at 30% - BUT: I have the raise to wake option running from 7 am to 1145 pm, screen timeout set to the max 20 seconds.. I\'m constantly looking at it.. It\'s astounding. Oh, and it took less than an hour and a half to charge back to 100.THE APP ITSELFIt\'s simple, but intricate. There are 4 tabs, each obviously with different purposes. The 1st tab is the readings/trackers/counters screen and offers basic views of: Steps, Sleep, Heart Rate, Workout, Blood Oxygen, and Calories. There\'s a section for choosing different WATCH FACES, alarms (I have 9 alarms set, and I don\'t know yet if there is a limit!), quick response messages for incoming calls and text message replies.. and so much more!WATCH FACESIf you\'re like me, having a solid, functional, aesthetically pleasing watch face that shows me everything I want to see right there on the screen is IMPORTANT! I am blown away by the FREE choices I haveavailable to me in the watch face area. The styles range from robust, simple, intricate, silly, stylish, digital, analog... And although I DID see the list ends at some point, I promise you will have found, downloaded, used and loved several before you get there.. and don\'t quote me on this, but I think they try to add new watch faces periodically, at least.OVERALL QUALITYIf I haven\'t bored you to death at this juncture, then I hope you have read, or can comprehend, that this smart watch WILL SPEAK FOR ITSELF IF I COULD NOT OR DIS NOT - PURCHASE IT, AND YOU WILL BE AMAZED, TOO!!!*** UPDATE: I ended up getting a refund for the purchase/issue mentioned below, which I immediately turned around and repurchased this Venus, again. Shortly after receiving my 2nd Venus, Touchelex had their customer care get in touch with me (they were extremely profuse in their apology for the delay in responding to me - it\'s astounding how genuinely they care about their product - as well as their consumers.. you don\'t see that anymore. With anything!). So every day for the last week, I have been messaging with a lovely customer service rep who has gone above and beyond in the pursuit of my happiness with this watch... The step count was off quite a bit on this 2nd purchase, and the rep provided every conceivable step I needed to take in order to correct what (to me) was the only thing ""wrong"" with this otherwise stellar, near-perfect smart device.', '**Revisión del reloj TouchElex Venus Smart Watch TGW008**He estado usando el reloj TouchElex Venus Smart Watch TGW008 durante unas semanas y estoy muy contento con él.

It's my fault I didn't read the whole description but you can respond to a phone call with auto-reply text built into the app. So far we like the faces, it's light e.t.c. The walking pedometer seems inaccurate because it shows so many steps that my mom took when she didn't walk that much. But I may be off I still need to retest it, we only had it for a week, so I will update it on accuracy. I will still give it a try and update this review. Customer service is excellent ! The sellers reached out to see if I received all three that I ordered.  I am still using it to make a final review but so far it's good for the price.Looks attractive and has a lot of options on the dial. For this price point, it's fine. Takes a little long to sync or download a new face dial but that's normal.. I need to test the accuracy of the pedometer. I Love the breathing exercises, the fun watch faces the overall look of the watch and the price. I will update this review once I use the watch longer. We had it for a week so far. Battery life is great! Maybe 3 or 4 days before you charge it, which is good because my other Samsung smartwatch I have to charge every day or often... I will keep you all posted. It looks pretty like the apple watch but I'm not about to pay 300 400 dollars yet for a smartwatch.This one will do for now. Pressing the button on the side may be a little harder compared to my Samsung but again it's two different watches so at this price point IT'S GOOD ENOUGH even just as a watch.. vibration on the wrist is good, reminders for my mom's prayers are good, etc. Has a lot of features, training, etc. SO FAR SO GOOD. Packaging was nice too comes with a charger, the face of the dial is clear and can be adjusted for bright light or dim. Has timer, alarm, yoga option, etc. I bought three of these and will see. 2 in the pink and 1 in the black. I will update this after I've used it longerUPDATED REVIEW JUNE 2023.  Fantastic. I've had this watch for a year now.  I bought one for my mom, myself.  BatterIy life is great! 3 days without charging. The price is great for the value and quality.  I get hourly reminders for water breaks and when I'm inactive. There's also an oxygen saturation feature.  My mom just uses it for basics but I use it for the pedometer, the water reminders, the breaks reminders, and the time.  I used this a lot. Easy to charge.  It may be a little challenging syncing up to the phone but it does sync with the app. The style of the faces is nice too. Other watches like the Apple ones are overpriced. This was a good deal.  I use it all the time.  It looks good too.  It serves my needs. I bought one in pink and black.  I used the computer a lot and it's nice to have a reminder to drink water or when remind me to move a bit after being sedentary. It has other features, but I mainly use it for the pedometer, reminders, time, ease, and having a lighted watch when it's dark so I can tell time. There are also breathing exercises. timed.  It's light on my wrist. Doesn't feel heavy. I used to have the Samsung Gear watch and the battery drains so fast. This one it's 3 days. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT WATCH FOR THE PRICE, FUNCTION, BATTERY LIFE, STYLE, FEATURES.  Try this before trying all those fancy high-priced smartwatches.  This is practical for the price. You don't need to spend so much money on those other watches when this one does pretty much the same basic features. It's a practical choice.  Simple features but important features for your lifestyle.  Sometimes simplicity is better.  I feel good about the choice I made because I saved money and yet have a practical, good-working smart watch for my needs.  It's been a year now and still works well. Nice screen too."", 'EDIT to the edit:  August 19, 2023- I managed to get the app working again.  Turns out I had to delete the app from the phone and reinstall it from the app store.  Now it works, but, of course, I had to go through the setup procedure again.  Still, it\'s working now, so I\'m changing my rating again.EDIT: July 2, 2023- After a year of good service, the company updated the app three days ago and now the app will not open on my iPhone 12 running iOS 16.5.1.  The app just crashes when I try to open it, so I can no longer store or access data, or change the watch face configuration.  They took a good product and ruined it.I\'ve been looking for an affordable smart watch to upgrade from my year-old Huawei ""Honor 5 Band.""  This watch looked like it would be a good choice, and a discount coupon sealed the deal.First to good news.  The watch has an anodized aluminum case and an AMOLED screen, and, although a bit large for my small wrist, it\'s quite thin, so it\'s not heavy or bulky.  Battery life appears to be excellent.  I\'ve worn it for two days now, playing with it frequently to try the various features and the battery is still at 89%.  Charging is fast and easy with the included magnetically coupled USB cable.  I use a spare iPhone charger.The App is well thought out and easy to set up and pair with the watch.  I\'m not sure why I would ""create an account and password.""  Fortunately, it wasn\'t necessary, as I set everything up using ""guest"" mode and everything worked seamlessly.  Speaking of setting up, this watch comes with something unexpected:  an actual user manual!  I mean a manual that actually explains how to set up and use the watch and how to access the various functions.  Not that the watch is hard to figure out.  On the contrary, the two button plus touch screen interface makes navigating the menus and functions a snap.  The operating system is well thought out and navigating the many features and optional settings is easy once you spend a few minutes with the watch.The display is sharp and beautiful, with crisp vibrant colors, and the selection of optional dial faces includes many beautiful and useful variations.  The optional faces can be easily swapped out in the app.  The app works well to track my walks and cycling and displays the route in the app.Now the problems:  When I set up the watch, I selected ""24-hour automatic"" for heart rate monitoring, but the monitor stopped recording at midnight, requiring me to restart the heart monitor ""manually"" the next morning.  Since then, it seems to have ""fixed"" itself, running continuously ever since.Next, is the sleep monitor.  I don\'t know how this device is supposed to actually tell when I\'m asleep or awake, but last night I know I was awake for nearly two hours in the middle of the night while the watch said I was asleep.  Also, when I awake in the morning, unless I get up and get moving, the watch can easily assume I\'ve fallen asleep again if I sit and read the news instead.This leads me to the step counter.  It seems like it\'s hard to get going in the morning, failing to register steps until I\'m up for about 45 minutes.  OTOH, it\'s a bit too sensitive to motion for accuracy.  Yesterday, I went for a ride on my motorcycle, during which I somehow accumulated 12,000 ""steps.""  Apparently, every bump in the road or movement of my wrist counts as a ""step.""  I\'ve not had this issue with the Huawei.  More refinement is definitely needed here.Other reviewers have mentioned connectivity issues.  I\'ve also seen this a couple times.  It seems to happen when the watch is out of range of the phone (in my case an iPhone 12 running iOS 15.5).  I\'m frequently out of range, as I don\'t carry my phone when I\'m around the house.  When the watch is brought back in range of the phone it doesn\'t always successfully reconnect, requiring a restart of the watch.  Also, the music control and weather screen occasionally lose contact with the iPhone.In all, this watch feels very much like the firmware is in ""beta"" release.  A great design, basically well executed, but ultimately flawed by some glitches that could be addressed with a firmware update(?) Will the manufacturer update the firmware to correct these issues?  That remains to be seen.EDIT:  After a week, the battery is still at 60%, very good.  Also, the maker has pushed an update to the app which seems to have fixed the connectivity issues.  Since the maker seems to be working to improve the experience, I\'m adding a star to my overall rating.', ""This was my very first Smart Watch. And after doing a lot of research, and reading many reviews, I chose this one. This watch is easy to read, easy to maneuver through. Everything is accurate. Lots of workout choices when using it to count calories, distance, heart rate, etc. And you have several categories and beautiful designs to choose from for your watch faces.I've had people ask me if it was an Apple watch, because it looks expensive. And yet, I am active in my job as well as personal. It's been banged around, but no scratches or damage to it. so I'm hard on it Just a very well made product all around."", 'Mi esposa está muy feliz con este reloj inteligente, el diseño es muy bonito y las aplicaciones están muy completas y sencillas de manejar. La app para manejarlo desde el móvil es muy intuitiva y permite varias actualizaciones de imagen.  Es una compra de la cual no se puede arrepentir, teniendo en cuenta su precio.', ""I’m pretty satisfied with the Venus smart watch so far. After using it for about three days. I’ve used some of the features but not all of them. Of the ones I’ve used, they all work well. The heart rate monitor seems about as accurate as most digital monitors. The current local weather conditions and three-day forecast stay updated so long as the watch stays in Bluetooth range of the phone you’ve paired it with. Most of what the watch does goes through the phone app, which is fine for a watch like this one.The watch face is changeable and they have quite a few to choose from, but you can’t make your own. It has an “always on” mode that will just display the time and nothing else (it turns off at 20% battery) but it runs the battery down quicker if you use it. By default, it’ll display nothing until you lift your arm and twist your wrist as you would naturally do to look at the watch display, and then the screen turns on automatically from the motion.It has plenty of exercise tracking modes (walking, running, hiking, yoga, steps, calories), though I’ve not tested any of them except the step counter. It seems about as accurate as most. Most of the watch faces you can choose from will display steps and calories burned without having to go to another screen, it’s usually on the watch face itself along with the time and date.The watch band is not the kind of cheap semi-stiff plastic you get with $12 watches, it’s much more flexible and it’s kind of grippy, so the watch will NOT slide around on your wrist. Once you have it tightened comfortably, that’s where it’s going to stay.It’s not as bulky as I was worried it might be. It’s actually smaller than my $12 cheap watch I replaced it with. It’s a very good size and quite pleasant to look at.As a night person, I actually haven’t seen how well the display looks in direct and indirect sunlight yet. You can adjust the display brightness and I’m sure you can set it bright enough to use during the day.Pairing with my phone was simple and worked the first time. I know a lot of devices can be a real pain to pair with (my billboard wireless earbuds I got from Dollar General are horrid to pair) but this watch was efficient. It also seems to have a good range, my watch stayed connected to my phone in two different rooms separated by a hallway.Overall I’m pretty happy with it for the price. It even comes in a pretty nice box package. People sometimes underestimate how important that is. Cheap boxes don't bode well for the product inside. This box package was pretty nice, and so is the watch."", '(Scroll down 4 Update) 3.5+ stars at $35 flash sale price. Bigger screen would go long way (actually software change to increase font size is all it needs. Lots of empty space). Has flashlight, timer, stopwatch, enough fit options. Weather not accurate (storming showed cloudy).1) Amoled Screen very nice. This watch needs to be 1.5"" or bigger as font hard to read. No directions in book! Spend several minutes to figure out (top button back, twice to function screen, bottom button shortcut to workout. Some screens swipe down additional screens. To get all functionality have to have app open on phone (like phone finder). Calls, Gmail, Messenger worked always but SMS text messages intermittent2) Every arm movement counts steps so some days 2000 over on watch than actual (pretty much all of them do this).3) Heart & Pulse Ox pretty accurate. No BP but doesn\'t say it has it and those watches have bad reviews for BP accuracy.4) Sleep sometimes accurate. Laying still reads light sleep. They all do this. Pretty accurate deep sleep measurement measurement.5) Incoming call with fast text response. Works well. Adding call answer speaker would be good but watches that do have some poor reviews.Overall for $35 price paid I really want to keep this but screen is just too small so will likely return (again really small font issue). Amoled reads well direct sunlight with brightness up. Night options and always on option. 5 days good use with heavy use.[UPDATE] UPGRADED TO 4 STARS, EXCELLENT SUPPORT. Company reached out. They can\'t change font but have a larger square watch available (LCD without Amoled though). I will be testing this. This 1.28 round watch does have a workout summary screen that font is larger than main screen to see steps/calories better. They are incorporating an update to NOT count steps until 15 ""ARM movements continuously"" so 14 or under will not read a step & ahould make sleep more accurateas well. Hopefully goes long way for accuracy. They are creating a digital user manual and will provide the link for access, I assume web link on card maybe QR code. It will not be a new book (see review for summary how to use watch, pretty intuitive with a little play). Very stylish watch, pretty good battery and I might buy just for casual wear again because it\'s nice. Don\'t know if band can be swapped for leather one but was never uncomfortable how it came.', 'This watch is maybe a little TOO responsive to “raise to wake” sometimes, while other times (rarely) doesn’t wake when you raise your wrist to check the time. In the latter case, you can just press a button to turn on the display. In my opinion, having an option to wake when you tap the screen instead of raising your arm might be a better fit.It measures your heart rate constantly during “sport” mode, and takes a reading at regular intervals the rest of the time. You can change the frequency in the settings, starting at 5 minutes. It can also measure your blood oxygen level manually, but doesn’t have an automatic reading setting. In my opinion, having it able to be set to automatic, even if only two or three times daily, would be even better.You can connect the watch data to Google Fit through the TouchElex app, and then set Google Fit as the pedometer in Noom, in order to use the watch with Noom. It would be easier if you could just connect the watch or app directly to Noom instead of going through Google Fit, but you can’t expect every app to be able to connect to every other app, so having a third-party app every relevant app is connected to and being able to share the data that way is pretty awesome.You can’t talk to people or listen to music on the watch, but I don’t know why you’d want to. You can see messages and even emails if you want to, or turn it off if you don’t. You can choose your own watch face based on your own preferences, or even use an actual photo as the background. Can track sleep cycle. Probably can do more things.This is written the day after I received the watch. Battery life is looking good, right on track for about seven days before it reaches zero. I’ve recorded my sp02 at least three times today, and will likely record it again later, so I may be eating up the battery life a bit faster than normal use. I also changed the timeout setting to 10 seconds instead of 5.First fitness watch I’ve actually liked, and it’s affordable. Way to go, developers.', 'The Good:I\'ve had all kinds of smartwatches from under $10 to well over $300, and this watch is quite impressive. For the low price I really wasn\'t expecting it. The UI is great, the look and feel of the watch is premium. I\'m almost tempted to get a screen protector cause this thing is so nice.I\'m a sucker for internal screen backgrounds and the app, ""TouchElex"", has them in spades. This app and GloryFit app have some of the best library for internal backgrounds. I\'d rather use an apps\' own backgrounds than give an app permission to my phone\'s files and photos. Yeah, not keen on that.But again, for the price I paid, this is a real gem. 💎✨️Oh, and it came FULLY CHARGED, I mean like at 97%. Noice!Customer Service:Man, this company really cares about the customer experience and ensuring the product works. I actually got messages from them on how they could help me. Though the problem resolved itself, so I didn\'t need any troubleshooting, it was refreshing to see a company actually read reviews and respond to customers. Ha! Customer service isn\'t completely dead!  Who knew? 🤷🏽\u200d♀️The Bad: **Update, 9/28/22**Connectivity...This was a challenge for me at first, but after unistalling and reinstalling the TouchElex app about 2-3 times the connectivity is now working just fine. Whew! I was this 🤏🏼 close to returning watch, which was gonna make me sad. I really like it, it\'s the best discount watch I\'ve ever owned. And I\'ve had a lot of \'em over the years!So, to anyone who\'s read this far, one, thank you for your indulgence and two, this is a good buy. You might experience some little hiccups, but those can be resolved. And if you need help, customer service is attentive and there to provide support! 🤝🏼']"

Great look and functional.  The only thing I would add is a pickleball fitness item in the exercise portion of the watch.', 'This watch is decent for the price point.  I have been using it now for a couple of months.  I did  have a question and the seller got back to me with the help I needed.  With my eye sight getting worse, the option to choose between different watch interface displays is a good one that I like.My average steps seems to match my old fitbit 7 day moving averages.  I have not done any ""scientific"" measuring on the steps, however, it is good enough for me.I do not use the heart rate or the blood pressure measurements.I did get a phone call when I first got the watch and it went through the watch with no issues.  I have turned that feature off since 99% of my calls are spam.Being able to get a glance at weather is a nice add on.There are lots of other features.  I have not explored them yet.  My main goal was to be able to tell time while I am outside working.  My secondary goal was to monitor physical activity in the form of distance travelled.  I am partially paralyzed and do not carry my phone on me.I would recommend this product based on the features I have used so far.  Service has also been good.', ""Firstly, the watch feels and looks great. I have used a premium galaxy watch for a few years and this watch is very comparable. The watch is very stylish and can be worn casually or dressed up. I have really enjoyed the long battery life because I sometimes forget to charge, but with this, I don't have to worry as I'm covered for most of the week. The health tracking features are awesome and seem reliable as I've compared the blood pressure and oxygen readings to my medical grade versions, and they are reasonably consistent. The app stores all the data and it's clearly presented. This is nice because I can get all the records and graphs to my doctor from this one app. The daily steps and workout tracking help me to easily know that I'm reaching my targeted goals everyday.As far as connecting it to my phone, the connection is seamless and I've been able to leave my phone a few rooms away, without losing connection while I'm on a phone call. The speaker is loud and sound is not distorted at higher volumes. My music also sounds nice through the speakers. For this price, I couldn't ask for more. This is the best extension to my phone and it does what it's designed to do very well. This is an easy recommendation, especially for the price."", ""Some people know that the heart rate on watches like this are super inaccurate but I went to the doctor and it was right on with the machine. Another thing is that you can customize it to any watch face you want. However don't get it wet some drops are fine but submerged underwater it will die"", 'Once you loaded watch faces into your smart phone app DaFit, they are permanent. There is no support to remove them. Email for support, no response. Do not waist your money on this watch. If you want a cheap Chinese watch, you can have one for a quarter of the price.', 'Well made good battery life. But not waterproof', ""At first I was impressed and really liked the watch, but that was short lived. I was able to wear the watch for 13 days. Next thing you know, for no apparent reason, the screen had all these lines across it and now the screen is completely washed out and you can't see anything. I never got it wet, took it off to wash my hands or take a shower. I've sent multiple emails with pictures to the contact on the card that came with the watch and have received no response! Save your money!UPDATE - Finally made contact through email, after my review, and they sent me a replacement watch plus refunded my initial purchase. Pleased with that. The replacement watch arrived quickly. Now time will tell if this one will hold up. Crossing my fingers! Will update review again later."", 'The only thing I dont particualary care for is the rubber strap. It irritates my skin. Going to be looking for a metal replacement soon. Other than that, it is a decent low cost smart watch.', ""This Smart Watch is extremely durable. Let me be the first to tell you that this smart watch is a tank. I've accidentally hit my watch on several doorways and dropped the watch a few times as well. Not a scratch, dent or ding on the watch yet.I also appreciate the battery life as well. I believe you can go roughly 1 full week without a charge.The setup is extremely easy. All you need to do is download the Da Fit to your phone. The App and Phone does the rest of the work.For the price this is a really nice smart watch. As I stated earlier this thing is built like a tank. I've seen smart watches that run up to roughly $1,000 and they're all made of plastic. Last time I checked this watch was roughly $80 and was made of strong aluminum or metal. I would definitely purchase this product again."", 'functionally appears to be exactly what I was looking for.  I\'m just not a fan of the ""apple watch"" styles and have always been more of a ""g-shock"" guy.  Initial setup was not difficult but accomplished only with ability to assume what to do and where.  Another review makes a comment about the booklet.....useless without a magnifying glass so my suggestion is to safe the paper and make it available for pdf download.....will be back once i\'ve had more time.Prompt and courteous communications with supplier when I had a simple question.Completely please at the moment 111']"
‎B09JWR1SJ2,HUAWEI Watch GT 3 (46mm) GPS + Bluetooth Smartwatch (Black) - International Version,Smartwatches,S$294.22,https://www.amazon.sg/HUAWEI-Watch-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Black/dp/B09JWR1SJ2/ref=sr_1_321?qid=1695864531&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051%2Cp_72%3A6469119051%2Cp_36%3A10000-90000&rnid=6450031051&s=electronics&sr=1-321,https://www.amazon.sg/HUAWEI-Watch-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Black/product-reviews/B09JWR1SJ2/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,4.5,"[""I used my GT 2 smartwatch with an android and iOS phone as my daily driver for a little over 2 years. I loved it. It was easily the best smartwatch I've used. It still worked just fine up until recently, when I ended up damaging it through hot water exposure (using in a hot tub and the gasket must've finally failed).Thankfully, Huawei's GT 3 was just released so I decided to purchase it (spent a day revisiting the Apple Watch but the battery life on their $750+ model still was only at ~36 hours which is unacceptable for a smartwatch, Samsung's watches are just as bad).As for the design of the watch, the removal of the bottom watch scroll wheel was a welcome choice as I've seen other GT 2 watches lose theirs from hitting the bottom on a railing or wall. The watch is fairly similar though for the most part as far as build quality and design goes. The watch uses fully wireless charging though now so you don't have to worry about the metal charging ports rusting or not connecting to the charger anymore. This was a lovely change.The battery performs about the same as the GT 2 though some of the new features such as continuous temperature tracking do eat up the battery life. I have to charge it every 5-7 days on average which for me is perfect (I charged my GT 2 about every 7 days). Granted I don't have an always on display but for me this is mainly a fitness tracker and notification checker. For those interested in a smartwatch that replaces your phone you'll need to seek out one of the other smartwatches from the major US brands that dies in ~16 hours.Returning to one of the issues with this watch, regarding the Huawei data collection and trade disputes currently going on, you must choose which intelligence agency you want harvesting your data. Do you want a domestic intelligence agency archiving your personal data or would you prefer a foreign intelligence agency archiving your personal data? For me the choice seems obvious.The unfortunate aspect of this pressure from American megacorporations on competitive foreign megacorporations is that the abilities on the iOS Huawei Health app and the watch itself are severely restricted. Some of the customized watchfaces that Huawei phone users have access to or music playback features are completely unavailable to U.S. Huawei users (and other Five Eyes Intel nation-state users).With the charged economic and political climate in the US this watch may be further restricted or eventually banned so bear that in mind.Still, with all of the uncertainty around Huawei products working in the US and the restricted features, it's still one of if not the best smartwatch on the market (the only other near competitor is the Apple Watch Ultra for the ECG tracking accuracy and slightly improved battery life)."", 'Great features.  Decent battery life. Comfortable wear. Not quite up to scratch on steps but no complaints at the price. Recommended', ""Loved the look, the feel.Always fancied a smart watch, but now I think they are overrated.Never use the other functions and hardly have it connected to my phone.I don't like the fact that it needs to be on tight.Overpriced."", 'This watch does everything that it is advertised to do. Battery life is fantastic and so many apps to choose from. Very impressed.', ""had this watch now for about 8/9 months. overall brilliant, tracks every thing i need includeing my steps, my sleep etc.The watch itself has a great screen, it clear easy to navigate all the options, i'm yet to purchase any other screen design ( theres alot of them available) as the free ones are good, so can change the design from more sporty relevance to more of a designer watch look for a night out etc. I think theres about 10 or so different free options.only negative point, not sure if its because i have the brightness turned up to full all the time or something else but the real world battery life is sadly not 14 days.  i would say 10/11 days though. I have been away with work/holidays etc since having the watch, once for 14 days, but was down to 10% on about day 10 or so.Thankfully I was able reverse charge the watch from my phone, I had checked before I left to save taking charging cable (doesnt take much room, but one less thing to worry about), obviously this wont be as quick as proper charger, but was sufficient to boost the watch till i returned home."", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Lindo relógio, bateria de longa duração, ótimo para atividades físicas e dia a dia.', ""It looks great and is accurate in all aspects.  Battery life is less than claimed but I use it full on.  With aod during 2 hr swim, gps at least an hour a day, spo and other metrics 24/7 I'm still get three days.  (I talked to Huawei and that's normal. ) The 10 day+ battery is if you just use it as a smartwatch. Screen is clear and hr moniters during swimming. I haven't discovered all the functions yet but this is the solid , good looking, well built, reliable smartchwatch I was looking for."", 'Bought as a gift for my mum.  She likes es her Huawei Band 7 tracker watch.  It was a mid price watch £50 and does the basics. She is in her 80’s and finds it easy to use. Though sorting out the app took time and patience.The watch was as advertised. It was a fast delivery. Excellent reliable service A+++ I would recommend this seller and would use them again.', ""This is a seriously good watch - if you are really into fitness training/running, the training guidance is great the amount of activities you can track is super and the battery life if great compared to the likes of OS Wear or Apple watch.  The apps for oxygen, heart and sleep tracking are all good too.  Now comes the bits that aren't so great.  If you do not have a Huawei phone you need to download the health app via an apk then you have to provide loads of permissions.  If you are worried about privacy - that could be an issue.  The watch and app work well together providing the permissions are all given and that takes time.  You can now reply to messages with a small keyboard or there are quick replies, but you can't talk to the watch in the way you can with Wear OS or Sri.  The voice assistant on the watch will only work with a Hauwei phone and there is no NFC or WiFi on this model - I didn't have an issue with the WiFi not being there but I do like paying with Google Pay or Samsung Pay from my wrist.however, if you only use the watch for fitness and rely on your phone for replying to messages and using the watch to merely read them then this is a super purchase - I would recommend this just for the battery if you are not fussed with all the bells and whistles.Confession, even though I thoroughly enjoyed using the watch and its fantastic battery, well...................its just not that smart, if you want the ability to respond to a text or message by voice I would suggest the Samsung Watch4 or Ticwatch Pro Ultra for android and the Apple watch for ios.  Forgot to mention the bluetooth calling works well and if you use android you can transfer music in a round about way.  Final point whilst there is an app store on the watch - there are not many apps due to the USA banning Huawei from Google.  I think Huawei will get better and better and they will bring smarter features and apps like Spotify and Strava in the fullness of time.  However, for the cost of the watch I prefer a little more charging with more functionality.  Hey but you do you and if you are in the Huawei eco system its a very good compliment to go with your other devices."", '']"

I would like to give it 4.5 stars as it is close from 5 stars than it is from 4 stars for that price, but Amazon doesn't include that option.I've been using this watch for a couple of months now, and while I had some problems at the beginning, after a factory reset the watch has been behaving very well. It certainly doesn't have the latest and greatest tech such as dual-band GPS or maps for context when you're following a route, but to be honest these are things I don't really Its accuracy is very good for a single band GPS (I usually set it to use GPS and GLONASS as I do MTB every weekend) and I've found that sometimes it even returned better accuracy than my Wahoo ELEMNT ROAM, which has dual-band GPS. I remember once I had a bug in the ROAM where the route was not loading in the computer, I used the navigation from the watch and it was very usable. Sure it was less convenient for the watch position and the sport, but it can get you out of a pinch and the compass is accurate enough to even track MTB in the trails.That being said, a very noticeable thing for me as soon as I got it from the box was the weight: maybe I was spoiled from my previous watch which was very lightweight, a Polar Vantage M2, but the quality of the materials and the extra components are immediately noticeable as soon as you pick it. In your wrist, you get used to it after a few days of wearing it, however, you need to be more careful when tightening the strap when you sleep, as it can produce inaccurate readings, or even detect long periods of time as 'unrecognized' if you press your watch against your body, as the weight will make it slide and lose contact with your skin.When it comes to sports, despite you can get used to the watch weight, you can certainly feel it when you are making any bouncy sport, such as mountain biking, and you need to set it very tight to avoid the bouncing to affect the heart rate readings much. Whereas the strap itself is comfortable (more on that later) a tight watch may be uncomfortable no matter what, in my case I use an external heart rate sensor, so I can set the watch a little loose and still get accurate data; you will still feel the watch bouncing, but it won't hurt your wrist, your mileage may vary on that end.The strap is from FKM rubber and whereas I had the impression of being bulky in the videos, it is very sleek and probably the most comfortable strap I've tried, it is very breathable, and it dries very quickly. I like it and I would probably switch it just for style or color matching for some occasions. When it comes to durability, the watch has proven to be very durable, I've had a couple of crashes in my MTB with zero damage to the watch, I've hit the bezel once against a metal gate and the one who got the pain chipped was the gate lol, and I've been using it both outdoors doing MTB every weekend and in the gym without any physical marks either on the watch or the screen so far. Time will tell as two months it too little to judge, but it seems promising.Many people have commented about the screen brightness, but I've had no issues whatsoever either using it indoors or outdoors with the brightness set at low. It is dimmer than other mineral crystal displays, but that is a sapphire thing, and it is present in any sapphire crystal display in any watch.  That aside, when I'm doing MTB and considering my handlebar is wide sometimes I don't even need to flick the wrist, sometimes I can get the HR by just glancing at it. In the gym I've noticed under the right lighting conditions the screen is not visible from an angle, but just moving your wrist a little makes it readable again and so far I don't find it annoying as I prefer that and having peace of mind with my screen not breaking easily or scratching at all, as I had to replace the screen protector in my previous watch every few months.I train between 8 and 12 hours a week in average, recording no GPS activities from Monday to Friday mainly being 45 minutes cardio sessions 5 times a week and three strength training sessions between 1 and 1.5 hours each and a long MTB ride on weekends for about 8 hours. With that usage I use to get between 5 and 6 days of battery life. It is not the most everlasting battery watch, but barely charging it once a week is good enough for me.When it comes to the touch screen, it surely is a nice to have feature, but it is not, by any stretch of the imagination, the best touch screen experience in any watch, let alone in any sports watch. The touch screen is disabled while doing sports, something I don't really mind. When it comes to everyday use, there is no back button gesture, which means you will have to rely on the physical button to do that, and that may be a small inconvenience to some. When you start interacting with the touch screen, there is a delay on the initial touch to the screen, which is slower to respond, and after the first interaction the consecutive interactions have a decent response time - for a sports watch - once you learn you need to tap and hold the screen for a fraction of a second with your first gesture and then proceed as normal, the touch is very usable, however, I can see that simple action can become very annoying for some people, and forgetting about it surely may turn the 'annoying' into a 'frustrating' experience. You get used to it after using it for a while; that being said, it should the watch the one to accommodate to the user needs, not the other way around.Nowadays for the original price, I think it's too expensive since the technology has advanced quite a bit, and it is missing features that have become normal in the industry, however, if you can get it under $450 I think even nowadays it is a good deal, I got mine for $430, but I've seen it even cheaper during some deals even here at Amazon. It is a good watch, and I am hoping to keep using it for the years to come."", 'Tenía un Coros Pace 2 y es un reloj fantástico, ligero, con muy buena visibilidad de pantalla y una conexión GPS muy rápida, las métricas que facilita también son muy completas. Lo único que no me acababa de convencer era la caja de plástico, que se veía un poco débil, y la aplicación del móvil, que daba una información un poco escueta, completa pero poco explicada. Estuve indagando y leí que los relojes de Polar, además de su calidad contrastada, tenían su aplicación Polar Flow muy completa, así que me decidí a probar el modelo tope de gama, que es este Polar Grit X Pro, y la verdad, creo que hecho una buena compra.Es un reloj más grandote que el Coros, mucho más sólido, tanto en el cristal de zafiro como en la caja, también pesa el doble, unos 63 gr. frente a los 31 gr. del Coros, pero no es molesto de llevar, uso la correa de tamaño pequeño y no lo noto incómodo. La visibilidad podría ser un poco mejor, es cierto, aunque se ve bien cuando lo pones con una iluminación lateral, hay determinados momentos que no se acaba de ver bien si no es con la luz (automática, eso sí), de todas formas, creo que es un punto a mejorar por Polar.Las métricas que te saca son muy completas en todo tipo de deporte, yo corro y camino y el análisis que hace de las carreras es muy completo y lo que más me gusta es el análisis que muestra en la app, que te explica todo muy bien para que se entienda por cualquiera. En el análisis de resultados creo que supera ampliamente a Coros, la verdad. La sincronización del reloj con la app es inmediata cuando terminas el ejercicio.En cuanto al GPS, igual de rápido y preciso que en Coros, en unos 20 segundos estás localizado, muy bien.La información durante el ejercicio es personalizable desde la app, muy bien también, todo a tu gusto.No se pueden cargar mapas completos como en los Garmin y otros relojes avanzados, pero puedes cargar rutas de Komoot y te sale una flecha para guiarte por dónde tienes que ir, te marca la altura que llevas, las pendientes y puedes indicarle volver al punto de partida y te da instrucciones para regresar, bueno, está bien.El reloj en sí me parece muy bonito y la correa de silicona es muy cómoda de poner y quitar y ajusta muy bien. La pantalla es táctil, pero también tiene margen de mejora, la sensibilidad se atasca un poco y no responde como en otros smartwatch menos deportivos, La ventaja de este es que con los 5 botones puedes hacer todo y la verdad es que ahora mismo me resulta muy cómodo y fiable. Me parecería mentira hace unos meses, pero se puede vivir sin una pantalla táctil.Las notificaciones, puedes elegir qué quieres recibir y qué no, pero no puedes responder, bueno, no es algo  imprescindible desde mi punto de vista. Por cierto, una cosa muy buena de este reloj (y también en Coros) es que al iniciar una actividad deportiva el reloj se pone en modo no molestar hasta que termina la actividad, a mi me encanta esa función, la verdad.La batería es buena, no dura tanto como anuncian, pero bueno. En mi caso, uso deportes con gps unas dos horas y media al día y me dura cuatro días, se queda al 20-25% y lo pongo a cargar. La carga es rápida, en torno a una hora.Bueno, el reloj es un poco caro, pero se pueden conseguir buenas ofertas, yo estoy muy contento con él, evidentemente es un reloj deportivo sobre otras cuestiones, así que si buscas un reloj fiable, bonito, preciso y con una buena app detrás, este es tu modelo.', 'Great Product.', ""The Polar Grit X Pro is a solid 4* product to me, unfortunately for the price it should be 5*. Despite being marketed as being for “outdoors” enthusiasts, the Grit X Pro’s feature set is still a little lacking compared to the competition in this respect. The watch is self is a good solid, high quality piece. Solid also means it’s a tad on the heavy side. I like the FKM strap but it seems to be a bit of a sweat trap. The screen is a decent enough size but the display itself is mediocre. It’s transflective, supposedly best in bright sunlight. Not exactly a big feature of the British climate. The display has poor contrast and colours are dull, far from vibrant but that’s the norm for displays of this type. It’s also a touch screen, which is the biggest waste of time going and generally a poor performer. Polar needn’t have bothered. Some of the on screen numerals and characters could do with being bigger too. I find battery life is ok but that's all. Heart rate monitoring is the best I've ever expereinced in a watch, closely rivaling Polar's chest strap monitors. I tend to only wear watches of this type when I’m doing an activity I want to measure and track. So the bucket full of 24/7 health, performance and sleep monitoring it does is superfluous to me. A lot of it is gym rat orientated rather than for “outdoorsy” people anyway. As far as outdoorsy goes. I don’t like that Polar do not have an integrated way within the Flow app for creating and uploading routes into the watch. You have to use third party products like komoot. A clunky approach! There is no barometer trend graph, like my Garmin Instinct has,  just internet sourced weather forecasts. That’s crap! Hills and mountains have their own weather, the forecast for the nearest town can be of no relevance. A barometric trend can warn you of changing weather. Also in the hills and mountains you can be out of internet connection for days if you are doing an extended trip. To much internet dependence is not good. The GPS sampling rate doesn’t really fit with hiking and walking either, you’ve either got 1 second or the next option 1 minute. It needs some options like 5 or 10 seconds. The power off function needs adding to quick links rather than being massively buried in the device menus. A decent firmware update could bump the Grit X Pro up to 5* quite easily."", 'Elegante, preciso, cómodo.Es impresionante, para hacer deporte monitoriza toda la actividad, sueńo, posicionamiento...La bateria dura mas de una semana haciendo deporte una mesia de hora y mesia al día.Multiples funciones y fácil manejo.', 'Optisch eine tolle Sportuhr/Smartwatch, aber- Displaygröße durch breiten schwarzen Rand ziemlich minimiert.- teilweise schlechte Ablesbarkeit.- Ziffernblattauswahl sehr bescheiden.- Touchdisplay reagiert häufig sehr träge, dadurch etwas schwerfällige Bedienung.- Was für mich auch irritierend war, dass man bei der Inbetriebnahme der Watch, Uhrzeit und Datum manuell erfassen muss. Dies legt die Vermutung nahe, dass kein Funkuhrwerk enthalten ist.

L\'altro era il samsung 5 pro, che costa molto di più. Non venitemi a dire: eh ma il garmin e ma questo e quello durano 85 giorni"". No, il loro sistema operativo non permette di aggiungere software personalizzati (detti comunemente APP), quindi li ho scartati. Se mai mi servirà un orologio che fa 100000 cose ma solo relative allo sport, ne prenderò uno. Questo ticwatch lo uso in modo generalista.Ottima idea quella del secondo schermo a cristalli liquidi che aumenta notevolmente l\'autonomia.Male le traduzioni in italiano dei vari software. purtroppo non si può cambiare lingua senza resettare tutto (grande google, ne farai mai una giusta? questo OS per orologi è quasi inutile. si salva solo perchè ci sono le app).la memoria disponibile all\'utente di meno di 4 GB mi sembra molto ristretta.l\'app per cellulare non la uso perchè fa pena, idem per l\'app di google; cerco di limitare la comunicazione tra orologio e cellulare, e fare il più possibile le cose o solo su uno o solo sull\'altro.una ottima funzione è quella del rilevamento del sonno e della sveglia durante la fase di sonno leggero.', 'Supera di gran lunga migliaia e migliaia di prodotti top di gamma che ci sono in commercio.Il punto di forza suo è il doppio schermo, per chi non usa tanto il S.O. con le app è ottimo che fa risparmiare tantissima batteria.Ottimo anche per chi fa un uso normale del S.O. con le sue app ma la batteria cala a circa 2ggHa tutto quello che un telefono possiede come calcolatrice sveglia ecc..Grazie al suo sistema ha il play store dove puoi scaricare tutte le app come Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, Telegram ecc..', ""Premetto che questo smartwatch è molto bello.

Una volta riacceso tutto normale, poi riprovando a bagnarlo la stessa cosa. Così ho contattato l'assistenza Amazon la quale mi suggeriva di rivolgermi prima al produttore che, invece, mi rimandava ad Amazon. Così ho fatto e senza battere ciglio mi hanno fatto fare il reso. Ora visto che è uscito il nuovo ed aggiornato 5 Pro, procederò all'acquisto, sperando che il suddetto problema, o altri, non vengano a presentarsi.L'applicazione proprietaria c'è da dire che è molto molto deludente, scarna, ed a tratti anche non tradotta in italiano!"", 'Premessa: ho avuto un apple watch serie 2 prima di passare ad android + Samsung Gear S3 Frontier e cercavo uno SmartWatch che ci si avvicinasse.Ho preso questo ticwatch attratto dall\'autonomia e dal doppio display, oltre che dalle innumerevoli recensioni positive. Cercavo uno SW con un tracciamento gps/cardiaco affidabile che mi permettesse di gestire chiamate e messaggi (in particolare in bici) e di andare a correre senza portarmi dietro il telefono, ascoltando la musica. Anticipo subito che non sono riuscito a fare niente in modo soddisfacente.Pregi:-tracciamento battiti affidabile-display LCD ben visibile al sole-buona durata della batteria (2 giorni con tutti i sensori attivi)-esteticamente molto bello, almeno per meDifetti:-vibrazione rumorosa-interfaccia non curata: se usate il pin, dovrete sempre toccare il campo testo prima di vedere la tastiera, tasti/icone piccole e difficili da centrare, nessuna shortcut su schermo per chiamata in corso e, se si lancia una chiamata dall\'orologio tramite rubrica (l\'assistente non funziona), la passa al telefono e torna alla watch face, senza più alcun controllo su di essa-fix GPS variabile dai 30 ai 120 secondi, a cielo aperto e nello stesso punto-con GPS attivo, la connessione bluetooth con gli auricolari è molto scarsa ed inutilizzabile con le mie Jabra Elite 75T-si sente la mancanza di una ghiera/corona per la navigazione-illuminazione del display LCD non regolabile in intensità: si accende inutilmente al massino di giorno, idem la notte se usato per il monitoraggio del sonno-Google Assistant (ad oggi praticamente inutile): non si possono inviare messaggi (per SMS si arriva all\'invio, poi dice errore di rete, per whatsapp chiede in continuazione il nome del contatto, ma non va mai oltre), non è ancora possibile effettuare chiamate, non apre le app, chiedere indicazioni per un qualsiasi posto/indirizzo risponde correttamente, ma lo SW rimane con schermo nero e non fa vedere niente-Traduzione in italiano scarsa ed interfaccia poco curata-Scarsa reattività dello schermo in certe condizioni: capita spesso di toccarlo in modalità smart (LCD) e che non si accenda, oppure di toccare un punto (troppo spesso piccolo, come l\'ingranaggio per la personalizzazione della watch face ad esempio) e non avere rispostaNel complesso, trovo che non abbia senso prendere uno smartwatch di questo tipo allo stato attuale. Se lo scopo è usarlo per il fitness, allora c\'è di meglio (vedi garmin ad esempio), se invece cercate qualcosa per la parte ""smart"", allora aspettate che google sistemi il tutto perchè così non solo non si avvicina proprio all\'apple watch di 5-6 anni fa, ma fa pure peggio del vecchio Frontier con Tizen ed il suo hardware datato.Nel dettaglio: l\'uso della modalità smart (LCD) è senz\'altro valido, ma ha delle pecche. La retroilluminazione non è regolabile e, di giorno, non serve nel 99% dei casi. Sarebbe stato utile che si regolasse con il sensore di luminosità, come per il display principale. Alla fine l\'ho disattivata.Di notte è vero il contrario: durante la notte se ti muovi si accende al massimo mentre dormi e, se vicino al viso, mi sveglia. Disattivata quindi anche per la notte, che tenevo in essential mode, di fatto rendendola inutile. Ho notato inoltre che, da modalità smart, talvolta il tocco su schermo non lo riattiva. In generale l\'impressione è di poca reattività e che nessuno abbia testato il software, soprattutto non in lingua italiana.Test in bicicletta: ricevo un messaggio su whatsapp e rispondo, tutto ok. Dopo poco ho necessità di mandare un messaggio, provo allora a mandarlo su whatsapp, niente. Provo con un SMS, sembra andare ma, alla fine, solito errore. Provo a fare una chiamata e l\'assistente si rifiuta. Chiedo allora di aprire i contatti e, come al solito, l\'assistente non riesce. Mi fermo, apro i contatti manualmente e lancio la chiamata, che passa al telefono e torna alla watch-face. Non sono riuscito a trovare il modo per recuperarla su orologio e sono stato costretto a prendere il telefono dallo zaino. Con il vecchio Frontier, le chiamate riesco a farle e riceverle senza problemi, oltre che a gestirle da orologio senza dover prendere il telefono.Test Corsa: Scendo in strada con orologio al polso ed auricolari bluetooth, niente telefono. Connetto le cuffie e lancio la musica da orologio. Tutto ok, sento la musica normalmente. Apro TicEsercizio, seleziono corsa all\'aperto e attendo i 2 minuti necessari per trovare la posizione. Mentre attendo l\'audio va e viene, come se avesse delle interferenze. Provo a tenere la mano sinistra (con orologio) al petto, ma l\'audio rimane ballerino. Alzo la mano all\'altezza della testa e torna a funzionare. Parto, ma appena abbasso le mani ricomincia a saltare pesantemente. Parto lo stesso per vedere se la situazione è temporanea o meno: non lo era, ho fatto tutta la corsa con le mani ad altezza spalla per avere un audio appena accettabile. Inoltre, quando arrivo ad 1 Km, la descrizione della tappa non abbassa il volume dell\'audio come sul Frontier, quindi non si capisce niente. Al Km 2 disattivo la musica per sentire: spelling pessimo (ad esempio Km letti ""kappaemme""), nessuna pausa fra le varie frasi....disattivato.

Questo Ticwatch Pro 3 Ultra ha un sacco di promesse da mantenere per convincere un affezionato utente degli smartwatch della serie Ticwatch.Ho deciso di comprare questo Pro 3 Ultra con qualche riluttanza iniziale: in primo luogo, infatti, il mio vecchio Ticwatch Pro (primo modello commercializzato) è ancora perfettamente in funzione come mio smartwatch giornaliero e in secondo luogo iniziavo a strizzare l’occhio tipologie di smartwatch dall’aspetto un po’ meno ordinario, un po’ meno somigliante a un cronografo regolare. Ma alla fine mi sono lasciato convincere dalla scheda tecnica di questo Pro 3 Ultra e dalla sua praticità.Di seguito cercherò di spiegare meglio quali sono secondo me i pro e i contro di questo ultimo arrivato della famiglia Ticwatch. Avendo posseduto e provato altri dispositivi wearable e non solo Ticwatch (Fitbit, Microsoft, Xiaomi, etc. etc.) per me sarà quindi inevitabile paragonare questo smartwatch con il suo predecessore o altri dispositivi precedentemente testati e posseduti.Indossabilita’ e aspetto.Devo dire che questa volta con questo Pro 3 Ultra, Mobvoi ha fatto proprio un ottimo lavoro di ottimizzazione su aspetto, peso e dimensioni. Piu sottile e leggero della prima versione e quindi anche comodo da indossare, a volte il suo predecessore non lo indossavo tutti i giorni perché’ dopo un po’ stancava: era pesantuccio e quasi un po’ ingombrante, infatti puntualmente andava ad impattare tutte le superfici vicino alle quali lavoravo (la mia scrivania, pareti metalliche di server e nas, pareti in generale ed altro), quindi stavo sempre in paranoia per non farlo graffiare, togliendolo e indossandolo di continuo o coprendolo con maglie e felpe per proteggerlo. Questo Pro 3 Ultra invece, devo dire la verità, lo tengo sempre con piacere sul polso e spesso me ne dimentico, dormendoci anche la notte (cosa molto buona poi per il monitoraggio del sonno). Anche solo a guardarlo da una sensazione di robustezza e leggerezza dei materiali utilizzati, con la sua finitura metallica opaca che lo rende sempre attuale e resistente a ""sabbia e polvere, pioggia, radiazione solare"" e molto altro (fonte sito Mobvoi).La piccola ghiera metallica che incastona il display, non stanca affatto, richiama sempre l’aspetto classico di un cronografo ma non snatura la sua anima smart. Il display sembra più ampio e luminoso, complice anche la sottile cornice nera che si vede tra lo schermo e la ghiera; infatti, se si utilizza una watchface scura o nera la sensazione di ampiezza dello schermo aumenta enormemente.Per quanto riguarda il cinturino poi è stata una mossa molto intelligente quella di mantenere il 22mm come standard, posso addirittura riutilizzare i numerosi cinturini che avevo comprato per il vecchio modello, dandogli ogni volta un aspetto adatto all’occasione.AutonomiaSi conferma vincente la soluzione del doppio display come sul modello precedente, grazie infatti a questa ‘trovata’ si arriva a un giorno e mezzo senza problemi, a volte anche oltre, dipende come e quanto si usi lo smartwatch, soprattutto l’uso delle funzioni ‘smart’.Mobvoi dal canto suo dichiara una durata di 72 ore in modalità smartwatch e di 45giorni in Essential mode, si esatto, avete letto bene, 45 giorni (precisamente 577mAh sotto il cofano). Ma in questo caso penso che urge una spiegazione in merito. Questo smartwatch (cosi come tutta la serie Pro) è dotato di tue display sovrapposti: Un display FSTN e un display AMOLED da 1,4 pollici. Ma come funzionano? Come fa questo display sovrapposto a garantire allo smartwatch una durata cosi enorme? Ricordiamoci un attimo come funziona il display su un regolare wearOS: il display si attiva automaticamente ruotando il polso o interagendo con esso e se non lo si utilizza per qualche minuto o secondo (in base alle vostre impostazioni), va automaticamente in uno stato di standby dove mostra solo l’ora o delle informazioni basilari, detto anche Always-on display, ma in questo caso il display è sempre e cmq attivo anche se solo in quella piccola porzione (nel caso di display oled e amoled) dove si visualizzano le informazioni basilari (ora e data). Quindi in questo caso il consumo della batteria dipende molto dal tipo di display e dal tipo di watchface che si ha al momento in uso.Sul Pro 3 Ultra accade qualcosa di diverso. Avendo due schermi sovrapposti, il display AMOLED principale non va praticamente mai in standby, ma quando non è più in uso si spegne direttamente, portando il consumo della batteria a 0. Una volta spentosi il display principale, entra in gioco il display FSTN, che assomiglia a tutto e per tutto ai vecchissimi orologi a cristalli liquidi, questo tipo di schermo, non mostra soltanto le informazioni principali come ora e data, ma anche la batteria dello smartwatch stesso, i passi ed i battiti. Quindi questo schermo sovrapposto entra in funzione automaticamente allo standby dello smartwatch oppure in un\'altra circostanza, quando la batteria scende sotto una soglia da noi impostata, oppure manualmente attivando la modalità Essential, attivando questa funzione infatti noi volontariamente scegliamo di utilizzare lo smartwach in modalità ridotta (essential appunto) facendo a meno delle varie funzionalità smart e utilizzandolo solo con quelle che sono le informazioni visibili sul display FSTN. Personalmente ritengo che questa trovata sia davvero geniale in situazioni un po’ critiche dove si dimentica il caricabatterie a casa o dove si ha l’esigenza di estendere la batteria di parecchie ore.Per quanto riguarda invece alle 72 ore in utilizzo smart, penso che si faccia sempre riferimento a uno scenario di utilizzo ottimale con poco o nulla utilizzo di app e sensori vari. Quando invece si iniziano ad usare le varie app e ad attivare ed usare tutti gli altri sensori la durata della batteria crolla drasticamente, senza parlare di quando il GPS è in uso. In conclusione non si può fare una frittata senza rompere qualche uova, quindi è nomale che se si vuole utilizzare tutta la pletora di app e sensori a disposizione, bisogna un po’ rinunciare all’autonomia.La ricarica inoltre è molto più veloce del primo modello e in poco tempo si ha lo smartwatch pronto per essere indossato. Unica enorme pecca per me è la modalità di ricarica scelta da Mobvoi: infatti è ancora di tipo magnetico con i pin metallici. Con il vecchio modello ho avuto non pochi problemi per via di questo tipo di connessione per la ricarica, portandomi addirittura a comprare 3 diversi caricatori e a pulirli con regolarità per garantire una connessione dei pin sempre efficiente, il più fastidioso di tutti poi era il continuo avviso acustico di Windows di connessione/disconnessione di un dispositivo usb, a volte mi dava talmente tanto fastidio che preferivo non usare del tutto lo smartwatch. Spero che con questo nuovo modello abbiano quantomeno migliorato questa cosa e devo dire che fino ad ora non ho ancora avuto nessun problema. Avrei preferito di gran lunga, visti i modelli delle compagnie concorrenti per questa fascia di prezzo, qualcosa come la ricarica wireless, molto più sicura e meno problematica.In linea di massima cmq posso ritenermi molto contento dell’autonomia generale, si vede che è stata migliorata di molto in questo modello, sarà per una migliore ottimizzazione da parte del produttore, un processore con un dispendio energetico diverso o dell’ultima release di wearOS, ma fatto sta che il consumo energetico sembra più costante e distribuito nell’arco della giornata e la frequenza di ricarica non è cosi alta o poco stabile come con il primo ProIl Display AMOLED da 1,4 pollici con 454 x 454 pixel con la sua risoluzione alta poi è uno spettacolo per gli occhi.OS ed esperienza utenteLa mia prima esperienza in campo di smartband o smartwatch e’ stata con un Fitbit Charge HR e in quel caso l’OS non era minimamente paragonabile a quello che abbiamo oggi, si limitava giusto ai passi, all\'orario ed al battito cardiaco. Il secondo dispositivo e’ stato l’indimenticabile Microsoft band 1, ma meglio non aprire questa dolorosa parentesi, anche perche\' era un dispositivo molto fine a se stesso e non sarebbe un utile metro ti paragone ora. Poi sono passato al TicWatch E, mi ci sono trovato benissimo sin dal primo giorno, peccato per la plasticosita\' dei materiali e per la scarsa autonomia, non da meno qualche impuntamento qui e la che snervava un po\' troppo. Da li il passo successivo e naturale e’ stato il modello Pro, che devo dire la verita’, uso ancora oggi come muletto o per qualche test particolare, nonostante un po’ lento a volte (colpa gli anni ed il processore non di ultima generazione). Quindi qui i due termini di paragone sono wearOS su un vecchio processore e su questo nuovo Pro 3 Ultra, penso che si capisca già chi la vince.Il Pro 3 Ultra monta, infatti, un processore Snapdragon Wear 4100 e si stente. La RAM è di solo 1 gigabyte di RAM ma fa il suo dovere e sono 8 i gigabyte di archiviazione interna per app ed il resto. Quindi paragonato al fratello minore che iniziava ad avere quale pesante lag e rallentamento dopo l’aggiornamento a wearOS 2 la differenza si sente e si vede, con un OS sempre scattante e reattivo nel caso del Pro 3 Ultra. Vedremo cosa succederà poi quando verrà rilasciato l’aggiornamento a wearOS 3 a metà 2022.Benché io non sia una persona particolarmente attiva (almeno durante la settimana lavorativa), trovo molto comodi gli avvisi di sedentarietà e tutto il comparto di app per il fitness e per la salute che funzionano in concerto con i vari sensori: saturazione sanguigna, rilevamento dello stress, monitoraggio costante del battito cardiaco (con infrarossi), rilevamento di separazione dal polso. Quest’ultima incarnazione del Ticwatch Pro sembra quindi più votato all’attività fisica, ci sono infatti diverse attività fisiche aggiunte anche nell’app proprietaria, tra cui il nuoto (finalmente!). Inoltre ci sono i reminder per línattivita\', per bere acqua e altre piccole chicche che ti aiutano a non dimenticarti di prendere una pausa e fare quattro passi durante la giornata. Le gesture per controllare il dispositivo e muoversi tra le varie sezioni funzionano bene e fanno il loro dovere, a volte ci sta qualche piccolo impuntamento quando si vuole scorrere le notifiche in alto, ma penso che questo sia più dovuto a una questione di abitudine.In conclusione l’OS e la relativa esperienza utente si confermano ottime come sempre anche se il discorso è un po’ fine a se stesso e dipende molto dalla dotazione del dispositivo stesso in materia di processore e di RAM. La stessa esperienza utente che vedo un po’ compromessa nel fratello minore che ovviamente dopo tutti questi anni di onorato servizio inizia a di mostrare i primi segni di cedimento. Peccato solo per l’NFC che non riesco ancora a sfruttalo, qui dove vivo la mia banca non concede l’utilizzo di Google pay, peccato.AppL\'app companion di Mobvoi finalmente riesce a mostrare qualche risultato chiaro e di facile lettura, anche se non raggiunge ancora i livelli di chiarezza di Google (less is more) ma apprezzo davvero molto lo sforzo fatto in questa direzione. La connessione allo smartphone e’ molto semplice e intuitiva, come con tutti i wearOS d\'altronde. Impostazioni e settaggi configurati in pochi minuti, il resto delle ore spese al primo setup se ne sono andate per la costumizzazione e le watchfaces, ce ne sono tante e tutte molto belle e qualcuna sembra sia un esclusiva di questo modello e altre che avevo anche sul precedente Pro, peccato solo per la magnifica watchface di supermario del GTH che non trovo per wearOS. Parlando si customizzazione, nell’app companion pare che sia stato aggiunto una sezione dedicata per le watchfaces e se ne possono scaricare di nuove, di cui molte gratis, peccato solo per la predominanza della lingua cinese il che rende a volte l’utilizzo dello poco pratico.La controparte sullo smartwatch è molto pratica e finalmente con i dovuti dettagli del caso. Ci sono molte app di Mobvoi preinstallate, alcune inedite e altre che vanno a sostituire le canoniche di Google wearOS, dedicate alle singole funzioni dello smartwatch: TicSleep per il sonno, TicHealth per i passi e minuti di esercizio fisico, TicExercise, TicPulse, TicOxygen e cosi via. Si possono sempre usare le app di Google se si preferisce, per il momento mi sto concedendo del tempo per testare quelle di Mobvoi, conoscendo già molto bene quelle canoniche, e vedere poi con quale delle due mi trovo meglio. Ovviamente quando usi un wearOS devi ricordarti che è un po’ come usare un dispositivo Android, puoi installarci il mondo intero su, ma poi non lamentarti se gira tutto lento, nota a parte il fatto di poter scegliere le app che ti piacciono di più e semplicemente installarle è semplicemente fantastico.In conclusione questo Ticwatch Pro 3 ultra e\' una riconferma del suo predecessore ed anzi un upgrade su molti punti. Uno smartwatch solido, di buona fattura, con buoni materiali e con un sistema operativo che gira senza lag o impuntamenti (almeno per ora), che ti da una libertà di utilizzo e customizzazione senza precedenti, il compagno ideale per ogni avventura. Certo il prezzo non è proprio basso e in effetti bisogna fare una scelta ponderata prima di acquistarlo ma penso che alla fine della fiera ne valga molto la pena e non ha paura di mostrare i muscoli nei confronti della concorrenza.', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa01.- Experiencia de usuario1.1.- En la muñeca. Antes de comprar este reloj estuve valorando mucho todos los contrincantes que tenía y después de horas y horas de vídeos en YouTube, ver diferentes opiniones y valoraciones, opté por este modelo. Recuerdo incluso, recortar la silueta del reloj en cartón, para hacerme a la idea de cuán grande sería sobre mi muñeca… y el resultado era preocupante. Pero las características pesaron más que esa impresión de armatoste y me aventuré con la compra. Cuando abrí el paquete me di cuenta de lo enorme que era el reloj y me preocupé un poco. Sin embargo he de reconocer que esa sensación comenzó a desvanecerse en el momento en que se instaló a vivir alrededor de mi muñeca. Sin duda, era grande, pero creo que esa sensación venía de lo habituado que estaba a mi anterior pulsera de actividad (una smartband de XAOIMI). No me hicieron falta nada más que unas pocas horas para habituarme a su tamaño y he de reconocer que lo siento muy cómodo, incluso para dormir.1.2.- Pantalla táctil. La pantalla no deja de llamar mi atención: la nitidez, el contraste, su visión en ambiente soleado y su facilidad para personalizar ciertos aspectos. En cuanto a la respuesta táctil he de reconocer que es muy fluida en sus desplazamientos (se nota el potente procesador que tiene detrás) y lo que más llama mi atención es que se pueda escribir (para responder mensajes de WhatsApp, por ejemplo) de manera muy acertada, con un teclado minúsculo que goza de toda la capacidad de Gboard de Google. Lo increíble de la respuesta táctil, es que la pantalla AMOLED con la que se interactúa está por debajo de la pantalla FSTN.1.3.- Acceso a las funciones. Para acceder a los diferentes menús o funciones a través de hardware tenemos dos botones y la propia pantalla. El botón superior nos permite, con una pulsación corta, activar la pantalla para entrar a lo que sería el modo “home”, donde dependiendo de la esfera que tengamos podremos disfrutar de una información u otra. En caso de una pulsación larga nos abrirá el asistente de Google, con opción de interactuar directamente por voz. En el caso del botón inferior, podremos optar por configurar la apertura de cualquier aplicación con una pulsación corta (yo por ejemplo he configurado la linterna). Con una pulsación prolongada nos abre un submenú que da acceso a las opciones de “Drenaje de altavoz” ( la uso siempre al salir de la ducha), modo esencial (anula todos los sensores excepto el pulsómetro y contador de pasos, que siguen funcionando mostrando además de esa información, la hora y la fecha).  En el caso de la interacción con la pantalla los gestos que están programados de serie permiten desplazar en diferentes direcciones: de izquierda a derecha, el asistente de Google te informa de eventos, te da opción a accesos directos, etc. De derecha a izquierda aparecen las tarjetas inteligentes que se pueden seleccionar a través de la app Wear OS para móvil. Si desplazamos la pantalla de arriba a abajo, aparecerá el menú rápido de ajustes, permitiendo acceso a botones rápidos para el modo avión, modo silencio, localizador de móvil, etc. Si está activado el pago con NFC también aparecerá un botón para tener más control sobre esa función. Importante también el acceso desde aquí al menú ajustes. Si desplazamos desde la pantalla Home el dedo hacia arriba desde la parte inferior, aparecerán las notificaciones pendientes de consultar, todas ellas fieles a las que aparecen en nuestro móvil, sumando aquellas propias del reloj en las que por ejemplo nos animan por lo bien que estamos ejercitándonos o invitándonos a caminar más.2.- Funciones2.1.- Monitorización de la salud. Esta parte he de reconocer que me abrumó. El reloj puede medir cuantas veces late tu corazón (de una manera bastante acertada, si bien dependiendo de la actividad puede dar alguna lectura errónea tal y como me ha ocurrido bajando por algunas sendas empedradas con bicicleta). También mide la cantidad de O2 que tienes en sangre (la increíble magia del hombre blanco). Mide el ruido que hay a tu alrededor y te avisa si el entorno es preocupante para la salud de tus oídos. También mide la calidad de tu sueño (para ello también te escucha por si roncas). Y si bien todos estos son sistemas pasivos para analizar tu salud, también tiene otros sistemas activos, y que a mi parecer son prescindibles, como por ejemplo que te aconseje sobre un correcto lavado de manos, o que te guíe para hacer una respiración de relajación… Todo lo relativo a salud es un paquete propio de Mobvoi y siempre con el apellido Tic. SaludTic, OxígenoTic, PulsoTic, SueñoTic, ZenTic, RespiraciónTic, OídoTic, TicCare, ...lo dicho: abrumador. Podría prescindirse de la inmensa mayoría de estas aplicaciones, y más teniendo en cuenta la oferta disponible en Google Play.2.2.- Navegación GPS. Comparando con otros dispositivos, en mis salidas a correr o en bicicleta, suele ser muy acertado con la realidad. Dependiendo del entorno capta más o menos satélites, pero las imprecisiones las noto más en el factor altura que en le factor distancia. Lógicamente no es un GARMIN, que podría clavar mejor los recorridos, pero sobre Wear OS creo que es lo mejorcito que ofrece el mercado en este sentido. Además de la aplicación EjercicioTic, que es la que uso para mis salidas, también se puede usar la ubicación GPS sobre otras apps como Google Maps.2.3.- Sonido y llamadas. Con alguna aplicación es posible escuchar las notas de voz de WhatsApp, y también por supuesto durante las llamadas. No es mejor que el manos libres del teléfono, pero te resuelve muy bien si el entorno es favorable. No vale para hablar en un autobús, pero sí para estar en casa o en un lugar poco ruidoso y tener tu momento Michael Knight “Kit, ven a recogerme!”. Para alarmas, tonos y sonidos es más que satisfactorio. El asistente de Google no te permite enlazar con la función teléfono diciéndole el nombre de un contacto pero puedes burlarlo diciendo que llame a un número que le facilites. Los interlocutores sienten la llamada como desde el manos libres del teléfono. Es necesario aproximar algo el reloj a la cara para que se te escuche.2.4.- Duración de la batería. Pues como todo. Dependiendo de lo que toquetees y de la cantidad de sensores que tienes activos. Yo, recibiendo notificaciones y haciendo un uso discreto he llegado a los 4 días (se ve en una de las imágenes), pero en esas jornadas no hice ninguna salida a correr o bici. Con salidas, depende de las horas de GPS, me aguanta entre 2 y 3 días completos. Eso sí, hay que tener en cuenta que se esté con la última versión de Wear OS disponible (se descarga a través de  la app Googel Play del reloj, ya que hay alguna intermedia que drena la batería de una manera horrible). La carga de la batería debe realizarse con un cargador de 1A, pero en mi caso estoy comprobando que un QuickCharge 3.0 lo mima bastante bien, al detectar que su demanda de intensidad y adaptarse a ella.3. Conectividad y compatibilidad3.1.- El reloj permite cargar música en su memoria interna, y esta música se puede reproducir a través de su altavoz o a través de auriculares bluetooth que se conecten a él. En mi caso, sin mucha dificultad, pude enlazar unos AirBuds de XIAOMI. También se puede reproducir música a través de apps como Spotify.La conexión bluetooth es muy estable si bien no soporta grandes distancias. En ella se basa por ejemplo, los avisos que se pueden activar de conexión y desconexión del smartphone, función que utilizo por si me olvido el móvil en algún sitio.El wifi es fluido y permite la interacción con dispositivos de Google Home sin necesidad de estar presente o activo el smartphone. Es decir, puedo encender las luces de casa directamente con el reloj sin necesidad del móvil, gracias a la conexión wifi.La sincronización con el smartphone es un poco engorrosa, pues por un lado se hace necesaria la app de Wear OS en el teléfono a efectos de configuración, pero por otro lado para recabar toda la información que arroja el reloj toca entrar a jugar con otra app propia de Mobvoi.4. Resistencia al aguaEste punto para mi era crucial. Y soy conocedor de la controversia que genera. Trabajo como bombero y la protección que ofrece este dispositivo con sus estándares militares y su resistencia a agua y polvo era un aspecto importante para mí. El reloj lo uso para el día a día y no lo quito para trabajar, todo lo contrario. Me ducho con él, voy a la piscina (no mido mis entrenamientos en piscina pues es a modo recreativo), a la playa, lavo los platos, etc. Jamás he tenido problema: este es el segundo Ultra GPS que compro, ya que así evito tiempos de espera en la carga y puedo andar turnándomelos. Llevo con el primero desde que comenzó a comercializarse en España (octubre 2021) y jamás he tenido ningún problema con el agua. Es mi experiencia y se base en que tengo desactivada la activación táctil de la pantalla AMOLED, así como la activación al levantar la muñeca (ya que me molesta al dormir) y después de mojarlo siempre le hago un “drenaje de altavoz”. Tampoco toqueteo los botones bajo el agua… A mí de momento me va de fábula y todos esos casos que hay de gente que reporta problemas por el agua no me generan ninguna controversia. Yo lo mojo con toda la tranquilidad del mundo...', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Je remplace ma TicWatch Pro 3 GPS par cette nouvelle TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra GPS, elle s\'ajoute ainsi à ma petite collection de montres : LG Urbane (la 1ere et plus ancienne), une TicWatch E (très fun) et une Galaxy Watch 4.La TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra est pour moi d\'une courte tête la plus performante et la plus endurante de toute : elle sait tout faire ou presque et possède une autonomie record et tout ça sans se trainer (oui au tout début les montres Wear OS c\'était très très lent, pas insurmontable car je porte encore ma LG qui est très paresseuse)La TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra est donc capable de donner l\'heure :D, de relayer efficacement les notifications de votre téléphone (et à mon sens c\'est mieux que sur une Galaxy Watch), faire du suivi d\'activité sportive (y compris la natation) et un suivi santé en particulier :le suivi du sommeil, la surveillance de la saturation en oxygène, la surveillance de votre fréquence cardiaque et de votre état physique et mental sur 24 h (nouveauté sur la TicWatch Ultra par rapport à la Pro 3).La surveillance du niveau d\'oxygène se fait en continu et c\'est un plus notable. La mesure ne se fait que lorsque vous êtes immobile et que votre montre est correctement ajustée à votre poignet. On arrive donc à avoir quelques mesures fiables de la saturation au cours de la journée et pendant la nuit.Le grand atout de cette montre c\'est son écran, on dispose d\'un grand écran AMOLED couleur comme sur toutes les montres connectées, mais en plus au dessus de celui ci on dispose d\'un écran cristaux liquides tout simple (comme sur une montre non connectée) qui s\'active automatiquement lorsque l\'écran couleur se met en veille. Double avantage : cet écran est lisible en extérieur en plein soleil et aussi la nuit grâce à un faible rétroéclairage qui fait parfaitement le job et sur cette version Ultra on peut désormais en changer la couleur, ce qui est pratique car sur la TicWatch Pro 3 précédent, la nuit c\'était un peu puissant. Cet écran secondaire permet de réduire considérablement la consommation d\'énergie. Ce faisant la durée de la batterie est impressionnante :en une journée, montre portée la nuit avec suivi du sommeil natif + Sleep as Android : la batterie tombe à 70% (avec ma Galaxy Watch 4 je suis entre 30 et 40% avec la même utilisation).Donc on peut tenir deux à trois jours avec une charge et on peut tenir encore plus car la montre permet de désactiver complétement Wear OS et de fonctionner sur un mode essentiel : seul l\'écran LCD est dispo (heure / date), le comptage de pas, le suivi de sommeil, mesure cardiaque, NFC (mode limité, pas de paiement), là normalement la montre tient plusieurs dizaine de jours (cependant je n\'ai pas testé). Ca peut être pratique. Dans mon cas je recharge la montre tous les jours pendant ma routine du matin (petit déj. et douche)Côté suivi santé ça me paraît très correct, en particulier le suivi de sommeil : les mesures sont comparables à ce dont j\'ai l\'habitude. J\'ai joint des captures d\'écran d\'une nuit avec le résultat du suivi natif de la montre. Pour un suivi de sommeil plus poussé, on peut très bien utiliser Sleep As Android qui fonctionne très bien avec la TicWatch, la différence majeur avec le suivi natif c\'est la détection de ronflement et des mesures plus fréquentes pour la saturation en Oxygène. Ayant des problèmes respiratoires je peux dire que les mesures effectuées par la montre reflètent parfaitement la gêne respiratoire que je peux avoir la nuit.A l\'usage dans la journée ce que j\'apprécie avec cette montre c\'est lorsqu\'une notification arrive sur mon téléphone, je n\'ai qu\'à lever le poignet et la montre l\'affiche directement.Elle dispose d\'un micro et haut parleur, et c\'est un plus sur une montre (le haut parleur) parce que ça sert énormément ne serait que pour les alarmes, et on peut aussi prendre et passer des appels directement sur la montre, ça s\'avère pratique dans certains circonstances (il manque tout de même un geste pour décrocher pour que ce soit au top)Le paiement sans contact avec Google Pay fonctionne très bien (si vous avez une banque qui supporte cette technologie, sinon faites comme moi, utilisez Lydia ;)).La montre est très légère, assez fine, agréable à porter (bracelet silicone), elle est en revanche très sobre et masculine, on peut l\'accessoiriser avec un autre bracelet (ils sont très facile à changer)En conclusion, pour le prix je pense que cette montre est une des meilleures montre Wear OS qu\'on puisse s\'offrir à ce jour.Note : comme sur toutes les montres Wear OS, Google Assistant ne fonctionne plus à 100%. Par exemple la détection de ""Ok, Google"" ne fonctionne plus, pour activer l\'assistant il faut soit passer par l\'écran, soit appuyer sur le bouton. C\'est dommage c\'est une fonction que j\'utilisais beaucoup en extérieur pour démarrer un minuteur par exemple. Certaines actions sont aussi impossibles voir difficile à faire, par exemple demander à Google Assistant d\'appeler un contact ne fonctionne pas, mais on peut appeler un numéro, etc... Ce n\'est malheureusement pas la faute de la TicWatch mais de la faute de Google, il ne reste plus qu\'à espérer que lors du passage à Wear OS version 3, l\'assistant fonctionne parfaitement. Sinon l\'assistant fonctionne encore parfaitement pour tout ce qui est domotique, mais il faut appuyer sur le bouton... Par exemple, je peux sans problème, ouvrir mon portail à partir de la montre, le retour vocal de l\'assistant est parfaitement fonctionnel, y compris lorsque l\'assistant me demande le code pour ouvrir le portail.', ""Leggendo altre recensioni ho notato che più di una persona ha avuto il mio stesso problema. Spiego.Dopo aver bagnato l'orologio in piscina, fuori dall'acqua ha iniziato a vibrare senza più smettere. A fatica sono riuscito a spegnerlo, e ho provato a fare l'hard reset ma senza risultato. Contattatato assistenza amazon che senza batter ciglio ha provveduto al rimborso completo dopo aver restituito l'orologio non più funzionante.Assistenza amazon una certezza voto 10/10Orologio mi ha deluso visto che è classificato e venduto come impermeabile resistente al nuoto.Voto 5/10"", ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Confesso di essere un amante di orologi, sia analogici che digitali, questi ultimi da quando mi è stato regalato, parecchi anni fa un bellissimo e ancora perfettamente funzionante “LG G Watch R”, penso fosse il primo con lo schermo “circolare” e Google Wear OS e da quel momento ho iniziato ad apprezzarli sempre di più.Ho diversi smartwatch che uso con regolarità, lo scorso anno, dopo aver regalato ad un amico il primo (penso) Ticwatch PRO, mi sono regalato il TicWatch PRO 2020 e devo dire che mi è piaciuto un sacco, poi sono passato ad uno stupendo Ticwatch PRO 3 LTE (che uso tutti i giorni) e visto che non mi accontento, ho approfittato di una promo Amazon e mi sono regalato quela nuova versione Ultra, in versione senza LTE.Le motivazioni che mi hanno spinto ad acquistarlo non risiedono tanto nella necessità di averne uno, quanto nella voglia di provare qualcosa di nuovo e conoscendo bene il marchio mobvoi sono andato a colpo sicuro!A differenza dei detrattori di Wear OS, ritengo che google abbia raggiunto un ottimo livello, sia in termini di usabilità sia in termini di applicazioni ed il fatto di avere su tutti gli smartwatch lo stesso sistema operativo lo trovo particolarmente comodo, in questo modo mi ritrovo su tutti gli orologi le stesse cose, le stesse applicazioni e lo stesso modo di funzionare, senza contare che non devo installare altre applicazioni, visto che basta quella standard di Google Wear OS.A parte questa, spero utile premessa, parto con la recensione di questo nuovo modello.La confezione è ben realizzata, anzi a dire il vero ogni prodotto mobvoi viene venduto con una confezione ben studiata (anche per il primissimo modello E1) e molto bella visivamente.La scatola, di colore bianco, contiene al suo interno lo smartwatch, il cavo di alimentazione con aggancio magnetico (manca anche qui l’alimentatore) ed un piccolo manuale di istruzioni (anche in italiano)La qualità dello smartwatch è notevole, partendo dal cinturino in gomma (anche se meno pregiato del modello adottato sulla versione LTE). Il cinturino è un modello standard da 22 mm con aggancio rapido tramite clip a molla. L’insieme è molto gradevole e sembra decisamente resistente, anche se forse avrei preferito un meccanismo di chiusura più evoluto in luogo della classica fibbia. Va detto che comunque è possibile sostituire il cinturino con altri modelli compatibili e risolvere il problema con pochi euro in più.Proseguendo, balza subito all’occhio lo schermo, decisamente grande e ben leggibile, anche in condizioni di luce intensa. La particolarità di questo modello (esattamente come per le versioni PRO precedenti) è la presenza di due display sovrapposti, uno AMOLED a colori ed uno LCD il tutto protetto da un vetro con trattamento antigraffio, sicuramente non paragonabile al vetro zaffiro utilizzato sui modelli di fascia alta ma comunque in grado di assicurare una buona protezione.Quando l’orologio non è utilizzato, il sistema disattiva lo schermo a colori ed attiva la versione LCD monocromatica che visualizza l’ora, la data, il numero di passi e lo stato della batteria, consumando però pochissima energia a tutto vantaggio della durata della batteria. La novità, rispetto alle versioni precedenti consiste nella retroilluminazione RGB (selezionabile tra un lungo elenco di colori possibili) del display LCD (quello normalmente attivo per risparmiare sulla batteria) che si attiva automaticamente al movimento del polso rendendo molto più facile leggere il contenuto in caso di illuminazione scarsa..Il display AMOLED è veramente impressionante, sia per la qualità dei colori che per il contrasto, senza trascurare la risoluzione molto alta che consente di rappresentare quadranti “quasi reali”.La scelta del quadrante da visualizzare può essere fatta direttamente dall’orologio (o anche dallo smartphone tramite l’applicazione Wear OS) selezionandolo tra uno dei tanti proposti da MobVoi o in alternativa installando applicazioni di terze parti, anche gratuite, in grado di simulare praticamente qualsiasi tipo di orologio esistente al mondo, penso che Wear OS ad oggi offra il maggior numero di sfondi o applicazioni al mondo.L’orologio presenta due pulsanti sul lato sinistro, il primo richiama il menu (o attiva l’assistenza vocale con una pressione prolungata) mentre il secondo può essere configurato per attivare una delle tante applicazioni installate. Nel mio caso a seconda della stagione sclego quale applicazione, d'inverno utilizzo l'applicazione SkiTrack mentre d'estate quella per le attività di MTB. Anche la pressione prolungata di questo secondo pulsante è personalizzabile così da incrementare le possibilità di utilizzo.Per quanto riguarda le altre caratteristiche hardware, questo smartwatch integra in particolare:1) 1 GB di memoria RAM e 8GB di memoria di storage2) Display LCD e AMOLED da 1,4 pollici (326 dpi)3) un sensore per la lettura del battito cardiaco (anche continuo) e tramite l’app Tic Salute o TicBattito è possibile monitorare i battiti e le anomalie H24, evidenziandole in appositi riquadri.4) Sensore NFC utilizzabile con GooglePay per pagare con carta di credito direttamente dallo smartwatch (veramente comodo)5) Sensore GPS (per tutte le applicazioni che lo richiedono) compatibile con GPS, GLONASS, Beidou e Galileo6) Un sensore per il controllo della saturazione dell’ossigeno (molto in voga in questo periodo di Covid-19)7) In ultimo, il nuovissimo processore Snapdragon Wear 4100 molto più performante e parco nei consumi e affiancato da un secondo processore mobvoi a bassissimo consumo.Oltre a questi c’è il contapassi e contacalorie, Accelerometro, giroscopio, sensore luce (già presenti nella versione precedente) a cui si aggiungono le funzionalità per il monitoraggio dello stress, del sonno, del rumore, ecc..Gli argomenti “Batteria” e “Durata” sono difficili da definire perché troppo influenzati dalla tipologia di utilizzo, dopo 2 giorni di utilizzo intenso il consumo della batteria è sceso al 60% (ma ci ho giocato davvero tanto) per cui direi che è assolutamente identico al modello PRO 3 LTE che utilizzo da quasi 2 anni.Certo questo non vuole essere un test rigoroso, ma dovrebbe dare l’idea del bassissimo consumo del display LCD monocromatico e del nuovo processore Qualcomm SnapDragon 4100.L’aspetto software è praticamente identico a tutti gli altri smartwatch con lo stesso sistema operativo e questo lo trovo fantastico, il mondo delle app sviluppate per il mondo Google Wear è praticamente infinito… si trova di tutto, personalmente ho installato su tutti i mie smartwatch Spotify (cosi da poter comandare la musica direttamente dall’orologio), Whatsapp, SkiTrack e tanti altri…L’insieme delle applicazioni preinstallate da TicWatch è decisamente completo e tutte orientate al monitoraggio della salute in tutti gli ambiti possibili. Tra le più importanti troviamo: TicSalute, TicEsercizio, TicBattico, TicSonno, TicRespiro, TicZen, TicOssigeno,TicAscolto, VoiceMemo.In alternativa alla versione GPS c'è il modello LTE che consente di usare l’orologio per telefonare (cosa che quasi fanno tutti), ma in modo autonomo, senza la necessità di avere un telefono collegato, sfruttando una Virtual SIM che in Italia è disponibile solo per il clienti Vodafone ed è per questo motivo che questa volta ho preso la versione GPS e non la LTE.Va sottolineato che questo modello presenta ben 1GB di memoria RAM (quella utilizzata per far girare i programmi) e 8GB di memoria ROM ed in effetti si sente la presenza, i programmi funzionano più velocemente rispetto ad altri smartwatch che invece hanno 512MB di memoria.In definitiva, pur avendo smartwatch nella mia collezione anche Smartwatch di marchi blasonati alla fine quelli che uso tutti i giorni sono i modelli di Mobvoi che ritengo essere tra i migliori smartwatch Google Wear presenti sul mercato.PRO- Design moderno- Leggerezza- Memoria ram da 1GB- Memoria ROM da 8GB- Processore Qualcomm SnapDragon 4100- Doppio display (con retroilluminazione a colori)- Durata della batteria- Cinturino da 22mm- Manuale in italianoCONTRO- Per il momento nulla da segnalareSpero che questa recensione vi sia stata utile.""]"

So I thought trying out a $40 watch might suit my needs better. Unfortunately, I will no longer be using the Andfz watch for the following reasons (pros will follow cons):- To see your message context on the watch, you must set your privacy settings to Show all notifications and sensitive content on the lock screen. Why have a lock screen in the first place then? I have always kept all notifications off my lock screen for productivity reasons and it really bothered me that my conversations and notifications could no longer be private or ignored.- If you don\'t clear your notifications, you will receive a vibration in the watch for every notification still present on your phone. For example, 4 different people have messaged me since I last opened my phone. Every time I receive a new text, my watch buzzes for each notification, regardless of the fact it already notified me. This causes a jumble of text on the watch screen that is a headache to try and parse. I ended up just ignoring the buzzes, which totally defeats the purpose of the watch AND made me miss several phone calls bc I thought they were just another 18,000 notification reminders.- Recently, my phone stopped connecting to WiFi. It would just toggle itself off anytime I turned it on. When I booted my phone in safe mode and began fooling around with the apps, I discovered the Andfz app was the culprit. It asks you to allow every single permission possible and somewhere in the setup, it decided to start controlling my WiFi. This resulted in Google Play updating all my apps over mobile data, even though I was in my own home supposedly on my own wifi, which then caused my data usage to skyrocket 100% more than normal in just one week. Lame.- This may be a me/settings problem, but everytime I would answer my phone, it would automatically send the audio through my watch... Even if it was in the other room charging, causing me to yell ""hello"" into my phone and hang up when I heard no response.- I have narcolepsy and rely heavily on sleep tracking. It would track my sleep maybe 4 out of 7 nights in a week.- Screen stopped lighting up when I turned my wrist, despite the sensitivity being turned all the way up.- You can receive notifications from most apps, but have to wait for a notification from an app to come through to turn them on/off. This left me constantly going into the watch settings and toggling off apps I had no desire to see on my watch.PROS:- If I managed my phone notifications well, I could read incoming messages (vs it just vibrating 40 times and scrolling through every message in whatever order it thought made sense)- My dog could be my watch face (this is a common feature on most smart watches)- It\'s $40...- Whenever I told it I was on my period, it would remind me to change my hygiene products every 8 hours. Cute, maybe helpful to young girls who are just starting their brave journey into womanhood, but mostly just weird and funny.- My 41mm watch band from my Galaxy Watch fit the Andfz watch, so I could maintain my vibe or whatever.- Pretty basic easy-to-use controls- Charges pretty quickly and the battery life is close to a week.- When I did use the watch as a speakerphone of sorts, I never got complaints about the way I sounded to the other caller and the sound quality of the call was pretty decent.Overall, if you don\'t care about the possibility of the watch app sneakily taking over your phone and using all your data and you need to be reminded to change your sanitary napkins every 8 hours, this watch is for you. Otherwise, wait 6 months for the new Samsung/Pixel/Apple watch to drop, buy the year prior\'s version refurbished (if you wanna save money), and know that whatever feature you\'re bummed it doesn\'t have now will be standard in the next version.Mazel tov', ""This is my first smartwatch. I wanted an Apple watch but i didn't want to spend the money. I just needed something to track my steps, show my messages, take a call...track my sleep patterns. I found this watch after much searching and research. First of all the watch fits nicely. The screen is big and easy to read. The watch band is made from soft silicone and it is comfortable. It paired right away with my iPhone 8. No issue whatsoever.  You can take calls from your watch, and you can ready text messages, however, you can't reply to texts... but you can make a call! I also like the different faces that you can download from the website. I also like that you can add your own. Again, very simple to use. I promise if you are looking for something simple  and easy to use, and won't break the bank, this is your watch!  The blood pressure was an added bonus for me plus the blood oxygen levels. Overall, without going into a lot of details, I loved this watch. It is a great buy and comes with so many helpful details. SmartWatches have come a long way, nowadays, you can get one for under $100."", ""I dislike that it does NOT track day sleep.  So no matter what anyone says, if you need to track unconventional sleep, don't bother.Otherwise,  the watch is good."", 'However I lost the charger and cannot find one for a reasonable price.', 'I bought this for my bf who has high blood pressure. He has been wearing it for 2 weeks now and loves it! It tracks his bp every 30 min and hourly throughout the day and night along with heart rate, sleep, blood oxygen, steps plus so much more.. The phone feature works great for texting but phone calls are not that crisp or clear. He’s not that interested in that feature so no big deal.Battery lasts about 4 days and set up was super easy with the app. Band is very comfortable and soft to the touch. Doesn’t feel or look like cheap plastic.I own the much more expensive type watch and had been waiting too long for them to include the bp feature. Well, thank you! We got exactly what we were looking for at a fraction of the price. I highly recommend and very happy w this product! Do yourself or loved one a big favor and don’t wait another second researching others. This is it!', ""I wore this watch for over a month to really get a chance to evaluate it over time.  As a watch goes, there are several pluses.  First in regards to accuracy, it's synchronized to Internet time, so very accurate.  Second, battery life.  My experience is I'm getting much better than it's advertised battery life between charges.  I've been going an average of 4 days in between charges.  Battery life is a definite plus.  Third, accuracy of blood pressure readings is surprisingly accurate.  It was well in line with blood pressure readings taken by medically trained people.  I bought my daughter the same watch and she just got released from the hospital following surgery and her readings were also in line with the hospital blood pressure readings.  So if keeping tabs on your blood pressure is important for you, this is another big plus.  The heartbeat app is fairly accurate.  Fourth, the price point for this watch is very reasonable.  But not all the features on this watch are as good.  The step counter is highly suspect, based on my experience.  It has recorded steps while I'm asleep, and when I'm sitting down working at desk, it has on occasion recorded steps.  I suspect this may be due to hand movements while sitting at a desk and also during sleep.  The sleep tracker is also highly suspect.  It's tracked sleep when I'm fully awake but in a relaxed state.  I have little confidence in the temperature tracker as it is consistently a couple of degrees off.  But by far it's most serious drawback is the call/talk function.  It took me some time to figure out the way to turn off that function entirely - which I highly recommend.  Go to the settings and touch the telephone icon and it turns off this function without disabling the Bluetooth capability.  There was a certain novelty in hearing a phone conversation on my watch, and I was highly amused by this the first couple of times.  The novelty wore off FAST!  Before I found the trick of disabling the phone icon, I couldn't hear the conversation on my smartphone - which is by far my preferred way of holding a conversations.  My first solution was to disable the Bluetooth capability, but that interfered with other functions.  If you want to talk on the watch (why?), you'll find it has many limitations and the quality of the sound is off.  I highly recommend disabling this functionality.  As far as the instructions that come with the watch go - Good luck!  The instructions are poorly written by someone not fluent in English.  My biggest complaint is the lack of response by the customer service people for this product.  My daughter misplaced the charging chord on her phone for a couple of days.  I decided to order replacements just in case.  I contacted the seller requesting either the type of replacement chord that would work with their phone or if there was a way to order a replacement through them.  I did this a week ago and NO RESPONSE.  Put in a second request - again, no response.  The charging chord replacement products offered on Amazon come with a warning they will not work on all smartwatches.  I did order one that I hope will work, but it is due to arrive in another day, so I can't speak to if it works or not.  But this is a MAJOR PROBLEM for consumers.  It's fairly easy to misplace this chord.  Without it, your watch is useless.  It is for this reason - the poor customer service of the seller, that I cannot recommend this smartwatch.  Had they responded to either of my two requests, I'd have given it 4 stars even with the questionable accuracy of some of the trackers."", 'I already have a budget-friendly smart watch that I’m rather pleased with but decided to give this one a try because it was a flash deal and had the added feature of BP monitoring. Shipping was quick and, upon receipt, I was pleased with the esthetics- packaging and actual product appearance.  After fully charging and downloading the associated app, it was trial time.My assessment follows:1. The band is made of some type of thick, stiff rubber that does not allow much airflow resulting an in itchy, irritated, sweaty wrist. This happened despite trying to leave breathing space between my wrist and the watch so wearing it all night to track sleep was out of the question.2. The speaker is loud enough but is oddly positioned on the right side of the watch. Any movement of my wrist caused the sound to become muffled. On my other watch the speaker is on the left so it is never affected by wrist motion.. However, I do appreciate the ability of being able to control the music player’s volume directly from the watch- a feature missing on the one I already own.3. Both the pre installed watch faces as well as the options available online were rather basic and unattractive. There is an option to upload personal photos to use as watch faces which is somewhat redeeming. This has to be done via the companion app.4. Receiving notifications was seamless and the ability to use the Voice Assistant feature to respond to messages was a plus. Tapping Voice Assistant and speaking a command opens Siri on iPhone without having to say, “hey, Siri.” The request is completed via the phone not the watch and all audio is transmitted through the watch. In my opinion, this is a nice hands free perk.5. I was surprised to see that the training options were so limited, even omitting yoga and dance- two of my favorite activities.I will close out my assessment with the absolute dealbreaker for this “smart watch.” I’m sure most people, myself included, are in the market for a smart watch mainly for the health monitoring. If that’s the case, this is NOT the watch for you! When setting up the app, it prompts you to choose the color that is closest to your skin tone. The explanation being so the watch will be able to provide a more accurate reading for heart rate, blood oxygen and blood pressure. While the hr and oxygen readings seemed fairly accurate, the blood pressure feature I was most excited about was grossly INACCURATE and seemingly just a preset number. The initial reading was 126/84. far from my normal 110/60 when taken with an actual blood pressure cuff. This is what caused me to become suspicious. I subsequently decided to conduct a series of tests. I placed this watch in random places on my body: bottom of my foot, top of my knee and directly over my tibia. Each time it gave the same 126/84 reading. I then decided to place it on my 14 year old daughter’s wrist. Guess what? According to this device her blood pressure too was….126/84.This revelation really piqued my curiosity so I decided to go back into the app and adjust the skin tone to a fairer setting. Retaking BP in the same manner previously mentioned. This resulted in readings of 112/64 no matter where the watch was placed or who was wearing it. Unfortunately, it didn’t cross my mind to set the skin tone to a darker setting and repeat the process.That was all I needed to solidify my decision to return to sender. Packed this thing up and shipping it back to Amazon today. Don’t waste your time with this one.', ""The display screen is sharp, the wristband is soft. The app overall, is nicely organized. notification buzz isn't that great. The Changing the screen display works and doesn't work. Speaker clarity is good, the loudness is alright, would be nice if it was slightly louder. Weather report is great, the heart rate, blood oxygen stress, it's very good. Overall it's a decent smartwatch"", 'Love the watch . Really nice and well made. I did not receive my watch cover though . It said one would be included.', 'I love this watch! I have had this watch for about 3 weeks now and I love everything about it! I especially love that it can track my sleep and deep sleep! The blue tooth works really well and the speaker volume on the watch itself is the perfect volume to listen to my music. You can make calls and get your notifications on here from text to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and more! I love the band color and there’s different little backgrounds and I found the perfect one for me! It has good battery life, charges relatively fast. I definitely recommend this watch!UPDATE:I forgot to take my watch off before I got into the shower and panicked when I realized that I had it on. This watch was drenched but low and behold it held up and still works like a champ!! If you’re thinking about buying a smart watch look no further!!']"

I had lots of previous experience with the agar in chest strap and the Wahoo arm band so I can compare my experience with those products.The Coospo immediately connected via Bluetooth with no need to attempt it multiple times. Battery time was advertised at 18 hours but I can attest to 10 hours on some longer rides.From June to late August this heart rate monitor was so dependable I just tended to forget about past challenges with other finicky monitors when the decide suddenly stopped working. I would press the connect button and would just see the red LED flash at me. My guess was either it stopped charging or just wasn’t connecting anymore.I contacted Coospo literally yesterday and after a few emails back and forth the company seemed as baffled as I about why it stopped working. Without any argument, Coospo asked if I would like a refund or a replacement device. I had such good luck with the device initially that I chose a replacement. The folks at Coospo asked me to video the setup and some of the initial uses this time around so they could monitor it. That also gave me some peace of mind.Sure - I could have rated them lower because the device quit working but the true test of a good product and company is that when something breaks they fix it - outside the 30 warranty period.  I am pretty confident the first failure is just a fluke and am willing to match the positive support from Coospo with faith from my end.', 'I use this heart monitor while riding bicycle inside with my Rouvy app. Nice to be able to see real-time hear rate rather than using my oximeter. I test the heart monitor arm band against the oximeter and a fitness watch. They all record the same rate within 1 bpm.The downside: I have not seen an indicator of battery strength. I may have missed something in the instructions. I was disappointed when the battery was dead when I wanted to ride. Recharging is quick. Some battery strength indicator would be good (or educate the user on battery strength).', 'I originally purchased this item due to my frustration with using my Apple watch connection when running in the Zwift program. The Apple watch connectivity was very spotty and inconsistent. I was tired of being ready to run and then having to spend time troubleshooting the watch to get the heart rate working. Once I charged the heart rate monitor it was ready to go. When I started Zwift it connected immediately and showed my heart rate. It stayed connected and has behaved similarly on subsequent runs. It is lightweight and easy to put on and take off. In my opinion much easier to put on than a chest strap monitor. I cannot comment on battery life at this point since I have not had to recharge it yet. However the device does alert you when the battery is low. If that is an issue I will edit this review to update', ""After a couple of months, the unit died and wouldn't charge, BUT their customer support team was right on it. Seeing my initial one-star review, they immediately contacted me and sent me a new unit.I was so impressed. Just by pointing this out in a review here, not even sending them a message, they immediately got a hold of me and took care of the issue.I am a longtime Amazon shopper and don't think I've ever had that faster resolution or that level of excellent support, especially for a lower-priced item.Kudos to their support team!"", ""I bought the 807 for low HR/MAF/zone 2 running and after a slight learning curve, I'm finding it useful, reliable, and a good value.I've found the best place to wear it is on my upper forearm near my elbow where it stays put without having to tighten the band too much.I use it with Mapmyrun on my phone, and the Coospo seems responsive to my changes in effort with little or no lag in updating my heart rate. I tested it against a finger pulse oximeter and my resting pulse readings were within a beat of each other.The app automatically calculates HR zones based on a max heart rate that you select. This allows me to set the max HR where the LED changes from green to yellow at my MAF HR and I can ease up if the LED turns yellow. I have no problem seeing the LED in most outdoor conditions, but on a very bright noon-time run I needed to shade the LED with my free hand to see it.Battery life is good for my needs. I usually run for an hour or two at a time 5 or 6 days per week and I charge the device less than once a week. On my last run, the battery went from 46 to 34 percent in 2 hours.There are a few features that could be improved to get a full 5 star rating:1 - the app would be better if you could define your own zones.  The app generates zones between ~14 to ~20 bpm wide, whereas I would rather have my target zone be 10bpm or sometimes only 5bpm wide. Also, the app is a little creepy in that you need to register via email but it does synch your preferences and history over multiple devices.2 - the LED flashes too slowly, so if I'm running along and want to glance at the color, it can take 5 strides of staring at the device before the LED lights up. I would rather just glance for half a second than have to stare and wait- especially when trail running.3 - the green and yellow LED are very similar in color so they can be a bit hard to distinguish, but over time I think I'm getting better at telling them apart. The yellow looks more like a paler green to me.I think items 1 and 2 could be fixed with app and firmware updates. If Coospo fixes them, I'm happy to come back and revise the rating to 5 stars.Thanks for reading and happy exercising!"", 'Bought two of these for myself and my wife to use with Zwift when riding on our bike trainers.  Perform flawlessly and have had no connection issues while using.  We especially like the led color indication of what heart rate zone you are in.  Instead of having to read a hear rate on the Zwift app a quick glance at the monitor lets me know how I am doing.', 'Initially, there was difficulty holding the heart rate while using Zwift.  I reached out to the company who was responsive and helpful. Although I cannot comment on the long term reliability, I’m happy with this purchase.', ""I work out at a fitness center and I regularly use their treadmills. They can connect to a heart rate monitor and adjust their incline based on heart rate. I got tired of holding onto the hand grips, so I got this to keep my heart rate steady at around 150 - 155 using auto incline adjustment. It does it job.Pros:+ Color codes are a quick visual reference when you're not using the treadmill and you need to avoid dying while running.+ Connects to life fitness treadmills just fine+ Water resistant. I sweat all over this thing and it stays in place.Cons:- Color codes only give you a reference to a heart rate range. Close enough tho.- Has a hard time connecting to my phone app. Not a huge deal for me, but it might be for someone else.- I would rather this be a USB c charger instead of a  magnetic, two prong charger. I understand why it's not tho.Other thoughts:I'm a military member and use their life fitness treadmills. This Works like a champ."", ""This arm-based HRM replaced an ancient Wahoo chest strap HRM that was on its last legs.  The old one only supported the Ant+ standard and therefore didn't work with Wahoo X.  The old one connected to my Wahoo Elemnt bike computer just fine, but the Wahoo X app on my iPad did not register it since the iPad works through BT, and I was not going to invest in a BT dongle for an HRM that was clearly on its way out.Also, the chest strap solution was not the most convenient.  I found myself forgetting to put it on, and discovering that fact only after I was on the bike.  Also, you had to remember to wet the contact points, otherwise results would not register.  So, it was time for an upgrade.I was going to spring on the extra $20 for the Wahoo Tickr arm solution, but this one seemed more cost-effective, and it didn't seem that I was going to lose anything.  It was very easy to get going with it - charged it up, and then connected through BT to the Wahoo app on my iPhone.  When I went to connect it to the iPad, it did not register.  I had to disconnect from the iPhone to have it recognized by the iPad.  Also, it did not register with the Elemnt initially.  After some trial and error - not sure what combination worked - I got it to work with the Elemnt concurrently.During my first ride however, the iPad maintained connectivity, while the Elemnt lost it and finally turned off in the middle of the ride.  I will continue to work with it to see if I can resolve the issue, but, for now, it is still a mystery - probably user error, but that remains to be seen.Overall, the Coospo is an excellent solution.  It was easy to put on, and did not require electrode wetting.  My heart rate showed up almost immediately, and seemed to be very accurate - I compared it to my Apple watch at various points in the ride, and it appeared very accurate.

‎B09B2XYTWC,"Fossil Gen 6 42mm Touchscreen Smartwatch with Alexa Built-In, Heart Rate, Blood Oxygen, Activity Tracking, GPS, Speaker, Smartphone Notifications, Rose Gold/Purple, Modern",Smartwatches,S$329.72,https://www.amazon.sg/Fossil-Touchscreen-Smartwatch-Smartphone-Notifications/dp/B09B2XYTWC/ref=sr_1_338?qid=1695864534&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051%2Cp_72%3A6469119051%2Cp_36%3A10000-90000&rnid=6450031051&s=electronics&sr=1-338,https://www.amazon.sg/Fossil-Touchscreen-Smartwatch-Smartphone-Notifications/product-reviews/B09B2XYTWC/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,4.3,"['I read most of the Amazon reviews for the Samsung, Garmin and Fossil smartwatches before buying this one.Style: I needed a watch that I could wear from workout, through work, to evening if needed and though the rhinestone bezel is a bit blingy for the gym - who cares?  It\'s the gym.  I find that the watch is understated enough to go to the dog park or gym - with the leather band, but with a change of face can be transformed for a dinner out.  For those who never explored the Facer App, or thought you had to subscribe to download all these faces, this is incorrect.  You just need to patiently clear the Ad that comes up after you choose each watch face to add to your Watchbox (at the bottom of the Facer App main screen)  All watch faces that you ""I heart""  will load to your Watchbox you can then easily select to load to your watch.  There are thousands of choices that are free, only the Premium faces need a subscription.  I found a favorite Facer watch face designer, Warren Silberstein, who has hundreds of faces he designed, many of those I shared here are his - everything from antique, to classic, to florals, elegant, fun, even custom watch faces.  If you ""follow"" any watch designer you like you can get notification when they release a new one.  You can store up to 4 faces from the Facer app directly on your watch.  If you ever want to switch any of them out, just go into your Watchbox, select the ""Free"" button and it will download it from Facer to your watch.  This will push out the oldest used watch face, so you will always have 4 faces available.Band: I can\'t wear silicone on my wrist, and prefer leather so it didn\'t matter that the watch came with a rose gold metal band as I was going to remove it - I wouldn\'t work out with a metal band.  Right now the Rose Gold metal band version of the Gen 6 is $100 less than the silicone band version, so if you don\'t mind supplying your own band, it is a great buy.  You will see in my photos that the band comes with 2 quick release pins on each side you simple squeeze and it releases from the watch.  I purchased a black croc textured 18mm leather band from Amazon for $14, that came with a band replacement tool and extra pins.  It took me a minute to pop them both in after watching a YouTube video on how to use the tool.Setup:  Right out of the box, they recommend you charge it which I did.  It walked me through the setup which went smoothly.  Initially, to test out all the installed apps, I recommend that you give permissions to all the apps initially.  Test the Apps that are factory installed, and if you don\'t like them or the corresponding phone interface like the Cardiogram App, you can just uninstall it on your phone and the watch.  For example, the Cardiogram App requires a monthly or annual subscription so I deleted it and opted to use the Heart Rate in Google Fit.Apps:  This current 2023 Gen 6 version comes with Wear OS3 installed but for the time being Google Assistant is not functioning, so you have to use Amazon Alexa for  voice interface, but Fossil has indicated they are working on it.  It was formerly fully functioning in Wear OS2.  Personally, I don\'t often use a voice interface, but have found it helpful to tell Alexa to text someone for me while I am driving and it has worked flawlessly.  When a future Fossil watch update releases a functioning Google Assistant, I will probably uninstall Alexa and use the Google Assistant for simplicity sake.  The Fossil App is factory installed and comes with a basic Wellness App.  The Sleep App worked perfectly in the Wellness App, but my Heart Rate monitor was not functioning despite all the online help, troubleshooting efforts and YouTube tutorials.  The Heart Rate would show up on the menu page, eg. Heart Rate 72, but when you touch ""Heart Rate"", it would scroll right to the live heart rate tile and it would be flatlined at 000 and would not move.  When I would scroll up to see the Heart Rate activity log to see if it was tracking at intervals (I had given the watch permission to track a continuous heart rate), the screen would flicker.  I reached out to Fossil, got a human being on the first attempt, explained all I had done to troubleshoot the watch and the rep escalated it to their Tech Team.  The agent said they would email me within 48 hours.  In fact, they did email me the very next day and asked me to Factory Reset the watch.  I did so and now the Heart Rate monitor is working perfectly.  I will say that this was specifically a Wellness app issue as the Google Fit app I downloaded reported the Heart Rate regularly and accurately.  I used my PulseOximeter to compare my O2 sats and heart rate and they were almost always spot on - I mean within one point or so and this could simply be a result of the timing of each measurement.  I prefer to use the Google Fit app for step tracking and workouts as they have an extensive list of exercise types you can track.  In contrast, the Wellness app only tracks one activity, so it is very basic but if you prefer simplicity, you might prefer the Wellness App and not download Google Fit to save space on your watch.  I do like that I can see the live heart rate in the Wellness app.  Google Fit does not have that feature.  If I need more storage space in the future on the watch I would  uninstall the Wellness app if possible and keep Google Fit.  As Wellness is factory installed, I do not know at this time if it is possible.  Another app I don\'t have any need for is the Fossil app.  It offers a dozen or so watch faces which were not what I was looking for.  I much prefer the Facer App and in fact the diversity that Facer offers without my having to pay for a subscription is a real plus.  (I know the game ads are annoying, but once you\'ve got your preferred watch faces in your Watchbox, your\'e  all done, unless you want to go shopping for more in the future.)  The Fossil App is more marketing than functional, and offers little technical help, so I don\'t see the need for it on the watch.  I don\'t use the Fossil watch faces and would like to be able to delete them but as they are Factory installed, as of this writing, I do not know if it is possible.Pressing the crown of the watch allows you to access the watch face and another push brings up your apps.  In Wear OS2, they scrolled in a circular fashion following the curve of the watch face as you turned the crown or scrolled through them on the touchscreen, but on this Gen 6 version with Wear OS3, the App Menu scrolls vertically, like the settings menu.  I prefer the circular scrolling look as you will see on some older Gen 6 watches running WearOS2 (check out YouTube tutorials for a pictorial example).  I am hoping when they get Google Assistant working in Wear OS3 for Fossil that they will also re-instate the circular scrolling app menu style.Texts, Calls and Speaker:  I get my messages and calls on the watch and can easily answer them via voice so I don\'t have to type on the very tiny keypad provided.  You can opt to answer calls on your watch or phone in the settings.  I also like that you can download music from my YouTube library, then bluetooth my earbuds to the phone and walk in the park without my phone.  I have had no trouble bluetooth connecting my ear buds to the watch.Battery Life:  It does charge in 30 minutes, but initially when you are downloading new apps and deleting others, or playing with the Facer App and downloading dozens of faces to try, it will use up battery life, so don\'t be concerned about this initial drain and need to recharge.  Once I filled up my Watchbox using the free Facer app, I turned off settings that drain battery like continuous watch face on, continuous O2 sats or heart rate.  I periodically check heart rate and O2 throughout the day for health reasons, but when I workout, I change the setting to continuous as I am preparing to workout.  While I shower at night, I put the watch on the charger so I go to sleep with 100%.  I monitor sleep, O2 and heart rate at night and wake up with 95% battery.  While I am getting ready for the day in the morning, I top off the charge if I remember.  After a several mile walk, grocery shopping, admin work, by mid-afternoon, I am around 85%.  I have gone to sleep without charging it while it monitored my night stats and I woke up the next morning with 70%.  I  had a 5 year old Huawei sports watch that finally died and I was accustomed to charging it at night as I didn\'t wear it for sleep, but the Fossil as I use it now with tracking a daily workout, steps, texting, calls and my night stats has gone for 2 days without a charge.  The need to charge every 2 days is not an issue for me as I don\'t wear my watch in the shower, so I can just put it on the charger and its good to go for the night to track my sleep, O2 and heart.  I understand if you have been an Apple watch user and are used to going a week without charging, that you may have an expectation to do the same here, and be utterly disappointed, but do you really shower with your watch on?  I have rapid charger boxes and this watch charges so fast, I have never had an issue with it losing power when I needed it.To conclude - it\'s a beautiful as well as functional watch.  I am really loving exploring the Facer App and the different artists.  But I appreciate that all of its health functions are helping me monitor my dog walks, workouts and health.  I don\'t think that the delay in providing the Voice Assistant is enough to merit delaying saving $100 on this watch.  They will provide an OS3 update when it is ready.  In the meantime I have been using Alexa and she is doing all the things I was able to do with Voice Assistant.  I appreciate that Fossil got back to me so quickly to help me do the reset and reinstall the Heart Monitor app.  All is working perfectly now and I am getting into my daily rhythm with it.  I understand everyone\'s needs are different, but hope this review has helped anyone thinking about this watch.', 'I have a lot to say, I also tested the battery...... I\'m not a watch person, but Im trying to get organized and avoid having my huge smartphone in my hands most of the time, I was worried that the screen was gonna a look too big on my thin wrist, but it\'s not, smartwatches aren\'t tiny anyways, I was tired of the smartwatches that looked square, all of them looked equal, so I was looking for a nicer design, loved it. I also really wanted to have alexa assistant, because I use many alexa products, worked great, just make sure you speak clearly, I used all the apps, tried them, good making calls, texting, reminders, messages, all notifications, it sync completely and it never disconnect, amazing, you can even play games in it, simple games but it kills time, I wasn\'t expecting that, the resolution is very good, used the GPS while driving. I have been wearing it every day, and tried the different battery modes, and what I noticed the most is that the display options made a big difference, I always use smart battery life option because I never use like 100% of all the fitness options because I\'m not regular/daily at gym or exercise, but I do exercise, also the amount of notifications may help on battery life, it\'s better to turn off from the phone the unnecessary notifications that you don\'t even want to see when you\'re using your phone, in general, if you use the full battery for all functions it will last less than 12 or 10 hours, if you use smart battery it will last the whole day and more, if you reduce the display time it will last 2 days, using it only with Bluetooth, and it works as good as wifi, using wifi reduces battery life, wifi could be used if you\'re phone is dead or you\'re too far from your phone. The charger is amazing, I wasn\'t expecting that, that like a plus and balances the lack of battery life, i usually take a break of using watches or anything in my wrist and hands, so it doesn\'t bother me taking it off and leave it 15 or 30 minutes for a full charge, I don\'t like to sleep with anything on, if I forget to take it off and sleep I let it track my sleep, it\'s very detailed, I use ""do not disturb"" on my phone and watch to sleep peacefully, I have it automatically with hours set, that also makes a long battery life, so for me it works just fine. I knew this smartwatch had low battery life, I read all the reviews before buying it and I knew there were ways to extend battery, and I didn\'t want to buy other options, this one does everything I want in a smartwatch even if I have to charge it once every 2 days and that doesn\'t bother me. Not only has alexa, it has Google assistant too, I didn\'t do the upgrade of wear OS 3, assistants works great, and I\'m having no issues. And I put 4 stars just for the battery life, this product is literally almost perfect and it looks very elegant, I love it.', 'I wanted to love this watch immediately. Didn’t happen. I’m learning to live with it. My older Fossil smartwatch was so easy! I don’t need all the tech savvy things this watch offers. The battery doesn’t last that long. But, I’m warming up to it. It’s very good looking. I did get a black leather band. The silicone wasn’t what I wanted. The good thing is—IT TELLS THE TIME 😁', 'I am a pebble user and it is really hard to compare a pebble to a smart watch. but since there is no alternative, I decided to give fossil a try.Since it is my first smart watch, I don\'t know if it is fossil specific or ware os specific.- Sleep tracking was better with pebble.- Size wise and batter life - can\'t beat pebble - small and batter lasts a week.- With this watch, it attempts to do always on display, it mostly succeeds, but still I have to fight with it to show me the time clearly, especially when outdoor in the sun, and it does not always work as I would expect it.- Notifications on the messages I recieve - I don\'t get it. Sometimes it just fails to connect to the phone and it would not show me messages. Sometimes it would only show me messages from one texting app, but not another. Also - It does not keep all the messages on the watch. Very confusing. Shows only last one. Inconvenient.- The watch itself is really pretty. Once I got facer enabled, I was able to find a watch face that would show me more than 2 default data sets that the default face shows (why?? to encourage people to get facer and spend money? - why can\'t you show hearbeat, steps and batter life on one screen? together with the current time and date and day of the week - aren\'t you a smart watch?).So - it is ok... but I don\'t know if my complains appy to any smart watch that is based ware OS or fossil specific.I want to like it. I like it. I got myself 3 chargers, so I can charge it whenever. But it is far from ideal and can\'t beat pebble sadly. I wish people manifacture pebble and not those annoying stupid bulky ""smart"" watches.', ""I bought it for my wife and she loved it, it's pretty and easy to use"", 'I love the color and the fact it is round. I had to remove some links because my wrist is really small. Face is a bit large but workable. It does heart rate and monitors steps and breathing. Not completely accurate compared to heart rate monitor, but close. It stays charged for approximately 10 hours and then you have to recharge. Has lightning fast charge, 30-50 min max to charge. Wish it would stay charged longer like other watches I’ve seen. Does have options for different face backgrounds.', 'Buen material, bonito, bien empacado', ""I loved this watch until I updated it. The Fossil Smartwatch app is awful! When I emailed customer service it took NINE emails back and forth to address the questions I had. I finally gave up. Fossil should have left things alone or allowed us the option to continue to use Google Wear. After the update it took an act of Congress to talk on my watch when on a phone call, to set notifications I receive on the watch, and I still haven't figured out how to get my watch to show my step count. If I were to rate customer service, I'd give it one star. The watch is beautiful. The watcfaces are very nice also. The Fossil Smartwatch App is not impressive."", 'Cumple con las especificacioes por las cuales lo compre', ""The Fossil Gen 6 42mm Touchscreen Smartwatch is a fantastic smartwatch that combines convenience, functionality, and style.

I got burned trying to buy this cheaper from a Facebook ad. Needless to say, I lost my money. Ordered it here (paid a little more, but worth it) and got it in 2 days.This is my first day wearing the watch, but I did learn some key things. First of all, charge it 100% before doing anything with it. Then once you get the app downloaded and the watch is connected to your phone, go to the app and download the latest firmware update. Before I did this the battery life was dropping. I updated the firmware and it stopped.Next, I’m a music lover and was eager to download all my songs to my watch….uhhhh NOPE! See that 128mb (NOT 128G like they lied & said on Facebook) is not extra “free” memory. That’s the capacity of the whole watch. So technically you really have 14mb free space which for me was only 8 songs. Don’t even bother. Just connect the earbuds & listen to the songs on your PHONE. The earbuds sound great by the way. I love that they conveniently fit in the watch.As far as texts & app notifications, everything popped up on my watch. HOWEVER, if it’s a long text/message, you cannot scroll to read it all. It cuts the message off at a certain point. Also, there’s no feature that allows you to answer the text message on your phone. Big as it is, that should’ve been possible.It does measure steps, calories, blood pressure, temperature etc. just like the listing says. The accuracy of these measurements are yet to be determined. I have an iPhone, and although the app to the watch is connected to Apple Health, they came up with 2 different step counts. Granted, I didn’t have my phone on me the whole time today, so that may be why.Overall I sill love the watch. The dial faces available in the app are nice looking and colorful, and I love the customize watch face option. Just a couple of little things I wish the designers could’ve gotten right.Plus, it’s WAY CHEAPER than an Apple Watch!!! I was going cross-eyed looking at that little 38mm screen, and wanted a bigger screen, but I DIDN’T want the bigger price for the 42mm. This watch face is huge and very easy to read. I will keep wearing it to see if the accuracy of the measurements adjust themselves (someone on here said they would). I’ll post an update at a later time about anything else I discover.', ""Pros:- earbuds lasted about 4 hours per charger- sound quality for earbuds is pretty good and I think most people will enjoy them- battery can easily last 4-5 days if not longer depending on earbud usage- external speaker is pretty loud and decent quality. Youll still probably use your phones speaker or an external bluetooth speaker most of the time but its a nice option to have if you want it.Cons:- Size. I have a large wrist and the watch looked fine on me but those with smaller wrists will find it to be quite bulky- super basic, no nfc payment, google assistant, etc. Really only useful as a earbud holder that tells time- text notifications only work when the phone app is open and even then it only worked for me 70% of the time- If your earbuds are connected to your phone you cant pause, skip, etc your music with the watch. The only time you can control your phones music with the watch is if you're using the external speaker. If you use the earbuds with the watch then you can only listen to and control music thats downloaded on the watch which can only hold a few songs.- Price. This watch isnt that expensive but I was able to get an open box galaxy watch 4 classic that looks brand new with a 1 year warranty on ebay for only a little bit more than this watch and it has way more features that are well  worth giving up the built in earbuds forOverall its an ok watch but the built in earbuds are just a fun gimmick that wears off quickly and makes you want a better watch with more features like nfc, google assistanc, etc. If this is your first smart watch I'd recommend trying it for a week or two to see if you like wearing watches and to get a feel for what features you'd like from your watch then returning it and getting a different watch that has the features you want."", 'I owned the Samsung version and I like this one better. It more functional for me. And works with my ipad & car system too.', 'I am very impressed. Considering the cost and functionality its great value for the money. What prompted me to write this. Its been 7 day since last charge its still over half charge. Try that with your samsung or apple.', ""Liked the concept and worked good for a few months.The ear pieces are comfortable and has good sound and sound canceling.The charging ports though started to coroid within a month of getting it and one of the prongs corroded completed away on less than 3 months. And now the only ear piece that works is getting hot when it charges and I'm not going to be able to use it any more."", 'It says that is waterproof but only to the rain not the shower I wore it 3 times my watch is not working now I wish I had a warrenty on this watch my son loves his watch', ""We were looking for a smart watch that had earbuds, because we listen to a lot of audio while we're working, these are great, more features than I expected for the price. The watch dose use an app to fully connect to your phone. The app is easy to use and you can even upload your own backgrounds, making it easier to personalize. The speaker in the watch is louder than I thought it would be, though sometime crackles depending on what I'm listing to. The only complaint that I have is, to get access to the message notifications I have to have the other apps selected. It would be nice to be able to select the individual apps. When I'm listing to music it sends a message to the watch every time the song changes,  little annoying and would like to turn it off but can't. Othere than that not a deal breaker. Would recommend 100%."", ""I enjoyed using this watch for a while-- having earbuds on the go is convenient and the style suited me well. But after I let the battery die once, I've had nothing but trouble with getting this device to charge again.Part of the problem is, the charger itself is poorly designed. It's magnetic to the inside bottom of the device, rather than being inserted. However, these magnets are relatively weak and do not keep the watch from slipping off the charger even when it's not being moved-- and it has to be on PERFECTLY, or no charge goes through.I would not recommend this watch to others. Get a cheaper option with better reviews-- there are like five of them."", ""I got it for the headphone features, which were really appealing on top of it being a smartwatch, but I pretty soon found out that I couldn't use the headphones on the device with the phone itself, but the device was capable of using its speaker to play sound for the device. I then assumed it wouldn't be a big deal, then loaded some songs on it so I could at least listen to music. But when I did it, it just played low-pitched & slowed down versions of all the songs, not to mention it was extremely choppy, and this was on the first use. While I do still want a smartwatch, I'm going to be returning this one, as the features I got it for just didn't work for me. two stars cause everything else works fine, just not the main reason of obtaining."", 'After having them for a bit I find that the short coming wasn’t from watch but compatibility with apple but for the most part a better alternative to AirPods']"

The Celsius and Fahrenheit settings, you can indeed change them and also meters to feet but not on watch you have to change those in the app on your phone VBand.2. The sound quality of watch and ear buds, is amazing, music sounds great but indeed the driver for music is not awesome so you do hear a form of slow down sometimes, not that bad, otherwise amazing sound from watch and buds.3. I would say like any watch that takes any form of readings, its accurate to a point, and I  find it can be off by a few points, 1 or 2 here or there, BP, Pulse, etc, read fairly close to correct not medical grade, go figure it was 50 bucks lol.4. Phone works good, connection can be a bit wonky at times and depending on that the sound can be rough, but its just like if you were out of range using cell phone, a bit choppy, the better the connection the better the call will be. When its good, it sounds great.5. Music, sounds awesome for a watch, the watch has a few songs on it already but if you want more you need to connect it to a PC or laptop via USB and download songs to it as MP3s, have not tried this yet but seems straight forward enough.The worst thing and truly not a big deal was the screen protector they sent with it, it was gummy and dirty and looked cruddy when I put it on face of watch, so did not use.EDIT UPDATE - Have had the watch for a week or more now, and its pretty great, I did have some tech trouble with earbuds, but to be fair I am not an earbud person so I know little of how to use them.I was have trouble pairing them to both phone and watch music, turns out that it can only be paired to one music device at a time, makes sense, phone works either way with buds so all good.To change 24hr time and temps to imperial you need only go to the app on your phone and there you can change both.Again, Sound is great for a watch, and even better through buds, and like any digital reading device that is not inserted into your actual body, the readings of blood and temp are off by a degree or three give or take.A touch bulky, but not badAll in all for the money it seems solid and works great so far', ""This watch is pretty big but not too big for the average wrist. First of all, the battery life is awesome. I have managed for complete days with normal use and three days with normal use with earbuds. The earbuds are stored inside of the watch and the watch charges the earbuds.The sound quality of the earbuds is pretty good. There is enough bass and plenty of mids and highs. The earbuds are easy to use as they automatically connect when they are removed from the watch and placed I. Your ear. There is a right earbud and a left earbud and either can co trol the action with multiple touches to the earbud.The watch functions pretty much as all smart watches once synced with your phone. All of the normal setups and syncing are required. There is a button that takes you directly to set up and then you simply use the touch sensitive screen. There are multiple on board  native watch faces but you can download others. The watch has a built in music player that you can download music into the watch and listen to directly from the watch or earbuds or backsend to the phone. Playing music from the watch is achieved by a dedicated button and then touching the screen. Your phone music can also be played thru the watch as well. There is a volume control for the watch volume but there is not an  equalizer or sound shaper. This is not a serious problem as the sound is pretty balanced and clear.Phone calls can be answered thru the earbuds as well as the watch. A lot of the apps can be accessed thru the watch although they don't function as they would thru the phone. The notifications are pretty much on point (for example, My ring camera continuously gives.me notification and I can even view the images on the watch). Some apps are little query but as a whole functional.The negatives are you must download an app to connect to the phone and then you must connect the watch and then the earbuds seperately, but once done, they normally are listed in the connections menu. If you wear the watch on yourright arm, everything will feel normal but uf you wear tthe watch on your leaft arm the buttons will be inward towards you body as opposed to outward towards your hand. There is not a fix to change the orientation so that you can turn the watch and still be anle to read it correctly. I dont belie e there will be a fix as one has not come out yet and we have asked for one. I do recommend continuously checking for updates.As a whole this watch is highly recommended and fun to use.

It is a nice novelty piece that is highly functional."", 'Es un buen producto, con materiales resistentes y durables, con excelente terminado y detallado.Cumple con las características y especificaciones descritas.', 'I like that it’s easy to use and I can change earbuds if one bud battery dies. I really enjoy them very much', ""This watch was amazing while it lasted. I mostly used it for the earbuds. Which to my surprise were fantastic for the price point. Sadly though the watch only lasted 8 months for me, before it stopped charging one of the earbuds. Now it heats up the right bud to the point where it starts to melt and comes off as a safety issue. I'll end up buying one more of these watches from this brand and see how long it lasts before I give up on them."", ""For under 100$ you will not find better. the watch does everything a high end name brand watch does. Magnetic charging and downloading works great. Haven't charged it but once and still has over 80% battery life after two days. We will see how long that lasts and I'll repost in a few months. Only downside I have found is the blue tooth to the earbuds can be spotty sometimes so best to reconnect phone to earbuds before each use. That and you can't send text from the watch. Dial pad why not add the same kind of dial pad you see in the old clam phones with the multiple tap to reach different letters? Maybe they can add that feature in an update. Comes predownloaded with some pop songs also. Has 150 mbs of memory so about an hour worth of songs with the right dongle usb female to for my phone usbc male. You can load up your music right from your phone even charge your watch with it on the go. That way when you work out you don't even need to have your phone on your person. On another note wrist band is replaceable, but the one it has doesn't pinch and is secure. Don't go around punching stuff while wearing it the earbuds will pop out, but stay in place while running at full sprint.( Edit) ok so I've had this watch for over a month battery is still fine everything works great, aside from the weather app on it keeps giving me crazy weather like I live in the middle of a freezing to hot as the sun temps tornado. Ehh I've always said if you wanna know the weather go outside and look up! So no big deal for me. I have had one snag. While hiking one of the earbuds fell out of my ear. Can not! Buy replacements!!! Lucky for me and three hours of searching the trail I found it. So jam the little suckers in till you punch a hole in your eardrum or pick up something to keep them from dropping to the ground. I've been using dental floss. I've got to say I love this product!!!"", 'This is better than the Apple Watch. It’s already got earbuds and they sound good. It’s pretty accurate when it comes to my heart rate and BP measurements. Can’t text from the phone which is ok for me and it’s not an extra bill for me. Just Bluetooth and keep it moving', ""I own a Casio Databank and it has 5 alarms, a calculator, and slim design. This semi-smart watch has only 3 alarms, a calculator that doesn't work correctly (I mean how do you screw up a calculator they've been out for decades at this point), and it is not a slim fit; however, most potential buyers are probably more interested in the Bluetooth earbuds anyway. So how was the earbud experience? Okay to good is how I would rate them. Sometimes you'll get a cross fading issue (the audio jumps back and forth between the two earbuds rapidly for about a second), but otherwise they're loud, provide a good seal, have decent audio, straight forward controls, and it was quite convenient to have them on your wrist. I mainly used them to listen to podcast when I had a particularly tedious but mindless task to do at work. I never answered very many calls on the device so don't ask me about that and the notification center was rather bare bones. I would consider this 'watch' as a set of wireless earbuds in a unique case first, a watch second, and a smart device a distant third (the app for the device is permission hungry too by the way). If that suites you just find then give 'em a try, but as for me I went back to my Casio Databank but I do miss the convenient sometimes."", 'Watch no longer charges. It was good loved having the headphone on my wrist nice and loud .had to clean the gold pin connections about 10 times getting corroted.

Is it worth the upgrade? That depends.I am comfortable in the Suunto camp. I like their app and find the metrics they track are all I need. And the navigation feature is well implemented into the watch. And I like the look and build quality of the Suunto Peaks, and appreciate their commitment to zero carbon.You can read my review of the Peak Nine (hereafter called P9) here:[https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R2H3U2CT3VFECH/ref=cm\\_cr\\_othr\\_d\\_rvw\\_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094R67XPX].Build quality has not changed. You would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between the two watches visually-the Pro is slightly thicker and heavier than the P9. I don’t use notifications, sleep tracking or music playing, but I did test them, and they all work. The battery hardware and software is even better on the Pro than the already excellent battery on the P9.The Pro is a noticeable upgrade over the P9 in three areas: Visibility, Power, and Responsiveness.1. Visibility: While the screen is still darker than many other watches, and yes, that bevel is still there, the typography has been tweaked to make the metrics much easier to read. My 68-year-old eyes often struggled with the skinny narrow typography on the P9. This is a significant improvement, and I hope it is merged into the P9.2. Power: I train by power, and my aging Stryd is reaching its best-before date. While the Suunto reads Stryd power natively, I wondered if the built-in power would mean forgoing an expensive Stryd replacement. I found the Suunto power reading to be very similar to the Stryd power; tho the Stryd was more reflective of wind conditions. The Stryd gives more metrics, but I don’t use most of them.3. Responsiveness: The lag of switching screens or activities is, for the most part, gone. The Pro is far more responsive.Is the Pro worth the expense of upgrading? It depends on your needs. I was willing to upgrade based on screen legibility and for the option of not replacing my Stryd when it dies. And I have a son who is happy to have the Peak 9, which, due to its robust build quality, will be hard for even him to break! :-)I wish all of you miles of smiles, regardless of what is strapped on your wrist. UPDATED APRIL 13 2022 BASED ON LATEST SOFTWARESuunto has finally updated firmware to allow the importing of structured workouts from Training Peaks and other coaching sites. This is so useful and works easily and flawlessly. I only use Training Peaks, so can't say how well this works with other sites. This makes a good watch even better.  My only quibble is I wish there was a countdown timer when doing intervals, as I like to have a warning when an internal is going to change.UPDATED FEB 2022 BASED ON LATEST SOFTWAREOverviewHere’s my review based on a few weeks of running with the Suunto Peak 9. Because my needs and wants are different from yours, I will start with a brief description of what is important to me. Your mileage may vary! :-)To avoid confusion between the new Peak 9 and the previous 9, I will refer to the new model as the Peak, and the previous model as the 9.I’m 67 and have been running for over forty years and average 75 miles a week. I run marathons and ultras, but do not do triathlons, so I cannot evaluate the Peak 9 as a tri-watch. I do not listen to music or carry a phone when I run, so the Smartwatch features are not important to me. (I did test these, as noted below.) I don’t track sleep or recovery. I’ve been around long enough to know when I didn’t sleep well or have been overdoing my training. :-)I upgraded to the Peak 9 from a Suunto  My other current running watches are the Coros Pace 2 and the Fenix 5X.The Peak is a considerable upgrade from the 9. Lighter, smaller and with a sharper screen. I have skinny antenna wrists, and the Peak doesn’t look ridiculous on my arm like the 9 did. And the Peak does not snag on jackets.Aesthetics;The Peak is a beautiful watch. If Apple designed a sport watch, it would look like this. The buttons have a satisfying click, and the unit seems solid and well built.Controls;The Peak has both buttons and a touch screen. Personally, I do not like touch screens as I find them finicky and not as sharp and bright as a regular screen. Buttons always work, regardless of how many pairs of mitts you have on.And, unlike the 9, the Peak can be turned off. Why Suunto designed the 9 without an on/off switch is beyond me.Interface;The interface is easy to understand and is logical. A few runs, and you will control the watch instinctively. The Suunto app is also easy to use. My one issue with the interface is you cannot delete an individual workout. When I was setting up the watch, I did some test run inputs and could not figure out how to delete them. Searching the web shows it is not possible. UPDATE: UNWANTED WORKOUTS ARE EASILY DELETED ON THE WATCH.I did notice a slight sluggishness going from screen to screen. My Fenix 5X and Coros were much snappier. This did not bother me-it is microseconds-but did take a few runs to get used to.Sensors;The 9 is easily integrated with my chest strap and my Stryd footpad. I noticed that Stryd linking and recording as not as well implemented as it was on my Coros Pace 2, which has built-in power and was set and forget. The Pace2 is a sub $300 watch. I’m hoping Suunto will address this in a future firmware update. UPDATE: THE PEAK 9 LINKS EFFORTLESSLY TO THE STRYD POD. (THOUGH COROS INTEGRATION IS STILL BETTER.)Heart rate sensor;I cannot speak to this, as I have always had issues with wrist-based heart rate, and wear a chest strap. I am very skinny and boney and wonder if I cannot get a good fit. Reviews by others say the Peak has an acceptable reading.Screen;As mentioned above, I found the screen not as bright as a non-touchscreen watch. Granted, the glass is sapphire, which does tend to be duller than traditional glass. But, being clumsy, I’ll happily trade some brightness for durability. Another issue I assume Suunto will address in a future update is the typography. (I’m an OCD book designer fixated on legibility) Granted, my eyes are 67 years old, but I do have 20/20 vision, and I found the use of a thin narrow font on the watch face challenging to read especially when I filled the screen with metrics.Battery;I’m training for an ultra, and the long battery life of the Peak is essential to me. Setting battery usage is effortless and does not require deep dives into the system.Smartwatch features:I tested the music control features and notifications with my iPhone XS Max. (Now you see why I don’t run with a phone-beast weighs a ton.) Everything worked as it should.Alerts;The Peak has the option of vibration and sound alerts. The vibration is nice and buzzy, and easily felt. On the other hand, the sound is quite soft, and I often could not hear it in the wind. (I live on the North shore of PEI, and there is always wind.) I realize that the more water-resistant a watch is, the more muffled the beeper is, but I would sacrifice water resistance for a louder beep. If I ever find myself 100 meters underwater out on a run, I will have other things to worry about than water getting into my watch. :-0 )The Charger;The revised charger unit is a vast improvement—solid connection and almost impossible to screw up.Integration:I use Training Peaks, and the Peak connected seamlessly. I do not use Strava, but I assume that would work as well, as it is a far more popular app than Training Peaks.Snap to route;This was a major factor in my buying the watch. This allows for a more accurate distance and mileage read-out, especially in a city marathon or in rural areas where the satellite signal is often compromised. While I pace by power, it is comforting to know your GPS is spot on. This is not a feature I regularly use, just for races. (I think it would have been more accurate-and cooler sounding-to call it Race Snap.)Should you buy this watch?While only you can know if the Peak is worth your hard-earned $800, I think it is a good choice for the right person. If you run long distances, the battery management is well worth it. And it is the best looking sports watch I’ve ever owned.

The outlook was carefully designed using good material.PRO1. it looks beautiful.2. the battery last about 4 days under normal usage3. easy setup to pair with my Google phoneCON1. the font is little small to read, wish the font size can be enlarged as an option.', ""Très bon suivi lors des sorties, bonne autonomie  pour de longue sorties, l'application contient une full de données pour nous aider"", 'Used this watch for a year before writing a review.First off, it\'s smaller than the normal size Suunto watches (e.g. spartan ultra), and that unfortunately results in a substantial reduction in battery life - it is about 1/3 to 1/4 of the normal large size watch. You can barely get 5 days out of this battery after a year. It used to get about 8 days new.Compared to the larger watches, the display of this watch is really round (no notch at the 6 o\'clock position), but unfortunately the resolution is lower and the software isn\'t really well adapted - e.g. reading notifications is considerably harder as Suunto kept the icon size the same and text is only in the lower half of the display.The display is also a fingerprint magnet, but fairly easy to read. The new watch face introduced with the 9 renders properly both in standby and in active mode on this watch (in contrast with the big one on which is horrible). Colors are still limited and for example you won\'t get the yellow color used in all marketing materials.Also the bezel around the display is ridiculously large for something from 2021.The leash while on the shorter side has a space saving locking mechanism with a socket and pin that seems to be adequate and the material is nice.Sleep detection is somewhat inaccurate, some days up to a couple of hours and complete lack of detecting/tracking naps.O2 saturation detection is complete and utter joke. It is broken - it works once in a blue moon, like literary I have it set up to do constant during sleep but when I go to see it, the reading is often over 20 days old. Trying to trigger it manually is unreliable, as there is no interaction - it\'s up to the watch to show you an old inconsistent reading or try to obtain a new one and fail. Even when it somehow manages to get the O2 reading, it would be disturbingly low - often in high 80s, while other watches and medical devices would read 97-99 at the same time.The resource measurement is also inaccurate - you remove the watch and put it back on after a minute and somehow you have ""gained"" 15-20% of resources. You also don\'t get to see the details of why the watch decides what your current resource level is.On iPhones the Suunto app won\'t sync your heart rate data with the health app.The sports features work adequately and well most of the time, and the watch is quick to get a fix if it was recently synced, but if not, getting a fix can take more than 30 minutes, even when both gps and glonas have been enabled. Compass works well but it\'s harder to see on the smaller screen (mostly due to how large the bezel is). Navigation on the current track could have also benefited from a slightly narrower bezel.The interface and accessing different features is very easy to use. There is only one function overload which is the long press of the center button and you get a great visual feedback for that.Something that Suunto has broken on this watch is the ability to select time zone by name - you only have the time zone offsets, and while it has gps, it can\'t sync the time with the gps or figure out the time zone automatically.For the price of this watch, I wish it worked a little better, especially with sleep and o2 and had better battery life. Correcting the other minor annoyances would have been good as well.', 'Great watch but short battery life.If you use 3 or 4hours for work out, have to charge everyday…', ""I wanted a smartwatch that wasn't too clunky and fit in any environment. This fir the bill perfectly. Could do with a slightly brighter screen but it's not a deal breaker.

I've been wanting an all-contained smart-watch like this for a very long time at about this size and feature set (camera was a bit lower-quality than I would've liked, but that was a minor deterrent). After LESS than two months of use I'm confident this is completely unsuitable as a device you should wear on your limbs - unless your limbs simply do nothing all day.The clasp that holds the watch has rounded edges, for some reason. The first time I put the wrist-strap on, I was glad it could fit snugly on my relatively small wrists. I popped the device into the wrist strap and it seemed to hold just fine. Within a week I would discover I could force the device out of the strap by merely flexing my forearm a bit, if the strap was just comfortably-snug enough, so I started wearing the strap a little loose to prevent that, since the shape of the strap keeps it from sliding around too much even if not worn snugly. Within a month of wearing, I was strongly convinced the clasps were just not-good at holding the watch, so I would take the watch off anytime I did anything with a lot of movement (doing exercise or work or... pretty much anything but driving) and the entire concept of having the watch optionally-detachable defeated the purpose, as it was back in my pocket most of the day like a normal smart-phone would've been. This came to a final climax when I swat at a fly and the short arm-movement and wrist-flex was enough to pop the watch out (even with the strap worn loose) and projectile the device smack into a wall where the screen's glass shattered. Fortunately, the touch-input still works correctly and I never removed the protective film, so it's all held in place quite well, however the shattered screen cracks just spread all over the small display as a few days passed. The plastic, outer frame has also began crumbling apart, likely from the same trauma.It's quite unfortunate the strap-clasps are useless and the device has hardly any durability to it, because it really was a solution I've wanted for a while; I do not like carrying around a giant smartphone in my pocket and even more-so now that most of them all target larger displays with every passing year.Workflow wise, it paired just fine to my bluetooth keyboard and earbuds. Without the soft-keyboard on screen, I could write in Vim with Termux and listen to music with mpv. Termux was uncomfortable to use in portrait-mode though at a comfortable font-size, so I had to use a third-party app to force landscape-mode. The device also spoofs the MAC address every time it connects to a wifi network (and I couldn't find the setting to disable that with the custom Android 7 firmware) so you'll want to print the LAN IP every time you start sshd on the device. The 4G radio also worked with the Ting network, so I was glad the lack of 5G didn't cause a problem with my existing network. Google Maps did run into sporadic GPS issues while driving, but when it worked it was pretty accurate (nothing made the device heat-up as much as using GPS though).The processor was surprisingly capable also. Whether I used VLC-for-android or mpv within Termux, I had no problems with de-compressing 32kbit OPUS audio quickly and so I could hold a ton of decent-sounding music on the device even without expandable storage. I ran some Playstation 1 emulation and Arknights on the device with no noticeable frame-rate problems too, although I think the 30fps, 480p resolution display plays a large role in that.I expected this device to at least last a year, but that it barely lasted a month is severely disappointing. What's more, while I can blame the strap-clasps and the device for being very weak, it's not like the device was damaged without my own action - warranty doesn't cover me wearing the device and it flying off, turns out. I'm confident the device would be, at least, presentable if I can take the internals out and put them into a new frame with a new screen, but I'm very doubtful the company would provide that for me and it's not like I doubt the same situation will happen again within a month after.So basically, this is a great idea and it's the best attempt we've seen yet - but this ain't it, chief. Battery life drains too quickly while listening to music over bluetooth. Display should've been front-lit e-ink for better battery longevity too. No 5G radio is kind of absurd in 2021, let alone 2022. Camera may as well not be there for all the good that lens does (was hoping it could at least focus on text from a book for Google Translate, but alas the only text !gt could read from the camera was the giant text on the front of a book). Android 7 is severely insecure if you don't know what you're doing and/or care.Oh - one last thing. The power-connector magnets suck. Like, they are really, really bad. and will flop right off if you just brush it with your finger. I think I would've preferred a USB-C connection over this. Alternatively, keep a rubber-band around to hold the power-connector in place while charging. Yes it looks ghetto as hell, but I literally kept a heavy-duty rubber band along with the charging cable for this as it was often necessary."", 'Let\'s be honest. You only buy this for a novelty gadget, and yet it\'s still too expensive for what it can actually do. It would be perfectly priced at $90 US in my opinion.This is NOT the full fledged android device that most people are used to or probably expecting. This is a very cut down version of Android with a limited set of features and app compatibility.Having said that, I am surprised at what I can do, albeit with some necessary workarounds.SOME EXAMPLES1. Downloads Apps from the Google Playstore like most Android devices2. Downloaded and installed MyQ, the remote garage door opener app. Works great.3. Downloaded and installed the WYZE app, and can view my Wyze ""security"" cameras and control WiFi light bulbs.MUSICI could not figure out how to transfer music via the USB charging cable. I don\'t think it\'s possible. It shows up in Windows Explorer as a device, but it doesn\'t expose the underlying file system and thus transferring files will fail.There is no SD card slot, so that option is out as well.I had to download a network File Manager app from the PlayStore, and transfer my music files over WiFi either using FTP, or SMB. This is likely more technical than most consumers can deal with. If someone knows a simpler way, please let me know.Non-techie buyers are likely better off using a streaming music service like Spotify Etc.SIM CARDI have a pre-pay SIM card from Hello Mobile, and it seems to work fine in this watch. Not sure which major mobile network Hello Mobile provisions through, but I suspect that it is T-Mobile.So after 3 days of ownership, I\'m actually pleasantly surprised at what you can do, but feel that the price is too high for the limitations in screen readability, touch sensitivity and other areas where polish is lacking. Your mileage may vary.', ""I say potential because I haven't really done too much with it yet but this is a full Android device I have installed several apps and they work fine, it can't do everything and as some people indicate the default weather app doesn't function properly but so what you can install any weather app that's the whole point of it being an Android device this isn't about the software that it comes with but the fact that you can install new software onto it. I've had others like this and gave up on them because the bands kept breaking as I had to take it on and off constantly but this one the computer separates from the watch band and it does so brilliantly so you don't have to constantly put the band on and off stressing it. This also means you can hold the screen and it does reorient like your phone so it's not extremely user friendly because it's not your typical dumb smartwatch but it's perfect for anyone who wants something with much more power and capability."", 'I really wanted to keep the watch big nice screen.

This is not ideal, as I expect my kids to charge their watches.The second issue I faced is with the software. There are 2 issues. The watch needed to be rebooted 3 times before I could get the GPS working. The GPS isn't fully tested yet, but it appears to be now sending the correct location. I will test further and update this review.The other software issue is with receiving calls. We entered 3 phone numbers in the contacts. We can  no longer call the watch, but the user of the watch can call us. So I turned off the Reject Calls filter. At this point, every spammer in the world can call the watch. So how exactly does this contact number calling work? This is a serious bug and hence I am now going to return the watch. I will look for a different watch on amazon.com"", ""This 4G smartwatch by Pthtechus works decently. We purchased a $5 sim card so that my son can call us when needed. The sim card is not enclosed but can be seen on the back of the watch. It may be well protected but to see it just makes you feel like it will become damaged easily while hand washing. The camera is clear when we call and we can hear each other well. It shows the battery life and Wi-Fi connection at the top of the watch’s screen. In order to see how many steps he has, he must swipe to open the app on the watch each time. It does not show this information on the screen automatically. There is no flashlight which I think would be a nice feature for a child’s watch. The watch will need to be charged daily or every day and a half. The charger is a wrap-around type. So it cradles the watch and snaps closed. This is a very secure way to charge the watch but the cord is very thin which makes me feel like it will break or have a shortage over time with repeated use. There is an app to download on your phone so that you can have access to the watch (by using the QR code found in the watch). I have not been able to add additional apps, music, or games to this watch. We have access to the watch through the app; however, we have only been able to add contacts and make video calls from time to time over Wi-Fi. We have not been able to send messages. Each time we go to the app store on the watch, it says, “the software is not configured on the server.” When we go to the app store on the app on our phone, it does nothing. We have checked several different things and have been unable to troubleshoot this issue. I like the fact that you can take a picture of your child’s surroundings from your phone. There are volume controls so that you can turn the volume down or up when needed. It does not come preloaded with games other than a math matching game. It comes with a place for setting a schedule but this must be set up from the parent app. There are limited things the child can do which give the parent more control from the phone’s app; however, it is a little frustrating to operate at times. If you stick with setting alarms, telling time, and making calls, there is less frustration until your child wants to do more with it. After a few weeks of wearing the watch, my son takes it off and doesn't want to wear it. I think it is because there is not much to do on it and it is a little bulky for him (he's 8). You can adjust the screen’s brightness as needed from the watch itself. The GPS is several miles off but gives an approximate location. To wake the watch, press the red button on the side. When navigating the menu, press the company’s name at the bottom of the watch’s face to go back to a previous menu or press the red button on the side to go home. The watch can be restarted or shut down from your phone’s app. For the price of this watch, I was disappointed. I actually found that the learning smartwatch was a better fit for my child aside from the inability to control the volume. This is not an item I would purchase again. Maybe this was just a user error."", ""Even with the manual,  I can't set up the watch.  Extremely confusing and complicated 😕"", 'I ordered this product on 8/24/2021 and found it not works 6 weeks later. It just pass the return period window. I called amazon and they seems want to do nothing on it. I am really disappointed with this 6 weeks life span product, which costs  over $100. It is a trash and really bad choice.']"

An Amazon zur Gewährleistungsreparatur eingeschickt - Danach Rechnung von Fossil über 250 Euro (Uhr kostete 150) weil angeblich Display udn Boden defekt sind. Leider habe ich vor Kauf nicht gegoogelt, aber Fossil macht bei Uhrreparaturen mächtig Probleme (gibt sogar einen Spiegel-Bericht). Googelt mal Fossil Service Center und Probleme. Dann werdet ihr euch sicher nicht für eine Fossil mehr entscheiden. NIEWIEDER Fossil!Ich war anfangs durchaus zufrieden mit der Uhr. Sie ist praktisch die Verlängerung vom Handy. Man spart sich das herausnehmen vom Handy, da die Uhr anzeigt, was am Handy gemeldet wird.Telefonieren über die Uhr geht, allerdings muss man mit dem Mund so nah sein, daß man die Uhr fast abschleckt. Ausserdem darf es nicht zuviel Umgebungsgeräusche geben.Oft findet die Uhr die Verbindung zu google nicht, obwohl via Handy sehr wohl eine Verbindung besteht.Leider ist auch hier Bloatware vorinstalliert, die sich nicht restlos entfernen lässt.Dafür wurden plötzlich an die 30 Ziffernblätter einfach so gestrichen. Ohne Ankündigung oder Vorwarnung. Die Software wird also nicht vom User gesteuert sondern vom Hersteller. Eigentlich Betrug, denn die Uhr wurde mir mit über 50 Ziffernblättern verkauft und nach einem Monat habe ich nur noch ca. 30 zur Verfügung! (Details dazu findet man im Netz).Wecker: der Wecker meldet sich eine halbe Stunde bevor er eigentlich sich melden sollte mit der Meldung ""Weckalarm steht bevor""! Also jeden Wecker eine halbe Stunde später programmieren. Kann man in den Einstellungen nicht abstellen.Grundsätzlich positiv ist die Anbindung an Wear OS2.Der Schrittzähler ist etwas übermotiviert - der zählt garantiert doppelt soviele Schritte als ich gegangen bin.Der Akku hält, wenn man die Smartwatch als Smartwatch nutzt ca. 12 Stunden.

Unfortunately I lost it but was so happy with it I bought another to replace it. I was bummed I only got a few weeks out of it before the screen froze and stopped charging. I think it was just a lemon because I had zero problems with my first one that I had 1.5 years.', 'This is a review of the Fossil Woman’s Scarlette 38mm Hybrid Smartwatch HR.  Calling this watch a woman’s watch is a bit old school.  At 38mm it is pretty much the same size as a normal men’s watch.  I’ll  put a picture below of the Fossil next to a men’s Timex so you can gage size.A hybrid watch solves the biggest complaint smart watch users have; the inability to show the time.  Half the time you look at a smart watch is doesn’t tell the time but the smartwatch will be blank, in power saving mode or it will be showing the weather or some sort of statistics.  With a hybrid watch you get all the good stuff of a normal quartz watch with real hands (not a picture of hands).  Whenever you look - you can tell the time.If you look closer at a hybrid watch you will see that the watch face (behind the hands) is actually made up of a special display (low power like a Kindle Paperwhite).  This low power display is what allows the smart watch to have a read-out without using much battery.  Unlike a typical smartwatch which needs to be recharged every day the Fossil hybrid battery will last two weeks or more.  When it needs recharging a simple USB charger is all it needs.The first thing you will want to do when you receive your Scarlette (after you charge it) is to download the Fossil app onto your phone and follow the phone’s directions to connect the two.  Once they are connected your watch will automatically set itself to the correct time.  In the future it will maintain the same time as your phone.  Next you will want to take it to a local jeweler so they can adjust the band so the watch fits snugly against the wrist so the heart rate sensor on the watch back can do it’s work.  If you look at the back you can see the sensors blinking away.  Of course if you have a leather band you won’t have to get it adjusted.Out of the box the watch is ready to use.  The best way to learn its features is to dive right in. The display on the watch face uses a very tiny font.  As of this review there is no option to enlarge the font for the main display.  Be sure to write to Fossil support to request an option to enlarge the font.  I suggest using a magnifying glass while you are learning what the displays mean.  The tiny font is fine in good light but a little hard to read when the light is dim.  When I contacted Fossil support I was surprised when I got an email back from someone who had been assigned to my “case”.  Their support is excellent!When the watch arrives it will be set to the configuration called “Daily” and have four sections of information on the face (starting at the top and moving clockwise); battery with a picture of a battery and a percentage of charge remaining.  Then a picture of a shoe and the number of steps the watch has counted so far today.  Next is the day and date.  And lastly there is a picture of a heart and a number representing the beats per second the watch has detected.The three buttons are initially set to show the wellness dashboard (top button); Past notifications such as a text received (middle button) and Music control (volume & pause/play).  It is possible to change the buttons within the app.  My personal setup is:  top - activity start/stop; middle - wellness dashboard; bottom - weather report.Measuring activity is accomplished in the watch (and app) software.  In order to see additional measurements install Google Fit and connect the two apps.  In the app go to profile then Connected Apps.  The Fossil app shows active minutes while the Fit app shows minutes on the move (in my opinion these should be the same - but it is what it is).  There are additional settings on the watch (not in the app).  Long press (2 seconds) the middle button to get to settings, then bottom button to walk your way through the choices.As a test I checked my heart rate on the Fossil watch, on my Fitbit Sense, on a blood pressure cuff and on a finger blood oxygen gizmo.  All four measurements were in perfect agreement.  The step counter is a different matter.  I used the watch, Fitbit, and two apps on my phone to count steps.  I got four different numbers.  In the end I decided the exact step count didn’t really matter as long as one chooses one system and sticks to it.I love my watch.  It is the best looking watch I have ever owned and it elegantly replaces the Fitbit smart watch that I have learned to despise.', 'I really liked the looks of this as a fitness tracker disguised as a fashion watch. Unfortunately my wrist is very small and it looked large and was a little heavy for me so I returned it.', ""So far I like this watch.  It is my first smartwatch of any kind--replacing my old Fossil watch that I've had for around 30-years.  I still have that old watch and it actually works ok, though it slows down when it needs new batteries which is about once a year.Anyhow, this watch seems to work fine, however it has a couple moderate issues that are the reason for the lost star.  First, sometimes it is slow to sync steps, etc. with the phone, and I often have to go into the Fossil app. and even then it's slow (like won't sync all day, only after I go in the app).  Update, after having the watch a few weeks, it seems that the charge lasts about a week.Second, the image and description claim a blue dial.  The dial on the watch I received is about as blue as the sky at midnight... so basically black--with only a blue tint if you tell yourself there is a blue tint.  The gold with black, on a fairly large watch face, make this seem more like a man's watch."", 'Pretty disappointed to receive this watch today and find that the watch face is not blue as advertised, but black. Also, the band is roughly 1"" too large for my very average-sized female wrist. With no tools included to adjust this, I now need to take time to find a jeweler to resize my watch? Debating sending this back. I bought this to replace my Apple Watch which was too complicated... and now I may not be able to use it for a week while I wait to have it resized. Bummer.', 'It does everything I expected and  fits perfectly. Love the rose gold.', 'Returned because looks different in reality but functions as advertised', ""I did not see the weight of the product while purchasing. I actually bought it as a gift for my mom she rejected. Directly as it's too heavy. I was mesmerized by the design so i did not see any details before booking i need to return the product for other item"", 'I’ve owned this for maybe a year. Doesn’t keep time and face glass is scratched. Very nice looking watch otherwise.']"

Phone and text alert was kind of a weak vibration I found no way to increase intensity as far as  I could find - but not a game  changer for me it was doable.  I charged it fully upon receiving it. Charges very fast. Then charged 1.5 days from initial charge. I thought maybe it blew through battery so fast was the fact I was trying to figure out how to work it.

I bought her an iWatch and was impressed with how sleek it was and with its health options. Everything I read indicated the Galaxy Watch 3 was the most comparable to Apple\'s product, so I gave it a shot. How disappointing.It\'s functional enough, I suppose. It\'s got a clock and it records walking steps and heart beat. I can press \'next track\' from the phone when using DSub for music. Neat, I guess, but its big selling point, the ECG, is apparently still not enabled here in Japan with no timeline for when it will be. This was probably the biggest reason I bought it, so right away it loses half its value to me.I tried to make the best of it, but most of the time it was just in the way. It\'s not uncomfortably heavy, but it\'s noticeable and doesn\'t ""disappear"" until needed like a good accessory should. (To be fair, I got the larger version, but only because the color I wanted wasn\'t available in the smaller size.) But the biggest issue to me, personally, is the goofy UI and application style. Everything about its design feels like it was from 10 to 15 years ago, with ugly geometric quasi-retro shapes. When using the charger, there is a hyper-cute star character... thing... that greets you. The mod-art illustrations in the health app look terrible. It feels like it\'s designed to appeal to a child.If any of that was changeable, then it would be less of a problem, but the user options are minimal at best. Aside from the clock faces, there is very little that can actually be modified, and for something you would likely be expected to look at throughout the day, I expect more options, or at least a better UI to begin with.I looked around the app store to see if there was anything that presented something new and interesting and maybe even useful, but it was all variations on heartbeat monitors and religious apps. An absolute wasteland.It has its good points. The strap is leather, and the body itself feels sturdy. The ring dial is a great interface and was the thing I liked most about it. But without the ECG app and no exact date for when it will be enabled, it\'s a mostly useless curio on my arm that doesn\'t contribute any great value to my life. I\'ll be returning it soon and looking into other options.', '以前はHuawei を使ってましたが、やはり同じ機種の、方が良いと思いGALAXYに変えました。すぐに接続も簡単に出来たし、LINEの返信も出来る事には驚きました。残念なのは、充電が1日しか持たないことですね。皮膚が弱いのでシリコンが使えないのも残念です。それ以外は申し分ないです！', 'Functionality for Japan is just not there yet. I like the watch and the UI but no ECG and even oxygen level during sleep measurement leaves me wishing I kept using my fitbit ionic for the time being.  I must admit however, the galaxy watch3 excels in sports data. My cycling and runs have phenomenal breakdowns on splits, heart rate but again would be great to have the functionality that is available on the same watch overseas. I charge the watch every 3 days for day to day with too and from work. I and also wear it for sleep. You will need to charge sooner if you measure sports, listen to music etc. Will be a high 4 once we have full functionality available.I use this with my Samsung galaxy note 20 phone as a point of reference and cannot comment for usage with other phones.Cheers', '防水機能もあり、GALAXY端末使ってる人は相性いいです。ベルトもいろんなのに代えれるので、Applewatchよりも安価でいいです。', '手頃な値段になったので、あえてGALAXYwatch3にした。バッテリーは1.5倍もつ感じ、血中酸素濃度は適当な数値、本体はチタンだが、バンドはステンレス。チタンの良さが分からない。睡眠計測は進化して、詳細になり、更にいびきなども計測出来るようになった。', '色々見て購入しましたが、やはり自分のスマホとつながるのと、同じメーカーでわかりやすいと思いました。電話も確認できるし、急な用事でも対応できて安心します。高い買い物でしたが、購入して良かったと思っています。', '前回持っていたGalaxy Gearの電池が持たなくなってきたので、ここぞとばかりに買い替えました！私の場合であれば、ベゼル｢上の回して操作する部分｣をカスタムでデザインをスタイリッシュに、かつ、保護をしてくれるパーツを貼り付けています！とても見え方もかっこいいし中の時計の画面を服によって変えることも出来て、重宝しております。ただ、少し前のGEARより大きくなっているので、服によっては袖が引っかかりますのでご注意ください。僕はそれで服を破いてしまいました（笑）', 'ベルトを色々ラバーのカラフルなものに付け替えて、楽しんでます。フレームをシルバーにしてよかったです。ベルトの色も合わせやすいです。GALAXYとの相性は、言うまでもなくストレスフリーです。当初は、予定もしてませんでしたが、このコロナ禍で、心拍数などは自分の健康面の目安になってきてます。', 'バンドが短い', '充分な性能でした']"

I had ordered the watch with the black band that was labeled ""Genuine Leather,"" well, it is not 100% genuine leather. It is actually silicone with a very thin layer of leather over it. I am shopping for a new band today because this one makes my wrist so sweaty and uncomfortable that I  take the watch off in random areas of my home, and then I can\'t find it. So, if you choose, the one with the leather band, just take note that it is actually not 100% leather. The part that will be touching your skin is silicone.Short Version:  The watch itself is amazing. It is beautiful.  It is very customizable. And the materials they\'ve used seem to be of high quality. The app has some great features, but it has connectivity issues where it will disconnect from my watch, and the only way to reconnect it is to restart my phone.Long Version:  The watchband is real leather. The watchcase seems to be quite sturdy. It has a nice weight to it, without it being too heavy.  The colors are nice. It is large enough, and the contrast is high enough that it is easy to see, even without my glasses on (my vision isn\'t terrible).  I bought this watch because of the looks, as well as the long battery life. What I didn\'t realize until I got it home, was that it was also very customizable.  The little circles that you can see on my watch can be rearranged, swapped out, or you can leave those spots blank. You can also choose to have the entire background be blank instead of showing the extra information.  There are several backgrounds you can choose from, or you can choose a picture that you upload to be your watch background.  The different things you can display on you watch face (inside the little circles):1. A second timezone of your choosing.2. The chance that it will rain in your current location today.3. How many minutes you have been active so far today.4. How many steps you have taken so far today.5. The active calories (not including basal calories) that you have burned so far today.6. The amount of battery life that your watch has.7. The current weather in your current location.8. The day number and day of the week that it is.9. Your current heart rate.These can all be placed in whichever circle you want them to be placed in. The only annoying thing is, when you are rearranging them, you can\'t place, say, the weather on your screen twice. This means that to move the weather information, you first have to take it off and place something else (that you don\'t want to keep) in that location so that you can place the weather in the location that you want.  The little buttons on the side of the watch can be changed as well. First, I will cover what they always do.Top button:  If you push the top button once, it will do the function that you have set it up to do. If you HOLD the top button, it will turn on and off the background. You can make the background blank; just showing what you have set as your background, or have all the little circles visible.  The top button is also how you move backward or up when you are looking through your messages or using the different features.Center button:  If you press the center button once it will display whichever setting you have chosen for it to do. In my case, I have it set up to display my messages.  If you HOLD the center button, it will bring up the different settings inside the watch.1.  About information2.  Do Not Disturb settings.3.  Dial information on/off.4.  Ring my phone; for if you can\'t find your phone.5.  Connect to friend challenges.6.  Music controls.7.  View notifications.8.  Stopwatch.9.  Timer.10. Wellness (this displays the hours you have slept or the time you have exercised today, your steps, and your calories. If you press the down button when you are in the wellness face, it will check your current heart rate. It will also tell you your resting and max heart rates for the day.)11. And lastly, you can see the workout features, where you can measure your workout. The different workouts it can measure are running, cycling, hiking, walking, treadmill, elliptical, weights, row machine, ""Spin"",  and ""workout"".  If you HOLD the center button when you are on any screen, it will bring you back to your main watch face.  The center button is also used as an ""enter"" button. You press once to select whatever the highlighter is on.Bottom button:  If you press the bottom button once while on the main screen, it will bring up whatever setting you have chosen.  Holding it does nothing.  The bottom button is also how you move forwards and down within all of the settings.Customization options for the buttons:  Each button can be set up with a feature that you want quick access to. I have mine set up to show the weather with the top button, my notifications and messages with the middle button, and my wellness dashboard with the bottom button.  You can choose to set up yours with workout mode, stopwatch, music control, timer, commute time, connect challenge, weather, past notifications, and wellness dashboard.Phew! I tried to be as helpful as possible for that portion because Fossil doesn\'t send you any real instructions. They send you a ≈1/2 inch book that basically just tells you not to eat the battery in 50 different languages.  Now for the downside, the app. The app has a lot of great features, but my watch is getting disconnected about once per day. Sometimes I am lucky and it only does it every other day.  When this happens, I have to restart my phone to reconnect my watch. I have tried force stopping the app, clearing the cache, turning on and off the Bluetooth, reconnecting within the app, none of that works.  I have to restart my phone and then open the app and click connect to reconnect.  It isn\'t the watch either, because Amazon sent me a replacement and it does it with both the old watch and the new one. I have tried tech support with Amazon and Fossil. Neither company can find a solution.  I have a Google Pixel 3, so it isn\'t some antique, cheap phone. I even joined a Facebook group for Fossil Hybrid watch owners, and it seems to be an issue that a lot of people have.  I didn\'t have this problem with my old Fitbit either, so it can\'t be my phone.  The 4-star review is due to the syncing issues. If Fossil could fix these issues, this would be a 5-star watch.  Would I recommend this watch to a friend? Yes. As long as they have the patience to handle the syncing issue.', 'Really love the watch. Easy to use; instructions for setting up are easy to follow.Package was good but outer cover was a mess!Thanks a lot,  Amazon and Fossil!', '7/24/21 update (7 months of ownership)...5 star customer service and 4.5 star watch. I had so many issues with my original, Fossil Customer Service ended up sending me a replacement once I returned my defective. The exchange was done in about 9 days. I received a brand new watch and ever since, it hasn\'t had a single issue! YAHOO!! My first may have been a lemon. Customer service is legit. Quality company and attractive watch! I\'ve received a few compliments.  :) BUY IT.As for my first review, I finally figured out the date issue. You can\'t have a customized background and be able to see the date on the watch. Lame. If you have the regular face with the 4 dials, the date can show there. That\'s become my preference.Initial review....This is a 3.75 star watch. Here\'s why....Pros:+I\'ve had this watch since 12/27/2020....today is 2/10/2021. I have only had to charge the watch 3 or 4 times since I got it which is impressive! (5 stars)+The face is gorgeous and classic. (5 stars)+The glass face appears very sturdy and not likely to break easily. I\'ve whacked my wrist into many doorways and you can\'t tell. (10 stars)+I love the customizable backgrounds. Just download or use whatever picture you want and that\'s what you get to see in black and white. I love the mandala I found! (5 stars)+I like the customizable buttons. I\'ve settled on workout mode at the top, overview of my calories/steps in the middle and a stopwatch on the bottom. I use all of them frequently. The workout mode blows but it\'s all I have to work with. (4 stars)Now for my issues...- Compared to my friend\'s Apple watch, the Fossil watch grossly under tracks steps and distance. We hike a lot and her watch is MUCH more accurate. It\'s usually around half a mile off or 1,500 steps different. Very upsetting. (2 stars)-Navigating through the workout modes is so freaking dumb. I\'ve had this watch 2 months and I\'m still a bit confused. (1 star)-Probably my BIGGEST irk is that I can\'t find the dang date. When I find the screen that shows my steps, heart rate and calories burned, the screen says ""Today"" with a calendar symbol. Yes you dumba*s watch, I know it\'s TODAY, but what\'s the date?!? (-5 stars)-Overall functionality of the technology is lacking. (2 stars)I do like the watch overall, I\'m just incredibly disappointed with the lack of accuracy for the fitness data and difficulty of navigating the workout modes. I find the intelligence to be a few fries short of the happy meal.So yeah, solid 3.75 stars. Could use some work but I love the look with my leather band.', 'This watch arrived and hour ago and I am IN LOVE WITH IT.I have a thing for watches, and own about 2 dozen of them, mostly cheap ones, which will now be rarely used because this is about to replace them all. I have already switched out the watchband on this one, which was super easy.I like the idea of a smartwatch but they\'re just not elegant, I hate the LED look, and the plain black screen when they\'re off, and I do not like square faces. I tried to get on board with a fitbit but it\'s just ugly, and was annoyed at how often I had to charge it.Since I\'ve had this an hour, I can\'t speak to the battery life or overall durability (I will update later if I have problems), but it\'s a beautiful watch, and it does exactly what I want it to do, but nothing more. It\'s not packed with stupid features, it focuses on well-executed simplicity. I don\'t want to play solitaire on my wrist, I don\'t need a bunch of apps. I want it to tell time, look like a quality, classy piece of jewelry, and give me basic smart functions, like showing notifications and counting my steps. It does do *much more* than that, it has exercise modes, a timer, music controls, a do-not-disturb setting, and other things that a tech-appreciative watch-loving adult would want, but not a bunch of clutter.One thing I find especially cool is that you never have to set the time. Even though the outer rim and the analog watch hands are physical, not digital, the watch syncs to your phone and automatically sets the time. If you get on a plane and land in diff timezone, it will adjust, just like your phone. The hands also move out the of the way (pointing to 3 & 9, becoming a straight line across the face) when you\'re viewing your notifications. Also this watch is NOT a touchscreen! It is controlled by the 3 buttons on the side. The casing is a teeny bit thicker than I\'d like, sitting higher off my wrist, but it\'s not too bad and it\'s a very minimal sacrifice for such a fine piece.It is truly a ""hybrid"" watch; the best parts of a classic analog and a digital smartwatch.There are more reviews on listings for different styles of the same model (gold/black faces, different bands, etc), and I recommend you read them, too. Many of them were helpful to me.But basically if you want some smart features without giving up the classic look, feel, and analog display of a ""real"" watch, this is for you.', '• This a a good looking watch. I am very pleased with its appearance. I love to be able to upload pictures or messages on a dial screen. These looks superbly, not too sharp, natual - which is exactly what I wanted.• With heavier usage the battery lasts at least 8 days.  I would hate to have to charge the battery every day, this is one of the main reasons why I did not get a full on smart watch.• This watch does not have too many features, however I did not want to have another phone on my wrist. I mainly wanted to be notified a.s.a.p. when some important notifications arrives on my phone. However I found that the watch frequently disconnects from my phone if I dont keep a close distance and does not reconnect automatically. Which is a major lwt down. I hope there will be an upgraded soon to sort this issue out.• The step count is not acurate, I wake up with at least 50 steps every morning 😂Overall I am not sure if this watch is worth almost £200. I had a gift card and used towards it, which made the price more acceptable to me. Would I buy it again? Probably yes, I love the appearance and all the extra features, even if they are quiet basic.', 'Always viewable analog hands are great.  Provides more than enough smart features for my needs.  Adds a bit of ""bling"" which is nice.  Quite large, which can be good or bad depending on your perspective', 'Very lovely product..I like it', 'Prior to buying this 6+ months ago, I wore a FitBit Alta, a FB Flex before that. I loved the Alta. Sleek enough design, plenty of attractive bands available to match my other accessories, and it checked all my function boxes: time, activity, heart rate, see who\'s calling or texting, sleep tracking when I wanted it. I didn\'t buy another FB because [1] I was tired of having to replace it every 1-2 years when the battery crapped out; [2] the far greater aesthetic appeal of an actual watch (I find most \'smartwatches\' hideous); [3] as a chronically weather-inappropriate dresser, I was excited about the weather capability.Pros:The Fossil Charter doesn\'t disappoint in the looks department - A+. I love the brushed gold finish, and the simplicity of the watch face.The battery life is very good. I don\'t even have to charge weekly.Cons:-I hate the closure on the band; I\'m constantly pinching myself and spending 5 minutes just trying to get the thing on.-Syncing is always manual. Boo.-The UI gets a big fat F in the ease-of-use department, and none of the literature it comes with even helps! Even after finally figuring it out, it\'s so unimpressive.-The weather feature I was so excited to have returns a ""Request timeout"" error 60% of the time.-The activity tracker is pathetically inaccurate; I have a ""move"" reminder set to trigger if I\'m ever sedentary for a full hour, and it almost exclusively goes off -while- I\'m moving; It asks ""Are you working out?"" when I\'m brushing my hair, but not when I\'ve been trimming tree limbs and lugging them 100 yards to the curb for 3 hours. I\'ve tracked long walks with friends who use other devices and come up with a full half-mile discrepancy (can\'t argue their tracker was wrong when it shows an actual map!).-I stopped even trying to start the activity-specific tracker manually, because every time I\'d look down mid-hike and see that it apparently paused itself 20 minutes earlier.-I often have to switch to another screen to get the tiles on my \'home\' screen to catch up.-Just today it started what may be its most annoying tic yet: the battery is getting low (I can think of no other reason), so it keeps repeating the notification from a phone call I received last night, intermittently vibrating until I accept or decline a call that happened 14 hours ago. This has happened 4 times this morning.In short: The price is FAR too high for the quality you get. Fossil\'s got aesthetics down, but I think we already knew that. They have a long, LONG way to go in the tech department.', 'I researched this product and several others before I made my decision. What I wanted was a classic looking watch that didn’t scream “smart watch” but also was a smart watch. This product fit the bill perfectly. I love that I can customize the face with pictures and which application I want to view. It’s very similar to the paper white technology so it is easy to read and back lit once you tap it. My notifications come up easily and through the fossil app on my phone I can control what I see and what I don’t. The side buttons are nice and tight, and programmable for quick access to timer, notifications, health and more. The hands do glow in the dark and make it easy to read without having to back lite. The black one I purchased came with a very nice leather band and I purchased a stainless band to use daily so as not to ruin the leather one. The process was easy and painless, all tools included. Battery life depends on how much you allow the watch to do. When I have more notifications and alarms set my battery lasts about a week to a week in a half. When I cut it back to just my text messages, I have been able to get almost 2 weeks easy out of it. It charges rather quickly. I’ve had my watch about a month and for the most part it has been within range on steps and heart rate however if I’m doing something with my hands (like knitting) my step count can sometimes get a little out of range.

I'm new to the fitness watch scene and had ordered the FitBit primarily to keep track of my pulse and sleep pattern. The CKG watch seems to do as good a job in these two areas and the FitBit at a quarter the price. The display is large, bright, easier to use than the much smaller FB and has no bugs that I've detected so far. The battery life is great - better than a week! The Blood Pressure monitor doesn't seem at all accurate, and I'm not sure of the SPo2 function is either, but that's not why I bought the watch. The App is decent, seems stable, but has a very ugly orange background color which I can live with since it's free and has no ads. I immediately bought a replacement metal band as the two bands provided were cheap plastic, but for the money I hadn't expected much. Bottom line, I think this fitness tracker performs at least as well as the more expensive Charge 5 at a fraction of the price.

I don't think they should offer bio metric features that are not precise,  especially pertaining to medical issues.

I then bought the Max S.  This review will cover the features common to both models, as well as the differences.Both watches are unique in that they run under the Android operating system. In addition to the smart watch type of interface both models have, you can also install apps from the Google Play Store that allow you to change the look and feel.  Personally, I use Square Home launcher.Here is a summary of the pros and cons of each watch:Pros:1. Feels comfortable on my wrist in spite of its size.  Able to wear all day.  The Max S, being slightly smaller, is a bit more comfortable.2. Able to run many applications from the Google Play Store.  Most importantly is running a launcher that can completely change the device's interface.3. Good battery life - about 2 days with normal use for the Max.  About 1 day for the Max S.  Both charge in about 2 hours.4. Using a sim card (I am running under T-Mobile) it is able to make calls, texts and all other things a cell phone can do.5. Has WiFi, Bluetooth and USB connectivity.6. By wearing on your wrist as a cell phone, it frees up both hands and eliminates the need to carry a large cell phone.Cons:1. The small screen (compared to a cell phone) makes it difficult to see many apps.  It also requires apps to run in landscape mode.  It takes a fair amount of time finding apps on Play Store that run in landscape and that also allow the size of the font to be enlarged.  It should be noted that the smaller screen size of the Max S makes it very difficult to read some apps.2. Smart watch fitness functions are limited to steps and heart rate.  The device cannot read blood pressure, oxygen level and temperature.3. The standard interface that comes with the device is that of a smart watch - the problem is that applications installed on the watch show up as a lot of icons not sorted in any particular order.  This is why getting a launcher from Play Store is important.4. A very large number of free watch faces are available when running under the smart watch interface.5. Screen brightness could be better.  Not a problem indoors, but outdoors is another matter.6. While it can pair with your cell phone using bluetooth, you cannot make calls or texts.  You have to have a sim card to do that.These devices are not for everyone.  They would not work well for a heavy cell phone user.  For me, however, it is perfect.  The occasional text, email and phone calls I make and receive make this practical with the advantage that my phone is always with me.The photos attached show different views of the Max.  The first 3 are from the standard interface.  The second 3 are using the Square Home launcher.  Note how you can display calendar and weather widgets.As I mentioned at the beginning, I had the Max, then sold it to get the Max S.  After a few days of using the Max S, I am returning it and buying another Max.  The screen on the Max S is just too small for my eyes.  I also miss the longer battery life of the Max.  The Max S does come with an additional camera which the Max lacks, and there are some additional watch faces lacking in the Max.Overall, both models are good choices if you want a smart watch that offers more customization options than anything else on the market."", 'I initially started out with this guy\'s little brother, the ""Note"" or ""Max S"" with a 2.4"" screen and it was great. Unfortunately the band broke and I had to end up exchanging it, so I opted to go for this larger 2.8"" version.It\'s basically identical in every way except for the larger screen and larger battery. And the larger battery alone is worth the price of admission. With the smaller watch, I would be lucky to make it through a 10 hour day but I have no worries at all on the larger battery (2,800mAh vs. 2,000) and if I\'m not using it much I can get two days out of it. The charger is also better and hugs/fits the watch WAY better. The smaller watch was flat with weak magnet and you have to babysit it. This one gives confidence and charges quickly.Nothing against the ""stock"" UI but I replaced it with Nova Launcher for a true raw Android experience and found a suite of apps to get it exactly the way I want it. You can side load .apks into it if the Play store says it\'s incompatible for some reason. I\'ve found 99% compatibility in general though, but keep in mind it\'s Android 7.1 so anything higher probably will have issues. Still a ton of apps out there that support it though. It would be nice to see this get an update but I doubt it. My biggest concern is how long will it last running 7.1?This is very customizable and is standalone which eliminates the need to carry a phone. I\'m a field engineer/inspector and I can leave my phone in the truck charging and walk the field and still have instant access to anything on my wrist and make calls either through the speaker or Bluetooth. You could conceivably Zoom on this thing with its forward-facing camera, I haven\'t tried it. The sound is decently loud and of course it supports Bluetooth accessories. Apple Music works and looks great on this! The scaling of the screen makes it work like a mini-tablet, it\'s a 640x480 display but at retina density. The screen is really good, IPS, crystal clear, bright, it\'s where the money\'s at. Typing on it isn\'t really bad at all and I have big hands. Voice dictation is even better though, which it supports.It definitely feels like an Inspector Gadget type device and I\'m an inspector so it\'s perfect. Also, to be sure, the hardware within is accurately represented and it does support LTE bands on T-Mobile. I tried AT&T and it sort of worked but I guess you just have to talk to them and they can get it working. I didn\'t try since mine uses T-Mobile (which isn\'t great indoors but this also has wi-fi obviously). It\'s my understanding there\'s an updated Android 9 version out there that isn\'t nearly as good for several reasons.I look forward to a proper updated version with further shrinkage and feature additions perhaps. You\'ll never get this level of customization on an Apple Watch and try watching YouTube on one.', 'Bought it specifically for EUC Riding so that I can see real-time stats on my wrist, but also tested it while snowboarding and at the gym.============What I LIKE:============- The screen is a good size for what I\'m looking for.  It fits even while wearing wrist guards.- Battery life is good enough to use the ""Relive"" app (uses GPS) snowboarding for 4 hours.- Battery charges quickly, and charger uses magnets to connect to watch instead of plugin USB.- GPS and Wi-Fi work flawlessly.  Google Hangouts works well when connected to Wi-Fi or cell phone hotspot, and I receive updates on the watch that normally go to my phone.- I did NOT test with a SIM card, so I have no feedback on that feature.==================What I DO NOT LIKE:==================- BUTTONS AND SPEAKER:  The buttons are on the right side of the watch, as is the speaker (design flaw, in my opinion) because...  * While exercising and your hand flexes back (like when doing pushups or front squats with a barbell)  ** my hand would block the speaker, so I couldn\'t hear my music  ** the buttons would be pressed, which would turn off my running app.  * When using my watch for EUC Riding, I like to have my EUC World app running so that I can see live stats by looking down at my wrist.  ** During my ride, I may flex my hand up, which will press the buttons, so my app either turns off or gets moved to the background then turned off.  * If the buttons and speaker were either at the top or bottom of the watch, then this would not be an issue.- LOCK SCREEN:  The Lock/Unlock pattern feature doesn\'t work so well.  ""Face unlock"" works well most of the time.  * If I press the face of my watch while exercising or riding my EUC, the unlock pattern comes up, and and it never tracks my finger movement through the entire pattern --- it traces half my pattern, then loses contact, then continues, but sees the end of my pattern as the start of a new pattern, so logging on NEVER happens on the first attempt.  * I have disabled the lock screen (pattern feature), but it still comes up all the time, which makes using this watch difficult to use when I\'m being active.  Sitting on my couch, I have more time to mess with the unlock feature, but when you\'re on an electric unicycle or at the gym, it\'s super irritating.  If I disable the feature, IT SHOULD STAY DISABLED.  * ""Face unlock"" works well most of the time, but it sometimes brings up the pattern unlock screen that gets in the way (even after disabling it), so I\'m forced to use the pattern unlock, which doesn\'t work consistently.- APPS SHUT DOWN:  * I have tried running 2 apps at the same time, but one or both always shut down.  ** I run ""EUC World"" to see my real-time stats and ""Relive"" to track my ride.  One or both will stop working when I\'m not looking, but I\'m not sure if it\'s due to the button placement issue mentioned above.  * I have gone snowboarding with my ""Relive"" app, and it only tracked half my activity because the app shut down at some point, probably due to the button placement.- CANNOT TRANSFER FILES TO WATCH MEMORY:  * I am limited to listening to music over the internet since I cannot transfer music to the watch.  * Using the USB Charger connected to my computer, attempting to copy a file always returns errors:  ** Windows 10:  ""Cannot copy item.  The device has either stopped responding or has been disconnected.""  ** Linux:  ""The location is not a folder""  ** WiiWatch2 App (on cell phone):  ""SD Card temporarily unavailable""  *** Can transfer files from phone memory, but all my music is on SD.  *** File transfer through app limited to 50mb/file.I really wanted to like this watch but ended up returning it since it was more frustrating to use when going on EUC rides or using as a heart rate monitor since the buttons are in a place where they can be pressed without knowing, and it turns off my apps.', ""UPDATES:You'll find that many apps aren't supported except in portait mode which is unusable when the watch is worn. Examples are RadarNow which is a very useful app to display a weather map. Many other apps will appear to work but then after setup default to portait mode (actually sideways on the watch). This isn't the fault of the app but rather a function of the non-standard display resolution that can't be changed via a setting in the formware.Some of the built-in apps do nothing, for example the calendar. It does only that but doesn't allow you to schedule events of kind, its just a calendar. I so wish the manufacturer would finish the apps included because otherwise they just take up space and provide no functionality.Then we get to some what should be very simple thing like changing the volume. What is simple on every other device is tedious on the watch. If you are listening to music or watching some video clip or streaming radio you can't easily change the volume. You must get to setting to change it, no way to do so from a pulldown.I'm removing a star because the more I use this watch the more I'm finding that what should be very simple things to do are very tedious and nearly impossible to do without taking the watch off.It is what it is, a small cellphone on a wide watchband. WARNING: Many apps and even some of the setting will not work in landscape mode so you must either take the watch off of turn it as view in portrait mode or twist your head to use it. That some of the settings don't work in landscape mean the theme for the OS overlay either wasn't finished or someone forgot something. I tired changing the settings but its a problem with the OS as implemented on the watch. This can be unnerving when you load up an app and simply can't get it to landscape mode yet the same app will work in landscape on a phone or tablet. I am betting this has to do with the resolution of the display, the apps and some setting won't recognize the landscape position of the display and thus you are stuck.This is running version 7 of Android. Android is currently at version 10. With 3 gigs of Ram it should be able to run version 10. The only reason I can think its running the old version is because this is basically a repurposed older small cellphone model that used to be sold and repurposed to the a wrist watch style device.I did notice that when running some apps that the Ticwris gets warm, very warm. On a cooler winter day it might not be a big deal but I can tell you that in warm to hot weather you will not want to wear this as your wirst will do a slow cook.I am not sure if constant heat from the phone will have any effects on your health, the heat coming from the phone is enough on a warm day to really heat up your wrist.After wearing this for more an a few hours I couldn't wait to take it off. The skin under the watch is really warm and moist, this is not like wearing a regular watch, even large watches. I often wear an Android brand 50mm self winding watch and it is both heavy and thick but it also doesn't generate its own heat.All that aside, the one major improvement would be a physical home button.Ticwris should really offer an OS upgrade to anyone who bought one of these. It would go a long way to knowing we didn't buy an orphan product that in a year will be more or less worthless. As the Android OS keeps getting new version numbers developers are less and less willing to support devices running Version 7."", 'It didn’t sync with my iPhone 13 max.So i could not see my msgs or answer calls.It worked as a prepaid phone itself.But if you play YouTube or stream videos. You will spend a fortune. It’s more like an emergency prepaid phone itself with its own #.Also it gets too hot when you’re wearing it and play YouTube.', 'I\'ve had this phone for about 6 months. Ample time to figure out pros and cons.Pros:Make and receive calls. Also texts.Downloads all apps. Most will work, but some won\'t. Ring app you can monitor, but not make any changes or enable live view. My garage app worked as designed. Modjoul app wouldn\'t allow check in. Modjoul and ring app were paramount to me. Amazon music app worked fine.Bluetooth worked well.Cons:After 5 months ring tone and vibration stopped working. I didn\'t know i had an incoming call unless I was looking at display. The font size is so small on apps that you can\'t read without Superman laser vision. What good is app if you can\'t see fonts to engage?. If you want to view contents of watch you have to turn head at an uncomfortable angle or remove watch from arm. It should have come with a detachable face, so you could remove and replace to band as needed.I did download an apk which allowed me to use the my garage app.Bottom line is this:If you\'re buying this watch to replace your phone, save your money. It\'s not ready for prime time.If you\'re only looking for a watch that makes and receives calls, this is for you. But, if that\'s all you need, there are cheaper watch phones that will achieve that endI purchased to replace my cell phone which I still must carry for access to certain apps. Now I have 2 phones........""Jeez Louise""', 'One of my husbands coworkers recommended this smart watch to my him... We have been thinking of purchasing our 12-year-old his first phone. And since my husband is always losing his phone at work, We decided to give our son my husbands Samsung galaxy, and he converted to this. Strapped to his wrist.. he can’t lose it!There really is nothing on the market quite like it that we could find, to price shop. So we took his coworkers word for it, and ordered it.My husband has been using it now for two weeks, and his only regret is not converting sooner.Yes It’s BIG! But it performs amazingly. Every app that my husband used on his phone,  he has no problems using on this watch.. It’s amazingly light weight considering it’s size.. Making it surprisingly comfortable. the high definition screen is amazingly vivid and picture perfect!!Battery life is pretty good, it compares to a typical new smartphone in this aspect ..he is constantly on this device. Literally 24 hours a day. And it is holding up well. He works in construction so it gets a lot of abuse..overall very happy with this smart watch, The  fitness tracking capabilities are also accurate and easy to use as well, an added bonus!!Highly recommended! Totally worth the price!', 'After watching reviews after review, after buying this watch. I now got it perfectly as I want it to be. Also does NOT work with Tmobile or Verizon, works with Speedtalk you can also buy here on Amazon.The screen is big and bright, plenty of apps you can use some you cannot. Youtube works on it, Amazon Video does not. Its basically a phone on your wrist works great with Google Maps and other google services.Worth the price honestly, and the battery life is amazing leaving the screen on all day and by the time im home its 80% so major sellpoint in keeping it.Now it takes some knowledge to get it exactly the way you want it, and I high recommend youtube videos as thos watch has been out for 2years it seems. So, buy it enjoy it cause I sure am', 'SIMを別で買わないと使えない', ""It's an interesting phone.  It runs a full version of Android which is good and bad.  Wanna watch YouTube!  No problem.  Wanna stay in fb?  No problem.  Wanna play some games?  No problem.Wanna get a text message?  Uh oh.  Houston we have a problem.  As the watch is essentially a cellphone [lite], it won't pair with a real cellphone as other phones do to send and receive calls and texts.  However, it has its own sim card if you're going to an amusement park or other place where you might be afraid to lose or damage your phone.It's a bit bulky, but let's be honest, you wouldn't but it if it wasn't (having the large screen and all the amenities if having a cell phone on your wrist).Honestly would be a 5-star rating except for the calling/text issue.  Their support staff is slow to respond and tend to avoid the direct question. And it literally took me hours to figure out that it was the Android on Android issue preventing me from issuing it like a normal smart watch...Developers, if you read this, I think you need to work on a software patch for this issue, thanks. Is really like to be able to look at my watch and see that my cellphone got a text message.""]"

This is my second garmin watch, the data collection is very intuitive and works well with my android phone.Concerns I had getting this specific watch: size and color (it\'s orange afterall). I am not a big boned person, I am 5\'2"" with fairly small wrists. I do no think the size of this watch is too big and I wear it everywhere and all the time. It is sort of big and a little bulky but the pros and functionality outweighs any size concerns.  I obviously have the orange version, it\'s a great color and almost acts like a neutral in my wardrobe it\'s weird how that works out but it does. I work in a professional work environment and wear this watch everyday and I don\'t feel like it detracts from my wardrobe look.Functionality: the solar charging is phenomenal, we are outside on the lake most of year, kayaking and paddleboarding, in the 6 months I have owned this watch I have only needed to charge it with wall charger 3 times, all the other charging has been solar. I love that a single charge can get 26-28 days of use. I don\'t use alot of sports or GPS tracking on a daily basis. I track my steps, sleep, weight (myfitness pal to my renpro scale hack), when I do track sports I love that it syncs to strava. I love the gps map for my paddling on the lake. I like that I get my basic notifications from my smartphone like phone calls and text messages- you can\'t respond to texts but I don\'t need to from my watch, the trade off is the long battery life. This watch also works great for linking to wahoo cycling accessories for my indoor cycling data, which again will sync to strava.This watch is a great fitness tracker and I know I am not using it to it\'s fullest abilities but that\'s perfectly fine with me. Garmin is a superior fitness device and this watch is a great option in their lineup.', ""I have been using the Garmin Instinct Solar for at least a couple years. I wear it daily and these are some of the things I've found out about it both good and bad.Pros:Color is sharp and it fits great. Does not look too big and bulky on my wrist.Lots of 'widgets' to use. Some are very useful such as message alerts, being able to control song play from my wrist, weather, and Navigational trackers as well as a few others.Once synced with your phone it alerts you to calls, messages, and events on your calanderI really like the GPS feature that maps your route with activities such as hiking, running, biking. When you go to the app and view your route it is very accurate. I have used it mountain biking and you can actually see the small changes in the different loops you rode.Battery life is great. Typically I am using the watch to track a workout in the morning and then just it's daily functions. I've been averaging about 24 days of battery life. That will be less the more you use the tracking features.Set up and widgets are somewhat customizable. You can have the ones you use available to scroll through or just leave them off the interface if you don't use them. Cuts down on clutter when cycling through the widgets you're looking for.Cons:With all of the different widgets, there are a number that I find useless and generally could care less about. These include sunrise/sunset times, moon phases, altimeter, barometer, and temperature. Some people may find more benefits with these. But for where I live and what I've been using the watch for, these are never used.The activity tracker is limited. Especially the strength tracker. The idea is that when wearing the watch it is supposed to be able to 'sense' the movement you are doing for reps and sets. I have found that 9 times out or 10 it has no idea what strength movement you are doing, especially if it is any complex movement, and the rep count is always inaccurate . You can fix the rep and set count on the watch but this takes way too much time and effort and I've resorted to just tracking calories on the cardio tracker.The trackback or breadcrumb feature is hard to follow on the small watch face. This feature allows you to set a start point (say if you're hiking) and then when you want to return to your starting location it will either take you back the way you came (breadcrumb) or just give you a straight route back to your starting point. I tried this breadcrumb feature out on the trail and I found that if the trail has a lot of switchbacks or quick direction changes it's really hard to determine your route back. The watch face is so small that all the direction changes get smashed down and it's just hard to interpret. I feel this function would work way better if you are making very few direction changes.Overall, I generally like and enjoy the watch. I use the tracking widgets as much as I can and take all of the feedback and stats it gives me with a grain of salt. Would I buy this watch again when it comes time for a new one, I doubt it. Will probably look into a different brand or model."", 'Does everything I need it to, which is mainly heart rate monitoring and telling the time obviously. I do bump it a bunch but it shows no signs of wearing out!', 'It is a great watch promising excellent battery life. If it has what you need for activity apps and usage, it may be for you. Here are two reasons I returned it and exchanged it via Amazon for the Fenix Pro 6x. One, the breadcrumb tracking on the Instinct is OK, but just OK. It shows a track, and that is about it. You can set the Pan/Zoom from .2 miles at a minimum to infinity(?) as a max, but at say, 2 miles the display is small enough as to render the perspective very small, and a .2 miles I question its usefulness, after all, I can see that far most of the time. So I went with the Fenix because it has actual mapping and the display is much larger. On the much touted battery life because of the solar charging (see any online review, written or on YouTube) and this is the strong point, and it was for me too in making the purchase. But here is the caveat. Solar charging only works outside, and in bright sunlight (True, you can set the battery saver in different modes (as you can in the Fenix non-solar) to extend the battery life beyond belief. But that does limit your app use. And, if you live in PA like I do, and 5 months out of the year at least you are wearing sleeves, then what usefulness is the solar charging? Watch the video reviews. These are all done outdoors in places where there is abundant outdoor sunshine. Add to that the fact that where I do most of my hiking, under tree cover, and again the solar charging becomes much less of a sales point for me in my location, or any other location where I might travel to hike (think Glacier National, the Black Hills, Appalachian National Forest, New Hampshire, etc.). Also, when just doing my normal walks in bright sun the solar is only a benefit about half the time because the watch needs to be facing the sun - so when walking in a direction when the watch is on the shaded arm - well, you get my point. In sum, the solar charging would really only benefit me mainly in the summer, when doing fairly long bicycle rides. And that has become a lesser activity for me at this time in my life anyway. Other than that, it is a fine device for what it is designed to do, if it suits your needs. But I felt that I could get a much better device with real mapping, the Fenix 6, without a very usable function for me, the solar charging, at not too much more (if you call a couple hundred dollars not too much!) money, and just stick with connected charging. Thanks for reading.', 'I bought this as an upgrade from my Forerunner 45 (now being used by the wife).The user interface is the same as are pretty much all Garmin wrist devices. One noticeable difference is the 45 has VO2 max and the Instinct doesn\'t. However, the Instinct has blood oxygen which the 45 doesn\'t. Even though the accuracy and usefulness of either of these data are questionable, I would prefer VO2 max over blood oxygen. Given the price difference between these two devices, it seems to me that Gamin could have included both on the Instinct.I only wear the Instinct for running, HR monitoring while paired with a Garmin cycling head unit and weight training (not a super useful feature for me but since it\'s on the watch, I use it). Otherwise, it sits on my window shelf getting full sun in the morning. I charged it with the cable as soon as I unboxed it but never since. The battery indicator shows ""days"" available. I\'ve seen it as high as ""39 days"" remaining. A 1 hour run using GPS will, more or less, knock off 1 ""day"".The watch is lightweight and comfortable. As usual for Garmin, the screen doesn\'t wash out in full sun. Actually it\'s easier to see in full sun.If you are in the Garmin ecosystem, you are already familiar with the mobile app. It works quite well for syncing after a workout and for glancing at your stats. But, the Garmin connect website is much easier to use and has more detail. Keeping track of equipment is very useful to me since you can set default items to specific equipment (running shoes for running, tire life for cycling...). If you have an instance of not using the default equipment (for example, using your old running shoes on a rainy day), you can edit that in the workout stats.Overall, I\'m happy with this purchase.', ""Peu importe l'usage que vous souhaitez faire avec une montre intelligente, cette montre peut tout faire.La montre est pas fait cheap, le design est superbe et elle est confortable à porter.

The extended battery time adds value and the solar charging is effective though ensure to end the activity to shut down tracking. Garmin support to date has been excellent and the software is considerate and well defined.  You will have to learn to resync if connection is lost, and a handy reminder, remove the watch from the app settings before you resync.

I could not get email alerts to connect. I went back to my normal timex watch. I don’t like being told to get off my butt all the time nor do I need all the notifications. This watch is excellent for the price but I don’t need a smart watch.', 'For the price I’ve paid, you can’t beat this piece. My wife loved it', 'The one thing my girlfriend complained about was that on days where she put on her watch later on in the day, it did not sync up her steps from her health app on I phone onto the watch. She went through the Timex app to sync it, & once synced, nothing was updated. She makes sure to wear it as soon as she wakes up in order to make sure that the steps are counted for that day.Besides that issue of not having the health app and Timex app synced, she loves the watch. She loves seeing the blue circle around the watch screen and trying to get it filled each day. In the app, you can set an exact amount for the step goal. Default was 4K, she changed it to 5k. (Blue circle represents steps taken that day- red is calories).She also has an alarm for when she has to take her meds. Often she doesn’t have her phone on her, so the watch is a good way for her to remember in the middle of the day. This is also beneficial for text messages. She often does not carry her phone on her because she either has no pockets or her pockets are too small. With the watch, even if her phone is far away, she will be notified of the text on her watch. She may not respond right away, but at least she sees it.She tested out the battery life. It lasted around 3-3.5 weeks on one charge. She likes that the watch screen only activated when she brings her wrist up. You can have it set to 24-7, but it would drain the battery faster (she hasn’t tested it yet, but is not interested in having the watch on 24-7). The watch will let you know when it is low on battery, so be mindful and charge it every couple weeks.She had never worn watched before, but she was very happy with this one. The interface is easy to use after messing around with all the functions. Also, it takes about 20 seconds for it to read heart rate & you do not have to have the watch on super tight for it to work (lesson learned).NOTE: if you set an alarm, you have to hold one of the 2 buttons down for almost 5 seconds. She thought clicking it once would deactivate it, and the watch vibrated every 10 minutes for an hour and a half for the first few days. She was livid (funny) until she realized that the buttons must be held down for a long time to deactivate the alarm.', 'UPDATE: While I still generally like the watch as a WATCH, I\'m becoming quite disappointed in the fitness /health side of the watch. Over the last few weeks I\'ve noticed that the ""motion"" technology is lacking. It\'s told me I had to get up and move several times when I\'m doing something like making dinner, my step count is lower than normal and it doesn\'t always recognize when I am awake and moving at night to go to the bathroom (ie, last night it said I was never awake, when I did get up once to go to the bathroom). Really disappointed with this. Will keep using it for now as I\'m not doing a lot of hiking and such but once I resume ""normal"" life (or when I get a watch that is as nice for day to day wear that is better as a Smartwatch) this will be put in the watch drawer for occasional use going out. Docking another star.... 3 stars for the watch... as a WATCH.Timex did what it does best and blended their expertise in watch technology and design with the best of the current Smartwatch technologies. That said, there\'s still ""room for improvement"".First off, this thing is the nicest looking smartwatch I\'ve ever had. To the point I\'m afraid to wear it because I do a lot of DIY and gardening. So I may come back an report how it holds up to those challenges.Upon opening I turned it on and it was just over half charged. The charger is one of the magnetic type of USB cords that you need to supply the USB adapter for. It took maybe around an hour to complete the charging.Next was uploading the Timex Smart App ... (You will also be directed to download the Google Fit App... at this point I haven\'t figured out how that will help me and it\'s not syncing with the Timex App... I need to look into this further but it\'s not a deal breaker for me.). The Timex App directs you through the whole process of set-up and syncing. I have to say it took a few tries to get the phone and watch to sync (Finally re-booted the phone and that worked). The App helped me trouble shoot that issue, which was nice.Next is going through all the settings to make the watch work for YOU. One thing I\'m finding is helping me to tweak this is the manual you can download on the Timex website (just search Metropolitan R and the link pops up). I\'ve *almost* got it perfect for me.Things I love:The fact that I can READ it even when outside ... even smaller writing like the text push notifications. For these 59 yr old eyes, this is HUGE.Text and other push notifications. Not having to get my phone out when I hear the text notification until I quickly check the watch to see if it\'s something important has already saved me a lot of aggravation. Make sure to check that you enabled the text, FB, or whatever app in the ""App Alerts"" settings on the phone.Did I say the EASY READ dial? There are other options for clock faces but I\'m sticking with the original.Touchscreen that helps you to instinctively find what you need. Swype left or right for more detailed info on heartrate and steps. Swype up for the menu of various options like Activity, Heartrate, Workouts, Weather, Notification settings, Alarms, Music and ""More"" (Compass, Timer, Countdown, and the **ALL IMPORTANT*** Find Phone). Swype down for things like Auto brightness, Do Not Disturb, and Lock features. I have to reiterate this... the settings are instinctive... at least if you have had any kind of smartwatch. FAR easier to work through than any smartwatch I\'ve had in the past (and I\'ve tried all from the cheap knockoffs to Fitbits and Garmins and the like).At present battery life looks like it will last me 4-5 days depending on how many push notifications I get each week. I\'m good with that.The ONE downer:The Metropolitan does *NOT* run third party apps. So I docked a star for that...nearly docked 2 for it.  ANY smart watch nowadays needs to talk to apps like Map My Run, Strava, Runkeeper, or My Fitness Pal. Too many of us already have used these for years if not decades and some insurances give better rates if you get your daily step count and they get that data from these apps. At this price this is a huge oversight.One odd thing is the issue of ""water resistance"". If you see the description, it says ""Water resistant to 30m (100ft): In general, withstands splashes or brief immersion in water. Not suitable for swimming or bathing"". Uh - if your watch is in 100ft of water, that just a *bit* more than a ""splash""... I\'d err on the side of caution and just avoid water as much as possible with this watch.This watch combines good looks with simple but technologically advanced functionality that should be enough for the regular person on the street who doesn\'t need $500 technology. Would definitely recommend to friends with the caveat that it won\'t talk to their training/health apps. If it had that feature it would be a home run.If anything changes I\'ll come back to update. Happy Shopping!', 'Terrible I was not capable of turning it on', 'love this watch brand new series got to love a actual watch brand making a good solid smart watch.For elderly that are not tech savvy this is perfect its not as sophisticated as a Apple watch in its navigation this is more like a everyones watch the OS is super simple pretty to look at and if my 90 year old grandmother can use this SO CAN YOU!You can disable all notifications to make this less intrusive +battery life increased. For elderly you want a smartwatch that tells you your heart rate sleep tracking nothing will make you confused is so simple to control!', ""I spent ages looking for the right watch and finally chose this, being very excited to receive it.Couldn't have been more disappointed; the magnetic charger repelled and so wouldn't work, the app to install wasn't recognised so I've sent it back. I did contact Timex for support before doing so but was simply directed to the seller which I thought was very poor."", 'It takes a licking but keeps on ticking!', 'I\'ve had an Apple Watch for 3 years and wanted something different. This watch isn\'t as ""high tech"" as the Apple Watch, but does what I need/used the most...receiving notifications (although can\'t respond) and fitness tracking.

It doesn’t the flair or most of the features of the Apple Watch, and instead only has a few. Fortunately, the ones it has are the only ones I care about…so I love this watch.Pros:Not expensive compared to Apple Watch.It looks and feels much more like a regular watch, and isn’t crazy heavy or bulky looking.I got a leather band that makes it feel even less smart watch like.The battery life is fantastic, I set the heart rate monitor to 1m intervals for sleep tracking etc and it still lasts for a week on a charge.Text alerts are simple and solid for what they are.Workout tracking is good enough for me, but I’m really only into that for walks/runs/steps.Cons:Could use a bit more watch face customization, that’s really what’s missing for 5 stars IMO.The app is a little wonky sometimes and doesn’t load things right away.There’s an option for an always on screen, what confuses me about that is the screen that’s always on is a specific one…and not your watch face. So you see the Time on the always on face and press the button, only to see your chosen watch face showing the time.

Battery, -2. Accuracy 3.My biggest complaint is that as a health monitor, I\'m not impressed at all. I originally purchased to track my sleep. Well, it fails pretty miserably. Logs start time correctly about 20% of the time. If you\'re prone to using the restroom in the middle of the night, you will not be pleased. Last night I woke up at 1:30 am, used the restroom and when I checked my stats, it showed that my sleep was consider complete even though I went back to sleep for an additional 5 hours.This is not a once off. Been using nightly for just a few days under a month now and there has only been 3 nights where the result were even close to reality. Sure you can edit your data to replace those missed hours, but the defeats the point and those edits do not assist as they don\'t count for sleep stages.A few pro\'s:1. It keeps time well.Ok, that\'s about it for the pros.Battery life is tolerable at best. If you turn pretty much everything off, you may get through a day, but if you use the features that actually make this watch different from a ""normal"" watch you\'re lucky to get 8 hours, and that\'s being kind.I could easily live with the short battery life as I do not use this as a daily wearer but just to track sleep and eventually walking (had reconstructive foot surgery).If you\'re thinking about using it as your daily and would like to actually run the features be prepared to have it die before your day is over.I\'m going to keep it anyway. Aestheticlly it is a very nice watch. There are limited downloadable faces, most of which are pretty ugly (to me at least) but a few are quite nice. Has a great feel. Heavy, but not obnoxiously so. Sleek and nice to look at. OLED is *black* when screen is off and is very good looking and with the high resolution, even text alerts sent to the face are easily readable.In summation, it\'s a 6 out of 10. A 3 for functionality and a 9.5 for form.I\'m going to wait 3 more years or so and give the whole ""smart watch"" thing another try.Just wish it would know when I\'m sleeping and know when I\'m awake.....', ""Very nice watch, band was a little narrower than I had expected but Im a pretty big guy so I guess that makes sense. Bought this so I can read my text messages at work and count my steps. Does both of those things well, but doesn't have the features of other smart watches (message reply etc). Can however control your media, so if you are say listening to music while your phone is in your bag, then the boss walks in, you can pause it which is great.Also keeps track of steps taken, total distance walked and heart rate which is nice to have, and seems to have some programmable workout stuff which I havent played with but seems good.This thing has also helped me realize how awful my sleep habits are.All in all, great value for the money, great looking, and mine has survived some decent knocks against concrete floors and walls so reasonably durable."", 'Received the watch on Friday Apr 29th.

I haven’t activated any App alerts or heartbeat monitoring, settings are all default. Maybe I got a dud.Got a replacement watch from Amazon and the battery appears to be good, almost 24 hrs after full charge battery only down 5% to 95%. So first watch I received was definitely faulty.', ""I really enjoy the watch, the band is horrible after one week it's warping and digging into my wrist, I wouldn't recommend the majority of the different watch faces they are really unappealing to the eye, not to mention there is a moon phase watch face that doesn't change with the time of day so it's always on the moon, very unimpressed with the presentation.Battery life is incredible, the heart rate and calories seem to be accurate.Anyway thanks for reading have a nice day."", '1st this is not an Apple watch.  The apple watch is a completely different device, basically an extension of your iPhone. That is why I switch to the Timex.I have an apple watch and I am simply tired of the daily charging, the heavyness and the fear that I will drop it and break it (Which I already have done) with how expensive they are.Come in the Timex! I just want the time, sleep tracking, workout tracking and the occasional notifications. This watch does all of that while being lighter and more wallet friendly. Also with out the display on I can get almost 2 weeks of battery life. With the always on display I get about 5 days.The battery life was the biggest selling point for me. I was able to take my fully charged Timex on a 4 day backpacking trip and track my hike, with out the display on, and I still had over 50% battery life left when we got back to the car.If you are looking for a reasonably priced smart watch that looks like a watch, with decent battery life, decent app and notifications. This is a great choice.Only changes to the watch have been changing the strap to a velcro strap, did not like the leather one. I also added a cheap screen protector to it.', 'I bought this ""smart watch"" to participate in my health insurance/life insurance health and fitness programs. Unfortunately, due to it\'s inaccuracy I cannot recommend this device as a fitness tracker. As oppose to lowering my rates by keeping track of healthy activities, reporting these false stats from the watch would invariably RAISE my rates due to numbers putting me in the ""At Risk"" area. As I sit here writing this review it has my heart rate at 138 bpm. When I manually take my pulse, it is 71 bpm. When working out, it is off by about 20-40 bpm, even putting having me outside of my Max heart rate. This is unacceptable.Things I like:  - Slim design. Looks very good. Lite, almost don\'t even know its on wrist.  - Has custom watch faces.  - Good battery life.Things I don\'t like:  - Inaccurate Heart monitor.  - Inaccurate GPS. Takes about 1-2 minutes to acquire a satellite for tracking.  - Overlaying GPS tracks over Google maps basically has me jumping off bridge.  - The app is not well integrated. If I start my activity from the app, it does start on the watch. You must start app on watch to get fitness tracking.Also, once a workout is started from the watch, the watch is locked out of other features until you stop the workout. So if you get a notification and miss it, well you can\'t retrieve it until you stop the workout. Or if you need to use the stop watch feature to record your actual heart rate, you can\'t access that feature until you stop the workout.I took advice from others online and purchased a cheap Yamay fitness tracker to see if it would do the things I need before spending on more expensive choices. The YAMAY, did what I was looking for so I took a chance on upgrading to the Metropolitan R. Unfortunately it was actually a downgrade in function. I cannot recommend this watch to track anything health related.']"

Down 7% in just 4 hours, I wasn't even wearing it!"", ""Yes, the Times Ironman R300 looks like 1980's retro chic. Yet to me I am drawn to it and really enjoy wearing it. The comfort is great and it is so light. Then there is the amazing battery life. I am on day 5 with a 45 minute run everyday and it is at 90% battery life. The screen is on par with Garmin's Vivoactive series and it is brighter than Polar and Coros so I am fine. It is not the screen of an Apple Watch and it meant to be great in sunlight and to be battery efficient. I find the heart rate tracking to be so accurate and sleep is pretty good as well. As a marathon distance runner this has exactly what I am looking for and the half and full marathon training plans from great marathoners like Jared Ward and other tirathaletes make this great. You can also build your own workouts in the app to be uploaded to the watch. Overall this is a great effort from Timex and I look forward to small improvements. My only concern it Amazfit it the 3rd party provider and I am not so sure about their privacy policy and that is a concern of mine. However Amazfit make this watch software and battery life possible and on par with Coros."", ""EDITED: My first review was a bit sharp, i'm sorry, i've been stuck in quarantine for a month now and I was really excited to receive this product.The goodAt first the watch is tricky to get used to. There is a little learning curve to find the setting to turn off the alert sounds that sound like tamagochi. The hardware is killer. I have had this on for 3 weeks, I have done 15x4mi runs with GPS with HR every second switched on and its still at 35%. I can see it in the brightest of sunlight, by far the best screen in the industry. The data is very easy to read when running or cycling. The sleep tracking has been very insightful and the app presents the data well. I like the little tips that tell me my metabolism is messed up because I went to bed too late.The watch is surprisingly more comfortable than my casio classic! The UI is good not to let you inadvertently hit buttons while running/climbing. Its a little uncomfortable at first to have the strap tight on your wrist to get accurate HR but you get used to it and its nice it expands when your BP increases the diameter of your wrist when running. I have already inadvertently hit the face of the watch on metal objects and stuff that would scratch or smash and apple watch and its still perfect. This is defiantly the best watch for me right now especially at this price point. It feels right.The badThe UI is ok. It's really nice to have it so simple and I can see where they're coming from stripping away all the garbage on an apple watch. The worst part of the UI is the music sync which has a mind of its own. Firstly it only lets you control the music on your phone when the specific music app is open and your phone is unlocked. This makes it almost useless. It will say a song is running when its not and delay playing and pausing. Its nice to have the weather on your wrist but it doesn't tell you what the current conditions are just today's highs and lows. It'd be nice to have what the current temperature and conditions are.The running and cycling are great but the other section could do with some work. I tried doing some weights and the watch wouldn't start because I didn't move. There's basically no functionality for doing any other workout including swimming, surfing, sailing which I would love to see and upload to strava. It'd be killer with those features.I think the hardware design would be better if it didn't have ironman written all over it. I don't think partnerships should have their logos as the main aesthetic of the watch. Keep it simple and remove the co-branding I just like TIMEX. I'd like to see more watch bands available without ironman. There is a very limited number of watch faces. I'd like to see more in the future with current temperature included.The uglyHaving to sync manually all the time is a real pain. Please fix this and have it automatically sync if possible. Fix the music and weather app. Looking forward to software V2. The hardware is great. The software needs dialing and tweaking and I think this could be a real hit. Just get the software right. You're nearly there.Big fan TIMEX, keep it up and keep tweaking this!"", ""*** Edit: As of the 1.1.4 update in July 2020, battery life for me had doubled to 2+ weeks under the exact same usageI wore a pebble for years and in so many ways it was my perfect watch. After they sold to Fitbit and my watch finally stopped working I switched to an Amazfit Bip. While it wasn't as perfect it was good enough. When I found Timex released a watch, the Ironman R300, that was Huami/Amazfit under the hood I figured it was worth a shot.**Features*** Always on display* 4 Physical buttons (Note: only one can be configured for long-press app launch)* Responsive touchscreen (Must click a button to activate, so no accidental input)* Touchscreen can be set to disable during workouts so sweat/water won't interfere with touchscreen* Alarms (3 programmable alarms)* Countdown timer, chronograph* Multitasking - you can back out of a timer/activity and use other apps (This is not true of the Bip/Back to my glory days of running down the battery because I forget to turn off the stop watch for days!)* 50M water resist* Automatic HR and Sleep tracking (optional)* Steps/Calories/Goal tracking* Playback control looks almost identical to pebble (as I remember it). Track advance/back, volume up/down, play/resume* Onboard GPS + sports tracking (Far superior to Pebble or Amazfit Bip making this a solid running/cycling watch)* Syncs with Strava and Runkeeper (I use Tapiirik to sync/backup since I don't usually use either of those. This is fine.)* App allows for pretty advanced workout/training configuration with some presets included - this really surprised me!* App notifications* Basic weather (current temp, future high/lows)* 1-2 wks battery - I get about a week. That's with notifications on, 30 min automatic HR and Sleep Tracking enabled, and 3 or so tracked workouts with GPS. I could see you easily getting 2+ weeks out of it if you favored battery life over features and were more conservative with your settings.* App sync is always fast, doesn't have the long aGPS sync like some watches I've seen**Cons** *Coming from a Pebble perspective** Notifications don't stay on screen very long and are not actionable. You can always find them in the notification area, but I know for some folks persistent notifications are a deal breaker.* Notifications are not actionable, they're read-only. Based on other Huami products, I do not expect this to change.* Limited watch face selection, and so far no third party community support. (I could see this changing if enough of us buy this watch, it's basically an Amazfit watch and the app is a re-branded upgrade of Mi-Fit.* No third party apps**Other thoughts**This is a great watch for me. I do like the design, and it has all the features that I was really looking for. Overall I'm very happy with it, I do hope more watch faces are forthcoming either first or third party.The biggest surprise to me is how great a *sports* watch it is. Coming from the Bip, I expected that to be an afterthought - especially for the price. In that way, I got more than I bargained for.The design of this thing is. . . distinct. If you like it you like it, if you don't you don't. I think the darker colors are less distinct, if you don't love the design go with black. If I had to describe it I'd say this is what you get when you hire the Back to the Future props team in 1985 to design this year's TIMEX watch.*** Edit: As of the 1.1.4 update in July 2020, battery life for me had doubled to 2+ weeks under the exact same usage"", ""Easy to setup. Battery life after first full charge was amazing. I did not like the fact that the face isn't scratch resistant."", 'I bought this watch primarily to track heart rate and GPS position for running, walking and cycling. I owned a Garmin Fenix 5-series watch for about a month before this (returned because it was too huge on the wrist and created pressure points during activity) -- that context forms the basis for evaluation.PROS:-very light-unbeatable price for the features-excellent GPS performance-great battery life-integrates with StravaCONS:-heart rate monitoring accuracy is painfully inconsistent-clunky Timex Smart app-ugly watchface choices with limited customization options  The specs and pricepoint of the Timex were appealing so I took the dive. Immediate impressions were good, despite some frustration learning to use the watch UI and downloaded smartphone app. There is also a bit of learning curve to figuring out how to effectively use the watch to match the types of exercise that you do. However the watch wears well and you barely notice it on your wrist, particular compared to some of the macho-huge products of other companies.  Where the watch falls flat is the accuracy of the heart rate monitoring. During both mountain and road cycling, the heart rate monitoring does not work consistently. At the beginning of one my local rides I start with a moderate climb, and my heart rate (measured manually) ramps up pretty quickly to ~ 120 bpm ... the Timex is still measuring 90 bpm max despite having crested the climb and started a descent on the other side. Perhaps this is a sampling latency issue but in looking at ride data later, the watch stays pegged there despite significant subsequent climbing on the bike. When I review the ride data from a Garmin Fenix 5X (ride data obtained on different days) there is a very clear and consistent correlation between increase in heart rate and elevation gain. Unfortunately I do not see this same consistency with the Timex. I have had rides where the HR was pegged below 100 bpm for over an hour which was completely incorrect. I have tried readjusting the watch, moving it to a different location on my wrist, changing the tightness of the band, making sure the OHRM lens was clean, all to no avail.  I have pored over all available reviews on the internet to see if others have experienced this -- and no one seems to mention this outside of their assessment of the intrinsic limitations of wrist-based OHRM technology. However, I have to believe that there is either a limitation in the implementation of this technology in the Timex device (because devices of other manufacturers did not display such a huge discrepancy) or that I have a defective device.  The pricepoint of the Timex means that there will be inevitable compromises (as seen with the software, app, and watch UI) but I think the OHRM inaccuracy during activity veers close to dealbreaker status. Heart rate monitoring is one of the primary functions of a device like this, and it does not do it well. If the OHRM was more consistently accurate, this would be a 5-star device but in its current implementation, it is a 3-star device.---Addendum:  Timex reached out to me in response to this review (I posted a similar version of this on their website) and I give them credit for reading the reviews and attempting to help:-They reiterated wearing the watch snugly and at least one fingerbreadth above the wrist bone.-They go one to say:  ""During biking there is significant wrist flexing, which makes it difficult for an optical heart rate sensor to accurately measure heart rate.  We advise moving the watch much further above the wrist for optimal performance while biking. Moving it to halfway between the wrist and elbow will elminate the vast majority of the wrist motion effect.""', 'Pour l’utilisation que j’en fais, elle me convient parfaitement, je pratique la course en sentieret me donne tout les stats que j’aime avoir.', ""I really just got the watch for running and for tracking with GPS. I have had the watch for 3 months now and ot works perfectly for me.  I charge it about once every two weeks and it doesn't drop below 50% battery with an average of 20 miles GPS runs per week. I wear it constantly and find it easy to use. It is helpful also with keeping track of heart rate which is something I haven't done before. I do notice that it seems a little unaccurate at time when I sweat a lot, but overall nice. The app could use some work, but it synchronizes with Strava nicely. I fond the GPS to be very accurate which is the main reason why I got the watch. Overall this is the best watch for $120. I highly recommend this product!"", 'I use this watch everyday! Great tool to have on a daily basis.']"

Spedizione e consegna da parte di Amazon, come sempre, ineccepibili. Arrivato circa 10 giorni fa, lo recensisco dopo un utilizzo continuo. La confezione è minimale e resistente. Contiene l'orologio, il cavo di ricarica e il libretto delle istruzioni, anche in italiano. Premetto che, ricaricato appena arrivato, ad oggi ha ancora il 72% di carica, anche se, come dirò, tengo tutte le impostazioni al minimo. Esteticamente si presenta davvero bene. Bellissimo nella sua mimetica, leggerissimo, anche se da un forte senso di robustezza, comodo da indossare. Il quadrante è davvero bello. Le istruzioni sono ridotte all'osso, ma basta avere un po' di dimestichezza e si fa tutto in autonomia. Attraverso il qr code si scarica l'app dedicata, ben fatta e intuitiva, mediante la quale si gestisce l'orologio in tutte le sue caratteristiche: scelta del quadrante, settaggio delle notifiche, ecc. Dopo l'avvio iniziale occorre attendere qualche minuto per dare modo all'orologio di aggiornarsi, dopo di che diventa pienamente operativo. Ha il gps, che rileva la posizione e fornisce i dati meteo nella zona. Io ho impostato le sole notifiche per le chiamate in entrata. ma si possono impostare per tutte le app di messaggistica. Per quanto riguarda l'utilizzo sportivo, c'è da premettere che non è un prodotto professionale. Tuttavia fa bene il tuo dovere L'ho utilizzato nei miei allenamenti in palestra, e fornisce dati utili quali il monitoraggio del battito cardiaco e le calorie consumate. Unico neo, ma per me è molto importante, il calcolo della distanza percorsa dal contapassi. Evidentemente considera un passo di circa 80 cm, davvero eccessivo, tant'è che su 4000 passi riporta una distanza coperta superiore a 3 km. Ripeto, è un dato eccessivo e facilmente confutabile. Non sono riuscito a trovare il modo per modificare l'impostazione sulla lunghezza dei passi, temo non ci sia. Questo è un errore che altri smartwatch molto più semplici ed economici non commettevano. I parametri personali, quali età, altezza, peso, ecc. sono facilmente impostabili. Le 4 stelle sono dovute al discorso della distanza calcolata. Se la cosa dovesse essere corretta con un futuro firmware, o se dovessero implementare in modo da poter modificare la distanza dei passi, per me le 5 stelle sono più che meritate."", ""j'ai enfin trouvé mon bonheur ;)"", 'Iniziamo col dire che ho acquistato questo smart(sport?)watch dopo aver letto parecchio ed essermi documentato. Provengo da un Amazfit Neo acquistato per curiosità e poichè mi è piaciuto l\'ecosistema Amazfit (e relativa app ZEPP) mi sono deciso all\'acquisto, apprezzando particolarmente il design che ricorda molto i G-Shock della Casio. L\'orologio è davvero ben costruito, leggerissimo rispetto alla sua ""mole"" e mantiene le promesse riguardo alla solidità ed alla resistenza. L\'interfaccia e il software utilizzati sono intuitivi e di facile navigazione: si riesce ad impostare tutto sin da subito con estrema semplicità. Molto bello lo schermo amoled, reattivo il touch, che non mostra impuntamenti o imprecisioni. Buona la gestione delle notifiche. Per quanto riguarda il monitoraggio delle attività sportive, l\'ho provato sia all\'aperto (running) che al chiuso (palestra, utilizzando l\'allenamento ""esercizio""): nessun problema per quanto riguarda il gps, preciso e veolce nall\'agganciare il segnale, altreattanto affidabile al chiuso nel monitorare l\'attività fisica. Sarebbe da 5 stelle per il rapporto qualità/prezzo (io l\'ho preso a poco più di 80€), ma manca la misurazione dell\'ossigeno e dello stress e le attività monitorabili sono pochine, soprattutto in confronto alla serie Bip U (decisamente economica ma più recente). Ultima annotazione riguardo alla batteria, davvero infinita per uno smartwatch (parliamo di almeno un paio di settimane con quasi tutto attivo, monitoraggio del sonno compreso).', ""Had this watch about 2 months and use it daily.

Le due stelle vanno all'aspetto alla qualità del display, per il lato sportivo lo considero un dispositivo deludente.GPS: forse idoneo a percorsi in campagna, o lontano dalle case, ma in città soffre parecchio, si sgancia facilmente passando sotto piccoli cavalcavia, nei numerosi test di confronto col gps di 2-3 cellulari ho riscontrato differenze anche di 200-300 metri. Delle volte impazzisce e ti segna mezzo km di strada inventata.Cardiofrequenzimetro: i sensori di frequenza da polso già per natura  sono una tecnologia inaccurata a causa anche delle numerose variabili disturbanti come peluria, sudore, cinturino piu' o meno stretto, ecc. ma con questo Gts si superano i limiti. Da fermi misura bene, durante l'attività fisica devi sperarlo. Nel confronto con la rilevazione fatta portando le dita al collo, capita spesso che le pulsazioni risultino sovrastimate o sottostimate rispetto a quelle reali. Un clamoroso bug mai risolto impedisce la rilevazione corretta della frequenza in bicicletta praticamente sempre con valori che rimangono bassissimi.Passi: abbastanza precisi nel calcolo durante la registrazione delle attività come camminata e corsa, ne aggiunge 2 o 3 ogni volta che mi fermo ma nel totale abbastanza corrispondenti. Male invece nel resto della giornata a causa di quelli inventati durante la guida di bicicletta, auto e monopattino.Software: in generale lo smartwatch soffre di numerosi bug, alcuni risolti durante i vari aggiornamenti sia pure con molto ritardo, altri mi accompagneranno fino alla dipartita finale dato che a distanza di quasi due anni non c'è piu' supporto. C'è il sistema PAI che attraverso un punteggio accumulato fornisce un'indicazione del livello di attività fisica da mantenere ma si basa sulla rivelazione della frequenza cardiaca e quindi è a sua volta inaffidabile.Lasciamo perdere il lato notifiche, sonno e altro, sennò mi dilungo troppo nelle critiche.Conclusione:  è bello, lo tengo al polso da 2 anni, quasi ininterrottamente.

I was having to charge it more than once a day in its last month and the screen was so damaged it was hard to read. I wanted a fancier version and loved the look of the analog display on the Vivomove 3s.I do love the look of this watch and it has additional features that I like such as the nightly SpO2 readings (although I have access to a real SpO2 monitor and there is about a 4-5% discrepancy to the real measurement, so take it with a grain of salt). However, I find the touch screen MUCH more difficult to access. I find that you have to tap it much more forcefully to activate it, sometimes several times, although the swipe actions are very reactive. I also wish it could be backlit. I am a time checker at night and I liked that I could just gently tap my Vivosmart to light it and look at the time without moving my whole body, but I am really struggling to tap the watch and actually get a response on the Vivomove, prompting me to have to lift my head to check the alarm clock next to my bed. I’m a finicky sleeper to begin with so this is a big disturbance in my sleep pattern and maybe not as big a deal to other people. A light button would allow me to read the analog display without having to double tap unreliably to access the widget options.The battery life is also a fair bit shorter than on my Vivosmart. Whereas I only had to charge it around every 7-10 days, I have to charge the Vivomove 3s every 3-4 days. It has to be charged with the included charger and is not compatible with a wireless charging station.Neither of my watches had wireless charging capabilities and I hope that Garmin incorporates that into some of its models in the future.Overall I think that this is a beautiful watch, certainly the nicest (albeit most expensive) I’ve ever owned. I would 100% buy a Garmin again and hope that by the time I’m in the market for a new watch the issues above have been improved on.', ""This is a very beautiful watch and very easy to use.  It does everything that I need it to do and more.  I am so impressed with the battery life of this watch.  I can go a week without needing to charge it.

It does a lot more that I don\'t really care about.  I\'d take away a quarter star if I could for the move reminder / phone alert ""buzz"".  It is a very soft & brief vibration that is easy to miss if you are in my work environment.  I\'d like the vibration to be stronger & a smidge longer.  Otherwise LOVE LOVE LOVE this hybrid.', ""I got this watch about 4-6 weeks ago and I loved it. It did it's job basically. Even though its waterproof, two week tracking data, long battery life, it fails as a simple watch itself. Around two days ago I actually had to factory reset the watch because it simply would show the wrong time completely. Every time the digital dial comes on, the hands of the watch would move to obviously show the digital display. However, mine stopped changing to the correct time. Every time it happened it would go back to times like 9:15, 15:55, 12:05 even though it was only 2pm. So everytime I lifted my hand, I had an incorrect time.

I also find the Garmin app to be superior to the apps associated with other smartwatches/fitness bands.  Additionally, setup could not have been easier.Since I just received my watch today, I have no information about sleep tracking or battery life.  I'll update this review to add those ratings.Update: I've now had this watch for several weeks.  Frankly, if I still had the packaging I'd return it.  Battery life is okay - 4 to 5 days.  The mobile app provides good info and the watch stays connected without interruption.  I find the sleep tracking pretty inaccurate compared to Fitbit.  It logs me as asleep when I'm sitting quietly working and doesn't recognize that I'm awake when I get up for several hours in the middle of the night.  My biggest complaint is the band.  For me, it's very uncomfortable to sleep in, as it doesn't breathe.  I tried replacement bands of different materials, but they were all too big for my tiny wrists.

Other than those two things it seems to track well and the body battery is very useful!!']"

I have a medium wrist and wonder if 47mm watch would be too big for me but to my surprise, it is perfect and light and also I love the Titanium color which blends so well with my skin.It may not have as many functions and features as the Apple watch but I am content with its simplicity, its Amoled screen display, many watch-faces to choose from and especially its usefulness in Heart rate and Health promotion and motivation.

Battery life isn't as good as the Bip's 30-40 day batter life, but I'm getting about 20 days with no heart rate monitoring.The issues:1) Even with the phone in my pocket and watch on my wrist, I continually get messages saying that the phone is disconnected. I've done everything in the settings to basically ensure that it's not bluetooth trying to save battery or some setting where it tries to close the app.2) The app is VERY inconsistent. It will almost always read that the phone is connected, and it will even show the current battery level, but there are whole weeks where it won't sync any data (sleep tracking, PAI, etc). The only way to fix that is by restarting your phone.I've emailed their customer service and it sounds like I'll have to go through the whole process of rebooting and re-pairing every other day, until they decide to actually fix it."", ""Pros- good quality and display- looks good- ability to change watch facesCons- I wished it had a wheel like the samsung galaxy has, depending on the position that I'm in, I always find my hands hitting the buttons- battery life for how I'm using it lasts for 14 days using the default settings, i thought it would be more- would have wanted some additional monitoring capabilitys like the oxygen monitoring"", ""I put my watch in battery saver mode most of the time for time keeping and steps tracking, only set it in normal mode when I am out walking or running .

For one, why do I have to enable GPS position on my phone in order to connect with the watch?I wish there is a way to disable GPS, I am only interested in heart rate, pace etc when I am running.

However, in this special edition guize, you get a stunner of a fitness watch with decent fitness tracking, a lovely screen, great battery life and quality build. The mocha\\khaki-green color scheme looks great with any outfit and the band is an improvement over the silicone versions on other GTR models. I still like Amazfit's PAI system and updated ZEPP app, and this model adds REM-sleep detection over the smaller older cousins, which was unexpected.

Además era un reloj discreto, pequeño y muy ligero. Bastante más cómodo que un Fenix si usas camisa para trabajar. Además aunque no era barato, me dejaba margen de +120€ respecto a un Fenix 5 que podía imvertir en otro equipamiento deportivo.Durante los 6 meses que lo he usado puedo constatar que sí, que es cómodo, que pesa poco, que la batería dura razonablemente bien en el día a día (toca cargar cada 5-6 días si no usas funciones smart ni has hecho ejercicio). Y ya. Pero eso no vale 200€.Es un reloj de la gama Forerunner, lo que quiere decir que es eminentemente para correr. Pues bien, a la hora de hacer ejercicio y querer conectarse a GPS (o GLONASS o GALILEO), da igual el sitio en el que esté (campo abierto o ciudad en un sitio amplio) que el reloj tarda del orden de 5 minutos en pillar los satélites. En el mejor de los casos 2-3 minutos. Esto con un Fenix no ocurre (salvo defecto de fábrica), No puedo estar cada vez que voy a correr parado no sé el tiempo para pillar los satélites.Por otro lado, la medición de distancia que hace de las carreras varía de un ejercicio a otro. Es bien sabido que la recepción del GPS es mala en días nublados, pero este modelo me ha fallado también en días de sol. Modelos como el 235 o incluso el 225 no fallaban. Y ojo que esto es GARMIN, que nacen sus propios GPS y es el ""core"" de su negocio. Inadmisible...A parte de eso, lo he usado en cinta y bien; mide más o menos la distancia. A cadencias bajas da metros de más (en mi caso unos 30 metros+) y a cadencias altas da metros de menos.También lo he usado para controlar actividades en gimnasio. pero ¡vaya! no puedes cargar entrenamientos...Conclusión: que por 100€ más me vuelvo al Fenix 5 que me da más de lo que necesito, pero sobre todo cumple con los temas imprescindibles. Otra opción hubiera sido el 245 pero no lo tienen en stock...Y si alguien tiene dudas de qué hacer con 180€-200€ que coja el 735XT o el 235. La navegación por pantallas no es tan ágil (procesador más básico) y el acabado no es tan ""bonito"", pero el objetivo deportivo lo cumplen con creces.', 'Ich nutze die Uhr nun seit einigen Jahren und sie läuft immer noch wie am ersten Tag.

The watch is light and no trouble to wear, with a soft rubbery strap that has plenty of adjustment to suit most wrists. It has its own special charger lead, which is short and with a connection I've never seen before. It charges pretty quickly, and lasts 10 hours or so with GPS on (I haven't timed it exactly). There is a battery indicator available on the watch. When switched on, you can start and select from a number of activities (activities can be added or removed in the app). It finds GPS pretty quickly. I only use the time elapsed/distance covered/pace functions, which all clearly show on the face when running. The session can be paused, and is remembered if the watch is switched off. If you have the app, when a session is saved, it will transfer the data to your phone over Bluetooth.

The watch is light and no trouble to wear, with a soft rubbery strap that has plenty of adjustment to suit most wrists. It has its own special charger lead, which is short and with a connection I've never seen before. It charges pretty quickly, and lasts 10 hours or so with GPS on (I haven't timed it exactly). There is a battery indicator available on the watch. When switched on, you can start and select from a number of activities (activities can be added or removed in the app). It finds GPS pretty quickly. I only use the time elapsed/distance covered/pace functions, which all clearly show on the face when running. The session can be paused, and is remembered if the watch is switched off. If you have the app, when a session is saved, it will transfer the data to your phone over Bluetooth.

Este Garmin, a pesar de tener ya unos años y ser relativamente barato, tiene una precisión mucho mayor que la de cualquier pulsera. Y mejor todavía, para situaciones críticas de ejercicio intenso como en el deporte, puede - y debe, yo lo recomiendo - emparejarse con una banda de pecho Polar que es lo más preciso que existe para registrar frecuencia cardíaca.Lo que más me gusta:- en reposo mide contínuamente la frecuencia cardíaca con precisión aceptable, y en deporte se empareja perfectamente con la banda pectoral.- puedes configurar alarmas en las que el reloj te avisa de que has alcanzado un número de pulsaciones peligroso para tu corazón (o al bajar de un número de pulsaciones)Lo que me gusta menos:- si tienes presbicia (vista cansada) te va a costar trabajo leer algunos números de la pantalla... ¿Esto es inevitable? Pues dado el tamaño del display si, pero ciertamente las personas mayores van a encontrarse el problema.- Si eres nuevo con Garmin, la interface y sus menús tienen una curva de aprendizaje, tardas varios días en pillar la lógica. Yo he tardado tres días en conseguir dominar el tema de las alertas. No me considero torpe ni inexperto, pero desde luego el sistema de menús es poco amigable.- la aplicación Garmin Connect me parece horrible, sobrecargada y farragosa. Garmin tiene mucho que aprender de Polar en ese sentido. Todo el tema de medición del sueño, estrés, compartir en redes sociales tus logros, nivel de energía corporal, etc... me parecen chorradas, francamente', ""I don't have any dire criticisms of this watch but some minor criticisms.- Naja/so-so points: -The GPS lock can be a little slow and I've found standing still helps a lot while it searches for your location.It's unfortunate that the Garmin app store shows many apps, which are not compatible with my watch. I only have the Forerunner 45 registered - why not hide the apps, I cannot even use with the device? Probably to remind you that you were too poor to buy the more expensive models, such as the Forerunner 245.Non-standard strap mounting. It uses a proprietary strap connection, which limits strap availability. Luckily I bought a comfortable, aftermarket strap for €15 on Amazon and it fits great... Still, it's a drag that I cannot use regular straps.Sleep tracking is only so-so for me. It records the time I spend trying to sleep as sleep - leading to '11 hours of sleep' which in reality is barely 8 hours of actual sleep.Proprietary power cable. I guess there might be a reason for this but it's a bit of a drag. If it could be made as USB C, it'd make it better in my opinion.Smart watch features are  only so-so. It's nice that they are there but it's not a selling point for this device and it shows. The more expensive Garmin watches can do much better in this regard, so this limitation of the Forerunner 45 seems arbitrary to me.- Good points: -Light weight and good size. Feels great running and I barely notice that it's on my wrist when I run. I don't understand why the bezel is so large though - presumably making the actual screen bigger would decrease the battery life. The screen is big enough I feel - I never felt that it was too small while running.Battery life is less than some other watches but easily long enough for the longest runs that I expect to be undertaking anyone soon. I don't expect that I'll be running 10 hours non stop in a single day anytime soon. Standby battery life lasts for 4 or 5 days with some running thrown in - I think that's fine really.Always-on amoled display. This is pretty great and I like this a lot. Not having to flick your wrist up every time to see the time is a great feature.The Garmin connect app is good - looks nice and is easy to read.The Garmin training plans are a highlight for me - the half marathon plan has been solid and the integration within the Garmin Connect app and the watch is solid.- So why only 4 stars? -Because it's a GPS running watch foremost and a smart watch as an afterthought. It has smart watch features but they're just 'ok'. It is however very good as a running watch and this makes up for its flaws as a smartwatch - for me.I also think that even €150 (The price I purchased at) is not very competitive - for €50 more you can often buy an Apple Watch 3, which is an excellent smartwatch and a good running watch as well. For many people, the Apple watch may be a better option.- Overall verdict? -I think it's too expensive for the features provided but it is a very good running watch and the Garmin Connect application is great. The integrated training plan is awesome and it's the reason that I don't give this watch 3 stars - it really is that good.I don't regret the purchase at all but I'm not sure I can recommend it to someone who wants a great running watch, which can also work well as a smart watch.Edit: The backlight timeout can in fact be adjusted - or made to stay on until you press the button again. From the home screen hold down the 'up' button', which will open a menu, scroll down to 'system', then scroll down to 'backlight'."", 'Ottimo prodotto, Garmin è una garanzia, preso per un regalo che sembra essere stato molto apprezato.']"

Smartwatches can be useful and fun but can also be flakey, complicated, amazingly bad at simple things, and visually hideous. Garmin has a pretty nice product in the vívomove HR that rarely leaves my arm with some real strengths but also some all too common (among smartwatches) flaws. I think it's the best product on the market but I am still constantly annoyed in small ways and bewildered why simple things are not done properly. Before I list a bunch of negatives, please keep in mind many of these negatives are industry wide issues. Garmin may not be pushing innovative approaches in this watch but it's comparatively pretty great. As such, I'd only compare this to similarly detailed reviews of other smartwatches or best for someone looking at this vs living without a smartwatch.Pros:-Battery life is awesome. A week in actual use if not more. It's plenty. It's at least twice as much as plenty.-The hands show the time, all the time. They also move out of the way (minute hand goes to 10minutes and the hour hand goes to 10 hours) which is cool to look at when you utilize the screen.-The touchscreen is completely invisible when you're not showing something. It really looks like a normal watch. It's tasteful. Not too nerdy. People won't think you're wearing a fitbit or a calculator watch.-It has weather data. I can't live without quickly accessing the weather for today and tomorrow on my watch. This is why I have a smartwatch and in and of itself rules out most of them.-The screen is sufficient for text messages and showing you the name or number of who is calling. It can also tell your phone to pick up which is a great thing for iphone users who can't properly answer their own phone by sliding the answer button across the screen due to OS lag.-The heartrate meter and the pedometer work fine. I'm not totally into fitness stuff but they don't get confused by my leg shake while sitting or similar. The meter does not dig into your wrist at all. It’s like a normal watch level of comfort.The meh:-The screen could be bigger. The second and minute hands move out of the way so the entire lower half of the watch could be a screen. Would give a few more characters of room for text messages which would help a little.-The hands move to 10 and 2 regardless of if they interfere with the screen or not. If it's 10:01, they'll move to show 10:10 when you interact with it. There's no need to move the hands in that situation. This might be intentional, the moving hands is kinda a party piece.-The interface consists of touch left, touch center, touch right, swipe left, swipe right, and hold. It's still remarkably repetitive within that design to get through the menus. Something like touch, hold, swipe left, swipe left, touch center, touch center, swipe left 4 more times, touch center is probably a typical interaction for like, asking it to resync. It's not super bad but it's not properly optimized.-The watch is a little thick and is a little big (44mm). Neither is particularly noticible but put a normal 42mm watch next to it and it will look decent sized. Considering the battery life I think the thickness is pretty impressive really and 44mm is hardly “large” in today’s oversized world but it’s important to point out. I got confused by the different watch choices Garmin offers in this product but as far as I know, they’re all 44mm around with 20mm bands and roughly the same thickness.-The screen isn’t bright enough in direct sunlight. The hands however are great in direct sunlight. Few smartwatches have hands. You will know what time it is while somebody with an apple watch tries to shield their screen.-The fitness monitor concept seems pretty pervasive in our society but it’s really pretty half baked. You want to know if walking more and using the stairs more is going to burn a couple more calories a day? Yeah, it works. I guess that’s nice. It’s far from a life-altering wellness partner or a substitute for a personally designed exercise program.-No replies to text messages or text replies to declining a phone call. I had a pebble and this sorta worked, it was buggy. In concept it’d be nice to have a few canned messages like “ok” or “I’m in a meeting I’ll get back to you in a couple minutes” that you could pick from. I don’t think many watches do this well so I put it here.The bad:-The face is not lit and the hands/hashes are not glow-in-the-dark. Why? This seems so simple. The “black sport” version I got has a very yellow minute hand and a very yellow 12 and 6 hash markers but both have no glow. The whole point of this watch is the hands, isn’t it? Why make them useless in the dark. You can of course activate the smartwatch (which I set to double click) and it can show the time digitally which will be QUITE BRIGHT when it’s too dark to see the hands.-There is no (or does not function well ) automatic LED backlight adjustment for ambient light conditions. It’s too bright or too dark nearly every time you use it.-The sleep tracker thing is somewhere between nonsense and inaccurate.-The price is nearly twice as much for the metal casing ones with nice bands. The cheap version at least has some yellow paint to help you read the hands (not glow though) and the band has some easy quick-release pins but I am disappointed Garmin wants >$100 more simply for a metal case. The band got replaced by a conventional metal mesh band which I like a lot better. Annoying how poorly packaged the nice watch hardware is.The really bad:It loses sync 1-2 times a day. Every morning when I wake up I have to spend ~60 seconds going through a specific process. 1) Open the phone app (even if you left it on your phone all night) 2) wait for it to sync 3) select pair now under settings+Bluetooth settings. Only then can I get the high and low temperatures for the day streamed to my wrist. Certainly not going to be 5 seconds after I open my eyes in the morning.I like it. I’d recommend it. I just don’t understand why more thought can’t go into the basic operation and layout of these products. Technology wise it all seems pretty great. Clean up the interface. Add glow paint to the hands and a couple hashes. Come up with some way to have it sync without me telling it to on my phone in the morning. Make the screen a little bigger. Stop making me swipe through your menus so much, you have more control points than you’re utilizing.The device works pretty well as a business tool. You get notifications of upcoming meetings that show up on your phone. You can see who’s calling you in a meeting politely. You can even sneak reading a text message in a meeting. The hands and invisible screen make it very stealthy and it’s fairly conservative design means you can wear it with most attire (even a suit if you change the band to something nicer). It seems targeted more at the fitness crowd but it’s strengths lie more with work."", 'Lo recomiendo ampliamente, tienes varias funciones que esperas de un reloj inteligente de buena gama; te permite visualizar las llamadas entrantes, contestarlas o rechazarlas, aunque no tiene speaker. Los mensajes de correo, o aplicaciones como whatsapp o facebook puedes revisarlos desde tu reloj. la aplicación para tener un seguimiento de tus rangos normales o pasos es muy intuitiva y tiene funciones como horas de sueño, ejercicio, ciclo menstrual, FC entre otros.

Viene con cable de entrada usb, y se carga por completo en una hora. es muy bonito y resistente en el agua.', 'I was afraid it would be too big, but it is not. The black face is really classic. It is a perfect watch. I am an old school watch wearer, but I really wanted a heart rate monitor and step counter. This is the perfect combination of both.', 'There are quite a lot of people that choose their fashion carefully and want their watches not to look like a computer screen.  This watch stands out as having a lot of the function without any of the often trades left to deal with when you want a smartwatch.So much of the features are hidden in the Garmin Connect app, that this is both a blessing and a mild curse.  My wife wanted all the features but without any of the dead giveaway of a fitness tracker.  To be subtle and mission accomplished.  If not one gripe.  I am not sure how many have had to deal with the watch hands being inaccurate, but I suspect plenty being that Garmin puts a function in the watch to realign the watch hands back to accurate.  Something initially my wife thought was just a broken watch, she noticed the watch hands started to be ""fast"" or ""slow"" at times over the coming days.  She wanted to return the watch as faulty, before I had a look.No, the watch isnt faulty, or at least you can workaround the issue.  My suspicions are this happens when the battery level is getting low, but the watch hands will not coincide with the digital time readout if you compare them.Luckily, though this is gone over at setup time (which of course my wife ignored), this is something you can adjust before shipping the unit back.  Simply hold down on the screen for roughly 2 seconds where the digital display normally is and it will show the menu screen.  Swipe right a few times till you see the clock with 2 arrows indicating clockwise and counterclockwise simultaneously.  This is the hand calibration screen.  First rotate each hand to indicate exactly noon (or midnight whichever way you look at it), and once adjusted, exit the menu and the hands will once again align with the actual time.  Took me all of a few seconds to figure this out without the tutorial or setup guide/manual, but I do this for a living.  I simply thought to myself, well if I design a unit without buttons, but a touchscreen in place, how would I do it.  Yup, bingo, it can be adjusted.  Hopefully this helps someone.Overall, the watch is right in the segment where there are some to choose from, but not many.  The Garmin Connect app is actually quite well done, so this fills in from a lot of shortcomings other watches in this segment tend to have.  I would buy it again, but let it be known the watch hands sometimes trail against the real time.', 'I’ve had the watch for almost a year. Ivr had fossil and withings hybrid watches as well. Battery life started with about 10 days, then a week, then 5 days. Now, it’s about 3 days.The digital display is not as clear as the Withings Hybrid,  (which sucks for those of us who need reading glasses) but it’s a cooler looking watch.My favorite part: when I get a spam call on my cell phone (in my pocket), I can decline it on the watch. Also, I’ve used the “find phone” several times to find my phone in my house.The audio allows to play/pause/forward/back but no volume control unlike the fossil watches.I like that it’s waterproof and I can swim and shower with it - unlike the withings watch.Overall, it’s a good watch, but not perfect. Not yet.', 'The watch works and looks as described by the seller.', ""Got.it for my husband's birthday. He loves it Good quality, gives a ton of readings and the greenish color looks really great."", ""The watch is very good for what I want to use it for. I love how it looks (like it isn't a fitness tracker) and the price is decent for this type of watch! It's not too thick or heavy and I love the color (silver/blue).The good: the menu on the watch is extensive and it took me a few days to go through it and get used to how it works. Once I learned my way around, it's good. Remember to start activity tracking on the watch before you finish! LOL. Others: Battery life. Charging. Fast synching to phone. Message and email alert and can read most of them right away on the watch.The fine: App. I would love a way to delete some of the options but haven't found it yet. It's a bit confusing to find the main screen after leaving it and is there a way to stop it from tracking flights of stairs? This isn't something I do right now and it's just too much. APP is sometimes too much. It does sync with phone/watch no problem and updates quickly.The bad: As other reviewers have said the strap it comes with does start to irritate after 1-2 weeks of consistently wearing it. I had to remove it at night or leave it off for a day. I didn't wear it in the shower.The wifi connection alert :( . I had to disable watch wifi when my phone was IN THE NEXT ROOM. This is the most annoying feature EVER. Imagine waking up by a buzz saying that the watch wifi connection is broken and then 2 minutes later another buzz saying the watch is now connected. This goes on and on and on. I started to turn on 'don't disturb' on the watch and set a sleep schedule (sleep and wake) on the app. These seem to help.Overall, I would recommend this watch to someone who wants to track fitness (time, HR, calories, distance), a good price, a known brandname, and a stylish looking watch."", 'I\'ve had this watch almost two weeks now, and I really like it. I love that it looks like a normal, classy watch. It has all of what I want (tracking steps, heart rate, stress, sleep, giving me phone notifications so I don\'t have to check my actual phone as much), but it presents all of this in a very streamlined, elegant manner so I don\'t feel like it\'s bogged down with bells and whistles. It\'s also very easy to customize what the watch will show and what it doesn\'t, what notifications it gives, so it\'s easy to make it even more streamlined (for example, I removed the music control widget as I\'m probably not going to use that one).Protip: The ""messages"" widget needs to be visible in order to receive notifications from your phone. This seems obvious in retrospect, but I played around with hiding that widget and it prevented any notifications from coming through.Probably the only con is that sleep tracking isn\'t super accurate, as some people have said. The problem is mainly recording when I fall asleep and when I wake up. For example, if I lay down to watch a movie before bed, it\'ll think I went to sleep, or if you wake up but lie in bed for a bit and don\'t get up right away, it will think you are still asleep. But in the app you can always manually edit what time you went to bed and what time you woke up to get more accurate data. I think the tracking in between falling asleep and waking up is good.In a possibly counter intuitive way, it has made me less tied to my phone because I\'m not preemptively checking for notifications, I trust my watch to let me know if someone is trying to get a hold of me! I also programmed it so that it doesn\'t send me things like Facebook notifications, to further minimize distraction by my phone. Now I only check my phone when I really need to.Lastly, I was worried it would be too big on my extremely tiny female wrist, but it isn\'t at all, and the ordering the small band worked perfectly.', 'This was a gift for my husband for Christmas. He takes pride in remaining as lo-tech as his family and work will allow, but I just KNEW he\'d appreciate the text notifications, step-tracking, and weather features of this watch. Making it a gift, he felt obligated to at least try it. LOL. Happy to say, he really likes this watch! It doesn\'t LOOK like a smartwatch, which is important for him, and it really is good at the very basic things you might want from a smartwatch. He\'s not a fitness geek, nor does he want to be super-connected all the time; just wants to know when he gets texts from family and colleagues, and since he doesn\'t always have his phone at the ready, the watch is great for this. Response time to my own texts has improved dramatically. ;) His only complaint is that it\'s hard to wake the screen up at night to check the time. He used to have a backlit watch that he wore to bed, and that\'s been an adjustment. He has a clock next to his bed now. Not a huge change, but it\'s annoying (to him especially) that he can\'t easily check the time on his watch in the middle of the night. It\'s strange that they took the features of this watch so far and then were like, ""Screw it, we can\'t possibly add any more (simple) features to this watch."" You could\'ve added that one! Still ... it gets a solid 4 stars. It\'s a good-looking, stealthy smartwatch that has 90% of the basics down pat for your typical user.']"

No communication and utter disregard to addressing customer issues.*Update on Nov 3, 2019* - this one is as inconsistent as I had experienced in the beginning. The tracker has totally stopped syncing and support is utterly useless and not one to trust. They asked a whole lot of questions and when all else failed they just said that my phone is not supported. I had shared this info when opening the ticket. It is a OnePlus 5T. Can't imagine Android not being supported. Reduced a star. Not worth it as it is now an expensive watch!!***I bought two of these last month - one for me and one for my wife.Overall - I am very underwhelmed with this offering of Fitbit. I expected a lot given the brand name, the pedigree and the lineage but surprisingly it is lackluster.Pros: It has all the promises of the what you need from a good fitness tracker. Offers Heart rate tracking, steps, activities (a limited number of activities like run, walk etc are automatically tracked), Sleep Tracking etc. It is supposed to be water resistant up to 50 mtrs. I have not tried it out and hence can't comment. The build is sturdy. Feels comfortable on the wrist. I especially like the fact that there are 2 straps of diff sizes provided. A decent app. Battery has been amazing. It easily lasts over 5 days. Sleep tracking has been very good. The distance seems to be tracked accurately, as well as the floors climbed, but it seems to over-count the steps. I play badminton and it was automatically recognized as a sport and logs it as an activity. That was helpful.Cons: The app is very basic. I still don't understand why it requires location and Bluetooth to be enabled AND a proper data signal to sync between the phone and the device. Makes absolutely no sense in this day and age. The sync is a disaster. In the 3 weeks I have had the device, I have had issues every week where the app does not recognize the device. You have to do a hard reboot (you can only do this when it is connected to a power outlet!!!) to reset this and you lose all the data that is not yet synchronized. So, better carry the charger with you all the time so that you don't lose data. It is as stupid as it sounds. I thought this was specific to Android but my wife, who uses an iPhone, experienced the same issue as well. Bluetooth connectivity seems to be a problem. The SPO2 tracker is not activated yet.So, overall, it promises a lot but I hope they get their act together in ensuring reliability and also providing insights through a better app. They only need to look at Garmin to see how well they do their job. I am counting on Fitbit to make those strides quickly.

Initially I wasn\'t able to decide on what fitness band I should shell out my cash. And after rigorous research about all the companies out there and watching few videos on YouTube, I came to the conclusion of purchasing the ""Charge 3"".To be honest, I have made the right choice. There are many brands out there providing fitness bands at cheap price but I would suggest investing your money in a good one such as a FitBit. It is a little expensive but you won\'t regret it. Other brands would provide you fancy specifications but the main motive of a fitness band is to track your day to day activities, to keep you motivated to go to the gym daily and set and achieve certain goals in regards to fitness which in my opinion, ""Fitbit charge 3"" excells with flying colours!~~PROS~~1) Display: It is well lit. And is easily visible in daylight2)Battery: It can sustain it self for a week with full charge3)Waterproof: I have not used it while swimming. But I usually drench it with water while washing my face lol. And It wotks fine so no issues in it.3) Accuracy: I compared my colleague\'s iwatch and my fitbit while watching heart rate and they both were almost similar. So you can say that fitbit is 90-95% accurate as to iwatch.4)Build: The build quality feels premium. And fits comfortably on your wrist. They even provide extra band incase you lose one.~~CONS~~I HAVE NOT FOUND ANY AS OF NOW. But I\'ll let you know if I come across any.I would definitely recommend you to go with it! You have made the right choice thinking of it!', ""I had the fitbit alta before this in 2016. Slacked on my fitness journey in 2017/18, decided to take charge this year. I bought this tracker in Jan 2019 and waited for a month to review and here are my observations:1. I faced step count issues with this. It refused to track my steps and I had to try many methods mentioned on the fitbit forum all of which were stop-gap arrangements. The good part however -the Fitbit support on Twitter is exceptional. They are quick to respond and relentlessly follow to ensure you are satisfied with your product. They remotely rectified the issue with a few details I shared about my Fitbit account and ever since, this tracker is the best decision I made. I STRONGLY recommend anyone who's facing issues with their fitbit to connect with Fitbit customer care on Twitter.2. I am new to running so it doesn't bother me that I need assisted GPS to help track my runs - if you are not a runner, this shouldn't bother you.3. Love that it is compatible with many of my apps for notifications4. Love how it's able to customise and track multiple forms of exercises5. The not so good: I am starting to sense a rash creeping up, but I also think this could be because my band is too tight or some moisture (water or sweat) was caught in and was unable to dry up in time. I never faced this with the Alta but I was extremely careful about keeping my Alta dry6. Yet to try this for a swim so no inputs there.7. Tip: Use this to record your exercise and water intake, Use My Fitness Pal for your food intake - it has a wide variety of food options across the globe - many Indian brands and items included, Use Record (Under Armour) to track other activities like kayaking for example - Record and MFP sync to your Fitbit and I find the combination of these 3 most efficient to track my fitness journey."", 'I bought my Charge 3 January 31st, 2019. This is important because the Fitbit warranty covers a year from the purchase date, and because at that time, the Charge 3 cost what a Charge 4 does now.I absolutely love my Fitbit’s functions. It has been very helpful to me in getting active and losing weight. I’ve always had issues wearing watches or bracelets on my wrist, but I never had that issue with my Fitbit. I’m not sure if it’s because of the strap or the lightness and shape of the Fitbit, but it hasn’t been an issue to wear it through the night. I even bought an Aria scale because I was enjoying it so much.The app is mediocre and a lot is locked behind a premium service. Fine, I get it. It’s a little silly that you drop so much money on a device and then have to additionally pay a subscription if you want to access all the features, but that’s how things are now. And the basic data is fine. It’s just nothing to write home about. For example, if you want specific data about your heart rate while you sleep or if you want to enroll in any of their “wellness” courses, you need the premium membership.I’ve had issues on and off where the device says it’s at full charge (after I charged it shortly prior), and then a couple hours later drops dead. When I plug it in again, it says it had no battery left. So I’d wait for it to charge again, and it would be back to its normal 5-6 days of life. This happened maybe 3 or 4 times in the year and nearly 4 months I’ve owned the device. Annoying, but not a deal breaker.The band of the Fitbit also broke within a few months of me owning it. And I’m not super rigorous with it’s use. I wear it on my wrist and don’t do anything too crazy. I haven’t even gone for a swim with it, despite its compatibility. That had me a little displeased, but I bought a 3rd party replacement (it was 1/4 of the cost of the one offered by Fitbit and I figured if this was going to be common I didn’t want to toss my money down the drain). Funnily enough, I haven’t had any issues with the band even LOOKING like it was going to break since.Then came the straw that broke the camel’s back. One day, (May 9th), I plugged my Fitbit in to charge like normal. As soon as I did, the screen corrupted like you can see in the picture. Googling the issue told me that this was a fairly common issue, and I tried all the troubleshooting offered with no luck. Not only is it corrupted, the sensitivity of the screen has dropped drastically and I have a hard time getting to the swipe menus. Sometimes, it turns completely unresponsive for a short period of time and I have to hit the button until it does. This is where that year-long warranty comes into play. It had been a year and about 3 months when this issue occurred, and I emailed Fitbit in case they might have a solution. Alas, after waiting over a week for the first reply, they gave me a troubleshooting solution I had told them in my original email that I had tried with no success. I emailed back and told them that. They replied about processing a replacement, asking where I live and where I bought it. I replied, and then they asked me all the way to my detailed address, phone number, and yet another picture of my Fitbit so they could see what color it was to send. I was obviously happy since I knew it was technically past the warranty date, but since they hadn’t seen an issue with my location or where I purchased it, I figured it was ok. I mean, it’s a little disappointing to have an expensive device falling apart after a bit over a year of use. After that reply, there was nothing until today (about 5 days) when I finally get the reply that it isn’t eligible for the warranty. It took nearly two and a half weeks for that conclusion! I understand it being behind the warranty, but I’m left feeling frustrated by the mixed messages and the quality of this expensive product, especially because I did not do anything unusual to break it.Tldr; It has nice functions, but you’re better off going with a different brand that has better quality.', '最初の1台目は保証切れたら壊れた']"

Me gustaba que el reloj fuera grande y por constitución, a mi me queda perfecto. Lo noto cómodo y el aspecto es muy bueno.Tal vez no sea su objetivo principal; los ultra maratonianos. Para mi Ironman sigue siendo una peli. Pero entreno varias veces por semana (bicicleta de montaña y pádel) y puedo decir que, con un registro de 90 minutos, 6 veces a la semana, la batería aguanta estupendamente. El GPS es preciso. Encuentra señal enseguida. Y la información en pantalla es lo suficientemente customizable por mi como para tenerme satisfecho. Eso sí, TODO, con la cinta de pecho.Quiero dejar claro que el registro de pulsaciones del sensor de muñeca es inservible del todo. Ni apretando. Ni moviendo. Ni invocando a San Suunto. Puedo estar empezando una subida con la bici y el reloj tranquilamente marcarme 50 ppm. Y no, no me apellido Indurain.De otras quejas que he leído: no me molesta la baja resolución de pantalla, aunque es cierto que no soy un corredor nocturno. No lo uso como smartwatch así que tengo desconectados los avisos al reloj. Ah: y la app. El Polar estaba MUY enfocado más al fitness que a la interpretación subatómica de los Newtons y Julios gastados en cada paso que se daba, y la monitorización de la actividad basal estaba más lograda y la app era más clara de entender. (Idem con Garmin, que estuve probando una temporada el fenix 5, que devolví por caro y por el monitor de muñeca también). SIN EMBARGO, una vez te acostumbras, la app de Suunto (NO el movescount, que ya no me la he descargado) es completa y suficiente para mi gusto.Una pequeña nota final: yo me lo compré como producto reacondicionado a un muy buen precio. Para mí cumple sus funciones, ME ENCANTA como luce, y con la cinta al pecho registra todo perfecto. Pero también es cierto que si un producto tiene tantos ejemplares de sgeunda mano reacondicionados, es por algo.Lo recomiendo, sí. Pero no es para todos. Espero mi opinión ayude.', ""After using the Suunto 9 for over a month now, I can try to summarize my experience:PROS+ Beautiful screen, higher res and better colors than the ones on Garmin and Polar watches.+ UI is intuitive and easy to navigate.+ Data is displayed beautifully during an activity.+ Wristband is comfortable to wear all day long.+ Buttons are nice and clicky.+ GPS+GALILEO (introduced with latest firmware update) is awesome and when you get a good satellite lock can put you within 10-20 meters of a route's actual distance.+ Best distance calculated from accelerometer I've seen in a sport watch.+ Amazing battery life for activity tracking with different modes.+ Great route-building tool in the Suunto app.+ Native support to Power Meters like the Stryd footpod.+ Sales means I could get it with a 24% off discount.CONS- Doesn't have as many fearures as the Fenix 5 line, its main competitor.- GPS lock can take a while when skies are not that clear or around tall buildings – competitors are faster.- Data screen customisation not as flexible as Garmin.- Doesn't provide as much data as Garmin on the watch or on the Suunto app.- Wrist heart rate measurements not as accurate as Polar.- Sleep tracking is only decent.- 24-hour Heart rate measurement is OK but the app doesn't provide a history or do anything with the information.- Doesn't have sensors competitors have like a Barometer (you'll need to go for the Suunto 9 Baro for that).- Route navigation is just OK.CONCLUSIONBuy it if you get a discount on it (like I did), if you are an ultra-runner or Ironman athlete (not quite there myself), if you intend to train with the Power metric (ordered my Stryd footpod) or if you find the Fenix 5 watches ugly and complicated to use (like I do).If you want to pour over the data of every run in the app or on a website after you finish, this is not for you."", 'Speichert nicht die GPS Route zurück auf Apple Health (GPS Daten fehlen), obwohl alle Berechtigungen gesetzt sind. Auf der Suunto App und Strava ist die GPS Route sehr wohl sichtbar.Nach anfänglichem Funktionieren  des Synchronisieren zu Strava und Endomondo, ging es nicht. Erst nach Löschen der Verbindungen uns neuerlichem Verbinden gehe es derzeit wieder. Fehler tritt wieder auf => neuerliches Löschen und Verbinden. Achtung, möchte man sein Workout auf Strava haben, vorher die Fit-Datei abspeichern und manuell in Strava importieren, da das neuerliche Verbinden mit Strava nur die zukünftigen Workouts betrifft.Die Beleuchtung einschalten beim Modus ""Umschalten"" mit der 2-Finger - Berührung funktioniert selten, muss immer wieder umswitchen auf automatisch, sonst bleibt die Uhr immer dunkel. Ich finde keine Möglichkeit im Training das Display kurz zu beleuchten anstatt immer die Hintergrundbeleuchtung (die am Akku saugt, der allerdings wirklich ein tolle Laufzeit hat) einzuschalten.Das Zoomen der Route während des Trainings ist nicht sehr praktikabel. im Navigationsscreen die mittlere Taste 1s drücken, bis eine Plus und Minussymbol erscheint, dann auf die Taste oben oder unten drücken.Der Support ist telefonisch trotz mehrmaligen Versuchens nicht erreichbar. Nach 5 Minuten wird das Gespräch von Suunto beendet. Einen Support per Email oder Chat kann ich nicht finden. Es gibt nur noch die Möglichkeit über die Suunto App. Auch darauf erfolgt keine Antwort.Ansonsten finde ich die GPS-Genauigkeit gut, auch wenn etwas ungenauer als meine Polar V800 oder Apple Watch 4 oder meine TomTom Spark3, aber auf Augenhöhe mit Garmin.Der Herzfrequenzsensor liefert trotz Positionierung, Aufwärmen meist unrealistische Werte. Ganz schlecht im Vergleich zur (schon nicht so guten) Garmin Forerunner 935, der TomTom Adventurer oder Apple Watch 4.Die Uhr hätte ich behalten, wenn wenigstens der Support erreichbar gewesen wäre.', ""Great watch. Handy for long distances. I am not sure how accurate the heart rate monitor is, but is ok for reference. The back light function is a bit annoying, as you have to press a separate button, which when running can be a bit awkward. It's not the end of the world and is ok once you get used to it. Lots of multi sports modes is a plus.Initially I got sent a book instead of the watch, but Amazon quickly rectified this."", 'El reloj va genial en general. Yo lo uso sobre todo para carrera (asfalto y montaña), pero también registro otras actividades como entrenamientos de fuerza, yoga y natación. Es cierto que con todo activo la batería dura menos, pero aun así aguanta 4 o 5 días. El GPS a veces da problemas de conectividad. Para natación no va bien. El sensor de pulsaciones en la muñeca tampoco es preciso y yo opté por comprar una banda de pecho. Lo peor que tiene son las aplicaciones, puesto que hay 2: Suunto App y Suunto Movescount. Estas aplicaciones no son compatibles entre sí y utilizar una de ellas supone renunciar a la otra. En la web del fabricante se recomienda tener Suunto App en el movil y usar la Movescount en pc para que no den problemas entre sí, si es que se quieren usar en paralelo.', 'Sieht man einmal davon ab, dass der Pulsmesser meistens unsinnige Werte anzeigt, wie das halt so bei Armgelenkmessung üblich ist, dann ist diese Uhr die mit Abstand beste Sportuhr, die ich je hatte. Wasserdicht, extrem präzises und robustes GPS/Glonass, super integriert mit Strava usw., und dann diese Akkulaufzeit. Bis zu einer Woche. Unglaublich. Den einen Stern Abzug gibts, weil die unterschiedlichen Oberflächen grafisch nicht der Brüller sind, weil Updates nur via Kabel über den Rechner aufgespielt werden können und weil der Smartwatch-Funktionsbereich rudimentär ist.', '""+"": good battery life (for 15h training per week), GPS is nice (not working good in cloudy weather, forest, city with high buildings), convenient switching in Multisport mode.""-"":1. HR sensor on wrist is not accurate at all during exercises (measures in water are not reliable at all)2. mistakes in laps counting in swimming pool3. losing distance on track running (probably because of shape of track - oval), weird working after updates4. sometimes switching off during exercise, can take lot of time to find GPS/sensors (even if sensor connected in advance)5. when battery is low  (below 20%) - working very bad6.  GPS is not working in open water swimming (just stops tracking after 400m).7. in sunny conditions, screen is badly visible.8. The green light from HR wrist sensor is too bright so can disturb during time (it switches simultaneously during the night or because of hand position - no idea).9. Sometimes losing connection with sensors during exercises.Sum up:My requirements were good accuracy in GPS (counting distance and speed - pace for running) and accuracy in HR sensor (I used Suunto HR Smart Sensor with watches).My conclusion is to expensive for using as GPS tracker only. Functions announced by Suunto - half is working OK only. HR sensor on wrist is just a joke, including HR Smart Sensor. HR measures just a crap.Will not recommend to buy it.if you are looking for reliable HR measures - consider POLAR or WAHOO TICKR.  For only activities required accurate GPS metrics (and less HR) - it is probably not bad choice, if price below 250 eur.', ""I've owned a Suunto watch in the past but this was the first wrist based heart monitor and I have to say this was poor. I don't know if I had a dud but the heart rate tracking continuously dropped out. I tried switching wrists, tightening the band loosening the band and wearing it on the inside of my wrist just to see if it made a difference bit to no avail. It was a real pity because I like the Suunto app and it's implementation but it was spoiled by the hardware. This item was returned for a full refund."", 'Per gli appassionati del trekking e co. Le scelte finiscono sempre tra garmin, suunto e polar....ma alla fine ho scelto suunto per una questione di designe veramente ben curato sportivo e allo stesso tempo elegante. È uno sportwatch che svolge egregiamente il suo mestiere. Quindi scegliete quello che preferite a prescindere dal fatto che uno abbia una caratteristica in piu o meno... L app era un po’ elementare rispetto alla garmin, ma è in costante aggiornamento con migliorie sostanziali. Comprerò sicuramente ancora suunto', 'Eigentlich so eine tolle Uhr! Super robust, Display gut abzulesen, GPS OK, Bedienung gut usw. Wäre da nicht die fehlerhafte Herzfrequenzmessung am Handgelenk. Und ja, ich bin mir bewusst darüber, dass die Messung gegenüber einem Brustgurt immer fehlerbehaftet ist. Auch weiß ich, dass die Messungen am Handgelenk bei manchen besser und bei anderen schlechter funktionieren.Allerdings ist es leider wirklich so, dass die Uhr sehr sehr häufig absoluten Quatsch anzeigt. Wenn der Arm ruhig liegt passt es ungefähr. Sobald man nur ein bisschen schüttelt geht die Herzfrequenz hoch. Je doller man schüttelt um so mehr gehts nach oben. Beim laufen äußert sich das Problem dann ebenso. Hält man die Arme oben und nahe am Körper, passt es manchmal. Wenn Sie die Arme fallen lassen und normal gehen, steigt die Herzfrequenz gerne in Richtung 200 an. Im Vergleich zur Polar Vantage M, die parallel getestet wurde, funktioniert die Suunto 9 leider sehr viel schlechter wenn man auf Handgelenksmessung wert legt. Wirklich sehr schade. Meine Suunto Ambit 1 funktioniert noch tadellos und ich hätte sehr gerne wieder auf ein robustes Suunto Produkt gesetzt. Wenn man bereit ist weiterhin einen Brustgurt zu benutzen und zu zusätzlich anzuschaffen kann man diese Uhr empfehlen.']"

It's not worth that much more to have a separate line on my watch, especially when my phone is still in my pocket 99% of the time.

I know that mileage varies based on the apps you're using, features you're using, how many notifications/calls you get, etc. But what's the point of paying for all of these features and then having to charge it almost twice a day? If you want body tracking stuff and notifications, you would be better off with a Fitbit. I like that I can customize the look of the watch a lot with bands, cases, and watch faces.

(Yes just one!!)>Can not replace battery - Its basically a throw away device when the internal battery reaches the end of its service.  This to me is complete lunacy.  The entire quartz-horology industry has replace-able batteries.  Even Citizen ECO-drives can have their internal batteries replaced.  Suunto and Garmin have watch designs that can be batt-replaced.  I am taking away 1 star for this... Sorry Amazfit... our E-waste land fills are out of control, Our planet can not afford itPROS:>Battery Life - 4-5 days as a basic bluetooth notifier, pedometer, sleep tracker.  I take it off the charger monday morning and make it to Friday evening with about 10% battery remaining.  I charge it Friday evening, so I have a fresh 100% to kick off the weekend, and repeat the cycle.  Every once in a while may charge it mid-week just for the heck of it, but it doesn\'t really need it.>Accurate & fast GPS - I use it on weekend trail hikes to bread-crumb trace my location.  I use the trail run program, no complaints.  It does exactly what its supposed to do.  Signal acquisition takes about 10 seconds every time.  There is a way to download GPX data to the watch, but I haven\'t really found a need for that since I hike marked trails only.>Great APP support - The amazfit watch app on Android is really good.  I get updates about once every ~6-7 weeks.  The updates download and install without any problems.  The updates have not done anything drastic to the user interface,  device function or reliability.... (KNOCK ON WOOD... I hope they don\'t mess up perfection!! right after me posting this review.)>Great display in outdoor sunlight - The more ambient sunlight it gets the better it looks. Indoor and dim lighting look pretty bad though, but I dont personally find this a problem. I think its because they use a really cold-pale tint LED for back-lighting the screen. They should have used a warm-tint, or high-CRI tint LED.  So most definitely dim lighting conditions can be harder to read. But for me I have not found it to be that bad. On a full moonlit night hike, medium sized camp fire, or the dimmest 5 lumen setting on my headlamp I can still easily read the time. I do need to use the watch illumination for the pedometer, battery indicator, and other really small complications though. But as long as I can reflect the dim ambient light off the watch and toward my face I can read the time display.>USB Cable Windows interface - Call me old fashioned, but a good ol\' copper-wire connection is ALWAYS better than a wireless or cloud based option.  Thats just my preference, and the Stratos delivers that.  I plug in the cable, Windows10 detects it and I can see the watch file folder structure just like a USB thumb drive.  I can drag/drop music, GPX maps, and downloaded watch faces.  EASY... Keeping things simple.>1000s of Watch faces - Via the amazfitwatchfaces www site.  Just download the WFZ files to my desktop, and drag them over to the watch face folder via USB cable.  Lots of really nice choices too.  Analog, digital, sports teams, comic character, animal, movie, fashion-designer, motorsport...etc.  New ones uploaded all the time too.>Push button interface - You get 3 buttons on the stratos.  Great for cold weather gloves!!  The bottom button is user programmable.  I have it set to push and hold for a trail run.>Standard 22mm watch strap - Any 22mm after market strap with standard spring bars will fit.  One piece NATO and Zulu straps will block the heart rate sensor though, so thats kind of a bummer.  I guess you could melt a hole in the strap..??  I\'ve never tried this.NEUTRAL:>Serviceable heart rate monitor - I am more into steady-state cardio, hiking, backpacking and trail running.  It is a wrist wearable optical sensor so It is not as accurate as a chest-strap type particularly for interval training and gym-based cardio which is much MUCH dynamic than steady-state cardio.  I find it good enough for what I need, others will certainly disagree though.>Bluetooth reliability - About a month ago my bluetooth connection with my phone just up and quit.  I tried rebooting the watch, phone and certainly the BT radio on my phone to no avail.  Cleared cache on the phone...etc.  nothing worked.  All the while I still had 100% BT connection with my Fossil WearOS watch.  So I did a factory reset on the watch, set up a new user ID account with my second email address and installed the app fresh on my phone.  Its been fine for about a month.  I am not going to take a star away form the Stratos however.  My experience with bluetooth overall as a technology is hit & miss with my various devices.  One bluetooth failure in 4.5 months I think is OK, and par for the course with BT devices in general.>Charging cradle - I kind of wish it were a magnetic charging cable and not a big snap-in charging base.  Magnetic designs are easier to travel with... IMHO.>Good A-C... missing the B - Altimeter and compass are really accurate.  it uses the barometric pressure sensor to extrapolate altitude.  So barometric weather changes result in altitude changes.  I have been on rain-drizzle hikes, where my altitude will suddenly start dropping 2~300 feet without me moving a single foot on the trail.  I could take away a star for this, but AFIAK all wrist worn ABC watches use barometric pressure to measure altitude.  There is no way to manually calibrate the altimeter on the Stratos, which is kind of a bummer... but not really a deal breaker for me.  I do wish it had a barometer reading, not sure why they chose not to have one.  It would be nice to see sudden changes in pressure and better predict weather changes.[5/17/2019]-I just downloaded the 2.3.10.4 update.  Took about 10 minutes.  Watch briefly disconnected bluetooth, rebooted and re-connected bluetooth.  Just sent myself some test notifications.  All seems OK.[6/28/2019]-I just downloaded the 2.3.10.5 update.  Took about 10 minutes.  Watch disconnected bluetooth, rebooted itself and re connected fine.  Went without a hitch.  AWESOME!!... I wish all ""smart"" consumer electronics products received updates this good from the manufacturers.[7/13/2019]-  2.3.10.4 update is stable and reliable.  No problems to report.[8/2/19]-The latest app update downloaded and installed and I have been using it for about half a month.  It seems to be more geared towards runners.  It does not plot-graph miles per hour speed anymore.  It only does miles per minute pace and step cadence... which are totally useless to me.  I am not a runner, I am a backpacker and trail hiker.  I never pace myself  in terms of min per mile, I always prefer miles / hour.If am 4 miles into a 7 mile trek to my camp/tent site. Its now 4:30 and sun down is at 7:45PM. How many miles/hour pace do I need to hike to get there before sun down? Of course I have a head lamp + batteries, so its not vital... but still you see where I am coming from. I have learned over the years 3MPH is a very slow easy pace, 3.5MPH is brisk but comfortable, and I can book 4+MPH on slight downhill with stable footing. So I have to mentally keep in mind the minutes/mile to MPH conversion when I am reviewing my post hike data.', 'Comprei em 2018 e ainda me serve como novo. Produto excepcional!', 'Produto descartável, dura exatos 3 anos. Foi bom enquanto durou', ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Relógio 100% original, a prova d'água, ótimo para exercícios confie em comprar a vontade esse relógio, a caixa da amazfit é linda perfeita com tudo incluso do que esse relógio original têm e você poderia comprar em lojas físicas, Parabéns pelo o excelente produto👏Pessoal, eu estou muito feliz pelo o excelente produto, tenho certeza que vocês também estarão tendo que comprar esse relógio, pra quem é fã de um relógio para suas atividades físicas, receber mensagens no relógio, medir seu BPM por minuto em uma corrida...

Você têm como saber quem esta ligando pra você, você recebe mensagens, só não têm como responder tá, mas ver quem mandou mensagens a você sim...

If it can, I haven\'t found where this can be done.If you\'re running at a certain pace and you slow down or speed up, the current pace-per-mile lags to update to your present speed. I didn\'t notice at first, but when I did I kept my eye on it.Then, I ran the next day (or two) w/my Suunto Ambit 3 and sped up and slowed down. The pace update was much quicker on the same route in basically the same clear weather. It was noticeable.This is still not a complete deal-breaker as I thoroughly enjoy the watch.However, I have an upcoming Triathlon, so I thought I may not use the Amazfit for that; I want a bit more accuracy.So, this past weekend I took the Amazfit out for a 15mile longrun.The software crashed twice while heading out! I restarted it the 1st time and it crashed a 2nd time, so I ""guessed"" where my 7.5mile turnaround would be then zeroed it out. I crossed my fingers hoping it wouldn\'t crash a 3rd time and it didn\'t. So, I guessed pretty well at my turnaround and came pretty close to 15 miles, round-trip.I\'m not going to use it for my Triathlon.I can\'t have it crashing like that.What was especially disappointing is that those crashed segments of my run were not saved in any way. They just disappeared as if I never ran those crashed-miles. So, for you data-hounds I suppose you could manually enter those ""lost"" miles into Strava since you can link the Amazfit to that along w/the proprietary watch software.btw: I don\'t always use the onboard music capability of the watch. This time I did. I wonder if these crashes had anything to do w/that?? Could it be possible that the watch just can\'t multitask all that simultaneous data?? i.e.: GPS + bluetooth?? I don\'t know? But, I took it for a bike-ride and a shorter run after that w/NO music and.....NO software crash ?!?sidenote: The fonts are small, so you can\'t see them at a glance underwater for sure. There\'s only minimum customization of the screens via the phone app. You can trick the fonts to be larger by changing to the minimum # of visible display parameter/per screen in the phone app per/each sport. It\'s decent font-size but I have old-man-eyes and it doesn\'t compare to how large I can get my Suunto fonts.I\'m really sad, but not completely surprised that it crashed. For the price and features, I knew it was too good to be true. However, I wish it was some other facet of this watch that was glitchy.I use it heavily for training purposes, and if I can\'t rely on it for that...then what??UPDATE: 8-21-2018Of course, I missed the return window.I wanted to give it another chance.I went for a bike-ride and it was fine.I still think the calorie count is wrong, though.I took for a run.I will say I\'ve always been impressed at how quickly it finds a GPS signal.So, about a quarter mile into the run I look down and don\'t see the time elapsing.Sure enough, it\'s locked out and the screen is frozen.I try all button combinations to unlock it, but I just give up. I activate Strava on my cellphone and i\'m good to go.I remove the watch and for the duration of my trip home the heart rate sensor is flashing for the whole ride.The watch is physically warm to the touch by the time I get home.Per the instructions, I hold down the power button for 6 seconds to reboot it.The watch is normal again, but previous full-battery is now down to 4% charge.I haven\'t used it since.I\'m wearing my Suunto Ambit 3 again.Nice try Amazfit.You make a great paperweight.', 'Ok, mas a bateria poderia durar mais, mas ok. Dura uma semana.', 'O produto até agora (1 mês) não deu problema. É um relógio muito bom pelo valor, então pelo custo benefício vale a pena.A bateria não dura muito, se vc faz atividades todos os dias e usa o relógio, dura uns 3 dias no máximo, se ficar sem mexer nele dura mais tempo.Pra mim foi ótimo por conta da corrida, marca o pace, o GPS funciona, demora um pouquinho pra encontrar, mas tem que ser em local aberto, se for coberto não funciona direito.Como eu não quis investir muito em relógios mais caros, esse está cumprindo com as minhas necessidades.', 'Bateria dura pouco. Por ser um relógio relativamente caro, achei que teria bastante recursos mas não tem. Único diferencial é que da pra por musicas nele.Em comparação com o Mi Band 4 que eu tive, as únicas vantagens do Stratos é ver as notificações do celular, guardar musicas dentro do próprio relógio, e o brilho em ambiente aberto. Em contrapartida, a bateria do Mi Band dura 30 dias e a desse relógio dura uns 4 a 7 dias atualmente comigo, e as pulseiras da Mi Band são baratas enquanto as do Stratos são caras.Não é que o relógio é ruim, ele é bom. Mas pelo preço, se espera algo muito melhor do que o entregue se compararmos com o Mi Band que é 1/3 do valor.Eu uso o Stratos o tempo todo, só tiro pra tomar banho e carregar. Mas se eu ainda tivesse meu Mi Band, eu revezaria os 2.Por esse preço, esse relógio definitivamente não compensa.', 'Bateria dura bastante, mesmo se vc usa-lo para exercícios diariamente a bateria dura uns 4 ou 5 dias.Se usar pouco para exercícios, dura facilmente 1 semana.Tem diversos tipos de exercícios e esportes disponíveis, o que faz a avaliação da sua atividade ser bastante fidedigna e acurada. O controle de batimentos cardíacos é super legal e bom. Controle de sono e de tempo sentados muito bom também. E cada vez que vc termina algum exercício é feito um resumo detalhado, interessante e bonito de ver.O pareamento com celular é fácil (e para quem tiver dificuldades, no youtube tem vídeos ensinando). Se vc é maníaco por saber tudo e não aguenta ficar longe do celular, vc pode ter acesso a todas (!) notificações do seu celular no seu pulso. Além de ter diversos layouts diferentes para o relógio.Não esquecer que tem memória interna e você pode carregar músicas direto pelo relógio, então se quiser sair para exercícios, pode ir somente com fone e relógio, deixando celular em casa.Enfim, uma excelente compra por um preço muito abaixo em comparação com Samsung e Apple.']"

Precioso! Para mi gusto el smartwatch más bonito que hay por encima del iwatch. Yo me compré también el iwatch para apreciar diferencias. La app que tiene para analizar el sueño es genial, mucho mejor iwatch, básicamente porque iwatch no tiene app propia, y las que hay tienen mucho que aprender de la de firbit. Por lo demás es más versátil el iwatch porque te permite contestar a los WhatsApp y realizar llamadas mediante siri y también recibirlas. Con el fitbit versa recibes los WhatsApp, pero no puedes contestar. Por lo demás genial, te motiva mucho, cuando llegas a 10000 pasos te hace una fiesta!!!', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Je l\'ai acheté pour l\'offrir à mon épouse, pensant que elle était équivalente à mon Apple Watch (ou presque)avec la quel en plus de me donner évidement l\'heure, dates, les infos pour le sport, rythme cardiaque, calories, alarme, rappel, etc... et toutes sortes d\'infos rapides (ou pas) que je souhaites voir sans devoir prendre mon téléphone quand je suis occupée en même temps (ou pas), je peu recevoir des notifications, et répondre aux mails et messages...De ce que j\'avais lu sur la Fitbit Versa sur le site même de Fitbit et quelques vidéos de lancement que j\'avais regarder, elle avait tout ça aussi.. (ou presque). L\'appairage est assez simple, il suffit de suivre au fur et à mesure les instructions, ça met 30 min à l\'allumage,ensuite, selon les choix qu\'on fait, Il faut évidement synchroniser la fitbit via l\'app du même nom, puis il faut la configurer via l\'application, ou directement dessus, à son goût et selon ses besoins.La montre reçoit les notifications, ce qui j\'avoue est déjà chouette, sauf que quand on à un iPhone, on ne sait pas répondre ne fusse qu\'avec les réponses rapides (de bases et configuré au préalable sur son smartphone) directement de la montre alors que si on à un téléphone sous androïde on peut le faire.Si on a un macbook, on sait pas non plus synchroniser la musiques perso sur la montre, même en installant l\'application Fitbit pour Mac, il n\'y à pas de Versa dans le choix des montres de l\'application... alors qu\'apparement sur pc oui, c\'est donc impossible pour nous de la synchroniser pour y ajouter sa musique via nos Macbook. Donc obligé de prendre son téléphone ou mp4 pour allez courir alors que ça faisait partie des options que je trouvais chouette sur la montre.Pour l\'autonomie, 4 jours oui, si vous n\'êtes pas trop dessus. Mais si vous faite beaucoup d\'exercices en l\'utilisant les apps sur la montre, si vous recevez beaucoup de notifications etc... elle ne tient pas les 4 jours, mais plutôt 2 ou 3 ce qui est déjà pas mal et ne pose pas trop de problèmes si vous ne dormez pas avec votre montre elle peut recharger la nuit sur la table de nuit (ou ailleurs) et est recharger en  même pas 2hC\'est un nouveau modèle chez Fitbit, J\'ose espéré qu\'il y aura prochainement une mise à jour qui règle les manques, c\'est pourquoi je n\'enlève qu\'une étoile, j\'espère vraiment que dans quelque temps, ça sera résolu.Sinon, elle est vraiment super, comparé a d\'autres montre connectés plus ""basic"" avec des écrans sans couleurs et sans autant d\'options, elle est très jolie et agréable a porter, légère, malgré le grand cadran, Les finitions sont bien faites.Je la trouve aussi belle que mon Apple Watch l\'écran est un chouilla plus large.En bref, si vous avez un smartphone sous androïde et un pc, vous devriez être ravie... Elle fonctionnera normalement avec toutes les options faites.Dans notre cas, il manque des promesses. dommage...', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Hi I bought this items to you 2018 after 1 year or 2 years you replace for me because my watch is broken still now is broken please if any chance you can help me to replace again please help me and can’t find exactly the date you replace for me please help me I appreciate thank you write to me ASAP', ""I can't believe you sent it without the band on in the first place. I took it to a jeweler, and he couldn't even get the band on because he said the pin was too long. I think you sent the wrong band. The screen is a bit small. It seemed okay otherwise. I had no trouble connecting it or using the app. I took this back being as I couldn't get the band on, and I ordered a new one. The screen is not as big as what's pictured."", 'Ich bin super zufrieden mit dem Fitbit Versa.Bislang hatte ich nur die Fitbit Charge 2 und sonst keinen anderen Fitnesstracker gehabt, sodass ich zu keinem anderen Hersteller einen Vergleich hab. Das ist auch nicht wichtig, weil ich damals für die Charge 2 schon recherchiert und mich bewusst für Fitbit entschieden hatte.Zum Aussehen:Die Versa sieht dem Apple Watch sehr ähnlich, starkes Design und bietet schöne Farbkombinationen.Das Roségold ist im Gegesatz zur Charge 2 nicht kupfergold farben, sondern eher rosagolden wie das Roségold des iphones.Mir persönlich gefällt diese Farbe viel besser als bei der Version von Charge 2.Das Armband ist wie viele schon berichten, viel weicher als beim Vorgängermodell. Die Armbandfarbe ist nach meinem Empfinden so wie der Hersteller sie nennt peach, also pfirsichfarben. Entgegen einiger Rezensionen ist die Watch nicht NUR rosa!Die Kombination trifft genau meinen Geschmack. <3Im Lieferumfang befinden sich zwei unterschiedlich lange Bänder für die Größe S und L, sodass man bei der Versa keine bestimmte Größe bestellen muss.Bedienung:Das Handling der Versa ist sehr intuitiv. Sie hat drei Knöpfe, eine links für das Hauptmenü und zwei recht für Sportartauswahlmund Alarm.Möglicherweise kann man die auch anders einstellen. Soweit bin ich mit meiner Exploration des Versas noch nicht.Man kann wie bei jeder anderen Smartwatch das Menüfeld per Fingerswipen wechseln. Ein dickes Plus, da man nicht wie bei der Charge 2 mit einem Knopf und auf das Display klopfen zwischen den Menüs wechseln muss.Messaging:Bei der Versa kann man je nach Einstellung neben Sms auch Whatsapp Nachrichten anzeigen lassen, was bei der Charge 2 nicht ging.Positives:Definitiv die Wasserfestigkeit von bis zu 50m. Da ich nur selten schwimmen gehe, muss diese Aktivität nicht getrackt werden.Für mich ist es schön, dass sie das kann und ich nun nicht immer befürchten muss, das mein Tracker nass wird.Auch das Abspielen von Musik per Bluetooth ist ein super Feature.Ich gehe regelmäßig ins Fitnessstudio und muss jetzt nicht mehr mein iphone mitnehmen um Musik zu hören.Für mich als Mac User ist es auch gar kein Problem gewesen, meine Musik mit der Versa zu synchronisieren.Wer den Fitbit Coach bislang auf dem Smartphone oder Tablet benutzt hat, wird sich freuen. Man kann jetzt auch alle Übungen auf der Versa anzeigen lassen und sofort mitmachen ohne ständig den Kopf zum Smartphone oder Tablet zu verdrehen.Negatives:Die Aktualisierung, die viele Kunden als Einrichten bezeichnen, dauerte bei mir mehr als zwei Stunden.Wenn man die Versa in Betrieb nehmen will, will diese erstmal aktualisiert werden und dieser Vorgang ist ein Zeitfresser.Doch wenn man das weiss, kann man in der Zeit einfach anderen Beschäftigungen nachgehen. Sicherlich will man nach dem Auspacken der Uhr direkt anfangen alles einzustellen. Mich hatte es nicht so sehr gestört, da es auch nur eine einmalige Sache ist.Nach dem Aktualisieren kann man die Versa nach belieben kinderleicht einstellen.Was mich eher stört, ist die Dauer für die Synchronisation der Musik. Das Laden von 40 Liedern hat sage und schreibe 16min gedauert.Das ist wirklich verbesserungswürdig.Akkulaufzeit:Ich habe die Versa erst seit einigen Tagen. Daher kann ich nicht genau sagen wie lange der Akku hält. Die Angabe vom Hersteller sollte aber passen. Heute nach drei Tagen Betrieb musste ich sie das erste Mal wieder laden. Allerdings habe ich auch fast zwei Stunden Musik über die Versa gehört. Und der Akku war noch nicht komplett runter.Das komplette Laden des Akkus hat auch nur etwas mehr als eine Stunde gedauert.Fazit:Die Optik der gefällt mir super gut. Das Armband ist weich und flexibel und auch seitens der Hardware kann ich nicht meckern.Allein die Software ist hier und da noch nicht ganz stimmig. Es gibt momentan noch sehr wenige Apps, was man Fitbit nicht verübeln kann, da diese noch im Aufbau ist.Ich vergebe trotz kleiner Schwächen 5 Sterne, da ich mit der Versa als Fitnesstracker mit einigen coolen Gadgets zufrieden bin.Was an Software noch schwächelt, wird vermutlich mit den nächsten Updates behoben. Es soll im Mai auch eine App rauskommen, mit der Frauen ihren Zyklus tracken kann. ;)Von mir definitiv eine Kaufempfehlung!', ""I love Fitbit's products and have had a Charge HR 2 and a Blaze. I upgraded to the Versa when it was released and Loved the whole design. Many have likened it to the Iwatch however I've never had one so can't comment on that.I did buy an ionic when released and on offer last year however returned it as I've small wrists and I found it very big and clunky. The versa is basically a slimline version of the Ionic (without integrated GPS)I will list the pros and cons but I need to say why I've only given it 4 stars as opposed to 5 first - I had the versa about 4 weeks when i noticed it wasn't holding the charge. I use it for tracking walks, exercise and get notifications to it but found it started needing to be charged almost every night... whilst on holiday last week the watch started dying during the day despite being charged. Even when I'd turned off HR monitor and notifications. The the screen started fading and showig wavy lines. I contacted amazon as online it said it was 5 days out of the months return period) and they kindly advised I could return it, which I did this week for a refund. I believe there was an internal fault in it and do intend to replace it as it was great otherwise when i initially got it.so here's the pro's:Slimline strap and casing which is ideal even for thin wrists - both sized straps come in the packageGenerally a good lasting charge (until mine got faulty)Bright and touch sensitive screen,waterproof with swim settingCan change clock facesWill have a womens health app eventually (advertised as May but app thats for USA, likely to be Autumn in UK)HR monitor appears to be more sensitve / accurateGood range of activities to choose fromcan link in with other fitness apps and diet apps such as Weight Watchershas all the other usual fitbit settingsCons:Has no built in GPS, only the Ionic has thatFitbit Pay - advertised as being on the watch however only supports 2 UK banks atm and they're very random banks,( only USA has alot of banks supported) so don't buy it for that! (i'm not bothered as wouldnt be keen on using it for payments)The womens health app isn't yet available in UK, probably in the Autumn but no concrete date as yet"", ""J'utilise les trackers Fitbit depuis 2011, la montre Versa est mon troisième après un des tout premiers trackers lancés par la marque, puis après avoir le One ces 5 dernières années.Le Versa est vraiment sympa, la montre a un design très esthétique est assez unisexe contrairement à la Surge et à l'Iconic qui sont beaucoup plus masculines et avec un look très sport. Elle est relativement fine et pour le moment, elle va facilement avec mes vêtements de tous les jours, mais je compte m'acheter un bracelet cuir très prochainement pour un look un peu plus élégant et discret avec des tenues plus habillées.Concernant ses fonctions, on peut tout suivre : rythme cardiaque, pas marchés, distance parcourue, activités physiques, calories dépensées, étages montés, sommeil... Et l'appli sur smartphone est très agréable à utiliser pour centraliser toutes les infos déjà visibles sur la montre. Bonne autonomie avec environ 4/5 jours de batterie et le bracelet en silicone fourni de base est très doux sur la peau, ma crainte était qu'il fasse beaucoup transpirer ou qu'il tire sur la peau, mais non, très agréable.J'envisageais une Apple Watch, mais la partie dédiée à la santé est beaucoup moins développée que sur les produits Fitbit et on a accès à moins d'infos, mais il faut dire que ça n'est pas le coeur de métier d'Apple, contrairement à Fitbit. Et ce qui me manquerait le plus sur l'Apple Watch, c'est le côté social et compétitif que l'on trouve sur Fitbit avec le classement de ses performances par rapport à ses amis et les challenges qu'on peut se lancer. Personnellement, ça m'aide beaucoup à me motiver à bouger et à me surpasser pour monter dans le classement.Bref, je porte la montre depuis 2 semaines maintenant, et je ne peux plus m'en passer. Et gros avantage par rapport au One que j'avais avant et qui se clippait sur ma poche de pantalon, difficile de l'oublier quand on se change dans la journée alors qu'on l'a au poignet !"", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Chiariamo subito. Se, come in questo caso, da mesi prometti aggiornamenti migliorativi che non arrivano mai, il risultato è che ottieni recensioni di questo tenore. Punto. Ora, dobbiamo capire se sono io che per qualche motivo ho cominciato a dare i numeri o c’è qualcosa che non va nelle numerose recensioni entusiastiche su YouTube e canali tech vari. Lascio a voi l’ardua sentenza sul mio stato di salute mentale.Partiamo con i Pregi di questo Versa.-Connessione Bluetooth. Abbastanza stabile su Ios, su S9 ho dovuto già reinstallare l’app Fitbit 2 volte, poiché perdeva la connessione e non la riprendeva più. Capirete più avanti il perché della precisazione.-Ergonomia. Bello a vedersi (gusto personale), leggero e poco ingombrante. Una volta indossato ve ne dimenticherete. Ottima resa visiva anche sui polsi delle signore. Possibilità di cambiare il cinturino in modo semplice e veloce, una delle parti più soggette ad usura, non datelo per scontato, in Garmin ad esempio mica ci sono ancora arrivati su tutti i modelli...Tantissimi ricambi di marca e non, se volete anche solo variare il look, nessun problema. Ottimo lavoro!-Sveglia silenziosa. Una delle poche cose che si sono degnati di sistemare. Ora la vibrazione è continua, dovrete bloccarla premendo l’apposito tasto sul display. Ah però!-Memoria Interna. Circa 2,5 Gb. Più o meno 300 canzoni. Non sarà un’enormità ma se vogliamo ascoltare musica con il solo Versa al polso possiamo farlo. Basterà connettere degli auricolari Bt e il gioco è fatto.-Impermeabilità. Certificato Ip68 fino a 50 metri di profondità. Io a 50 metri non lo rischierei, ma per tutto il resto va più che bene.-Batteria. Più o meno 4 giorni con uso medio/intenso. Anche qui direi che ci può stare. Si ricarica tramite basetta proprietaria in circa tre ore.-Ciclo mestruale. Funzione utile alle signore, non mi addentro in particolari ma, la mia compagna la trova affidabile.-Applicazione Fitbit per Smartphone. Completa, visivamente accattivante e ricca di funzioni. Dal reminder per bere acqua, agli avvisi di movimento se siete troppo sedentari, alla possibilità di tracciare il sonno, all’inserimento del cibo per il calcolo delle calorie. Se fai un buon lavoro ti va riconosciuto. In questo caso ci sono riusciti. Qualche bug di poco conto.-Watchfaces. Ovvero la possibilità di cambiare la schermata dell’orologio. Tante opzioni per tutti i gusti. Facile trovarne una di vostro gradimento.-Display. Si vede bene anche sotto il sole. Touch reattivo. Non sarà full hd, retina, amoled, ma chissene, il suo dovere lo fa egregiamente. Tanto basta.-Community Fitbit. La migliore in assoluto, molto attiva, se cercate una risposta la troverete. Non si può chiedere di più.-Assistenza. Telefonica ed on line. Gentili e disponibili. Peccato per certe risposte un po’ assurde. Più avanti capirete a cosa mi riferisco.-Notifiche. Whatsapp, messaggi, chiamate, promemoria, insomma praticamente tutto. Previste anche le risposte brevi pre impostate per i servizi di messaggistica. Spoiler. Sarebbe anche bello...se solo funzionassero con tutti gli smartphone. Non è così.Difetti. E ora mi sfogo...-Bluetooth. Non esiste una notifica che ti avvisa se il Versa si disconnette dal telefono. Quindi non si capisce bene il range in determinati luoghi e non sai se riceverai o meno le notifiche. Una genialata. Ma vi pare normale? Secondo voi, non essendo un sensitivo nè tantomeno uno degli Avengers, come cavolo dovrei fare ad accorgermene? L’assistenza mi dice che posso controllare dalla lista dei dispositivi Bt del cellulare o dall’app sempre sul cellulare. Si bravo! Ma se sono a 4 metri? Se c’è una parete di mezzo? Se ce l’ho in tasca e si disconnette per un motivo qualsiasi? Ma tu guarda che caspita di risposta!-Bluetooth 2. Se su certi smartphone la connessione è buona (Apple in primis) su altri è instabile. Anche qui...informatevi bene prima di un eventuale acquisto. Inutile dire che dovrebbe sempre funzionare, ma come si dice, una volta toccato il fondo, si può sempre scavare!-Notifiche. Stesso discorso del bt. Dipende dal cellulare. E comunque tutti sti problemi di compatibilità ce li hanno solo in Fitbit.-Attivazione display. Funziona a targhe alterne con il movimento del polso. Dai...fate solo indossabili! Le basi!-Watchfaces. Era tra i pregi, ma è anche tra i difetti. Potrete memorizzarne solo una. Qualora voleste cambiarla dovrete andare a scaricare tramite il telefono. Tutte le volte. Me ne potevi lasciare 3 o 4? No, troppo complicato. Ok, andiamo avanti.-Niente Gps. Alcuni produttori, a parità di prezzo fanno meglio, altri stessa solfa va detto. Dovete sapere che se volete tracciare la vostra corsa dovrete portarvi dietro lo smartphone.-Nfc/Fitbit Pay. In teoria potete pagare tramite il sensore nfc. Già, in teoria. Banche supportate in Italia:2! Carrefour banca (ma che davvero???) e boon. di Wirecard. In questo caso mi sento di consigliare un utile accessorio, che trovate in vendita un po’ ovunque, si chiama, se non ricordo male, portafoglio! Ah, non dimenticate di riempirlo con altri gadget detti banconote...-Tempi biblici. Trasferimento tramite Deezer di 80 brani e sottolineo 80, quindi non mille, ci ha messo più di mezz’ora! Cosa che neanche se li porto a piedi uno ad uno in Piazzale Loreto ci metto così tanto. Aggiornamenti? Anche qui mettetevi comodi, portatevi una tazza di caffè, dei biscotti ed una dose infinita di pazienza. A me nel mentre è scaduta la patente...-Compatibilità (mi ripeto, lo so). Controllate sul loro sito, nella apposita sezione, se il vostro telefono è tra quelli supportati, nel caso non lo fosse evitate l’acquisto o andrete incontro a mille problemi. Ad esempio grosse criticità ci sono con Huawei, tanto per citarne uno a caso. Faccio sommessamente notare che non è esattamente un brand venduto solo in una sperduta zona del Kazakistan! Tutt’appost? No, per niente! Ho visto smartband da 20 euro connettersi con i sassi, ma com’è che tutti sti problemi li avete solo voi?-Assenza di Spotify. Semplicemente il più diffuso servizio di streaming non è disponibile. C’è Deezer. Ok, ma non è che posso abbonarmi a mille servizi solo per far piacere al device di turno. Vero che si possono inserire mp3 tramite pc, però è meno comodo.-Applicazioni. Come posso spiegarlo. Ecco...nello store Fitbit sembra sempre essere il 2 novembre. Una tristezza! Le app sono poche, e meno se ne salvano per realizzazione tecnica. Bene Philips Hue per le lampadine smart, Deezer, Strava, Uber, Flipboard, il NYT, Yelp e poche altre. Come avrete notato molte sono ad ampia diffusione negli Usa ma in Italia lasciano il tempo che trovano. Anche in questo caso si deve fare meglio. Per usare un eufemismo.-Conteggio passi. Se volete un dispositivo che ve li conta anche alla guida o mentre digitate al pc l’avete trovato! Ma quanto cavolo ci volete mettere a calibrare sto sensore in modo decente? Oppure non si può e sarebbe il caso di dirlo? Stesso problema del Charge 3. Va bene per l’autostima, un po’ meno per la realtà. E adesso ve ne racconto un’altra. Per evitare lunghe “camminate al volante” potete scaricare un’app che si chiama Drivebit su AppleStore o Playstore, che si interfaccia con il Versa, in modo tale che capisca che siamo in macchina.

However, I didn't know it was available in silver aluminum to match the cool silver bangle band I purchased separately until I had the black Versa.  So back it went to Amazon only to have to wait the the silver Versa to be back in stock because they were back ordered until the 11th, then the 13th, the 15th, oh you get the idea.  I can only assume they were back ordered so they could fix those bugs a lot of the early reviews on here talk about.  Well, I've had mine almost a full day so I've had a chance to check a few things out.1. Accuracy.  Initial reports show this fitbit being wildly inaccurate in regards of heart rate, steps, flights of stairs, sleep, etc.I looked at heart rate first and while I've always thought my resting heart rate was around 60 this device is showing a resting heartrate of 98.  Well I'm sick right now and hopped up on tons of Sudafed and cough meds so rather than assume its wrong I manually took my heartrate radially and it was actually closer to 105.  So the heart rate feature is pretty accurate.Next, I looked at steps.  A lot of people complained that it counted steps as they drove, moved their hands a lot, or even when they were typing.  I did all of those things and really didn't experience any more than the standard margin of error you normally see with pedometers in general. The 20-50 extra steps that were logged that weren't really steps are negligible to me when I'm logging thousands of steps per day.Flights of stairs.  Versa reports that it counts an elevation of about 10 feet as a set of stairs. So if you're going up or down stairs that are way more or way less than 10 feet then it won't seem accurate.  However, I only went up one flight of stairs when I came up to bed and my arms were packed full.  It still managed to be able to tell that I went up just 1 flight of stairs. And despite all the moving I did all day those were the only stairs I climbed and the only stairs it logged.  So that appears to be working okay.As for driving in a car, I drove all over the place to day and my step counter didn't really change except for when I swung my arms too much dancing in my seat to Justin Timberlake.Lastly sleep.  I'm afraid I can't help you there unless I fall asleep at work.  I can't stand having anythjng on my wrists or hands while I sleep,  not even my wedding ring, so I can't really track my sleep. Sorry.2. Those things addressed, its time to talk about form and functionality.Form: 0HATE the bands it comes with and not because of the pins.  The bands are too bulky and masculine for women to wear everyday.  I put mine on and I didn't feel feminine at all.  But like I said, I got the silver Versa so it would match this awesome bangle band I purchased separately.  I've had several people compliment me just today who are shocked that its a Fitbit.  I am concerned about the face scratching or cracking so I may purchase one of those gorilla guards for it.3. Functionality:  the setup wasn't as smooth as it was when I had that first black one I sent back.  The required 3 part update kept failing and I had to switch from wifi to bluetooth.  It failed a few more times on bluetooth but fortunately picked right up where it left off every time,  even when i restarted my phone to see if that would help. (It didn't.)  Finally after about an hour it was good ti go.  However, the fitbit app was very slow and had a hard time pushing the clock faces and apps I chose to the watch.  I kept getting error messages.  I also wasn't too happy with the selection of apps.  The driving one looked cool but the fine print said it was a free trial of a paid app.  I would have liked too see more exercise or yoga apps or even just more games. Gotta love games.4. Lastly, the buttons and swiping around through screens has been a little hard to get used to.  They're a tiny bit confusing but they don't seem too hard to eventually memorize the layout.  Overall, I like it.  I'll edit my review if things change."", 'I bought this to replace my old Versa that died. I never HAD any problems with that one.... my new one? Yes. Hard to charge, the band fell off,  dont like the clock face. None of these are the sellers fault.', ""Updating my review to state that I'm really liking the watch overall, definitely the best fitbit I've had yet.  Still want improvements to the music syncing, but the other aspects of the tracker are all top notch..................................................................................It's day one and I may update this review as I spend more time with it, but I have to say my initial thoughts are not that positive.  It's certainly a nice looking tracker and the best looking Fitbit that I've had yet, but I'm already questioning the accuracy of the heart rate monitor and counts.  I'm also very disappointed in the horrible methodology by which you get music onto the watch.  They presume that what ever system your music is stored on has both bluetooth and wireless simultaneously.  I keep my music library on a desktop and has bluetooth for my keyboard and mouse, but I had done away with using the desktop for Fitbit syncing a long time ago since smart phones are more than capable of doing the job.  Luckily I still had the little Fitbit dongle and could get the watch to communicate with the desktop app.  And also luckily, I have a wireless card in the desktop as well.But then the Desktop app is somehow picking up on playlists and such from five or more years ago - the last time I used Itunes to manage my media library.  It's not seeing any current playlists.  I have a 10,000+ library of music, and it takes FOREVER to load everything for me to choose what songs I actually want to load.  I guess I have too much music, but the app eventually crashes before syncing anything.  They really need to allow the device to be seen as storage via the USB charging dock so that a user can simply drop whatever music they want onto the device.I'm hoping third party developers come up with better options because music directly on the watch was a big selling point for me."", ""To startoff, I really like Fitbit. I tried using a wearos watch but it didn't have sleep tracking and google fit is kind of meh as an app.As far as sleep tracking (primary purpose really) goes I think it works great, I like the breakdown and summary and benchmarks. it works for short 1-2 hour naps and it works for longer snooze fests. No issues here.The App itself i alright. There are a bunch of features that I don't use; I primarily use it for sleep tracking, steps, and I use it to log and remind myself to drink enough water.The issue I have with the tracking is HR monitoring, I am a very pale skinned person, and sometimes holding my breath while sitting on the toliet will cause my fitbit to think I am fat burning zone. And while I would be ecstatic to learn that I can burn fat doing that, common sense dictates it's probably not true.Another issue was wifi connection, I was unable to connect to my work's wifi but was able to intermittently connect to my apartment's wifi. Not sure why that is, but makes it slightly annoying and slow to download updates over BT.Aside from that the only issue I had was after using it for a week there was a small bug where clearing certain notifications wouldn't remove it. I fixed it by restarting the device, but it's still the kind of minor annoyance you wouldn't expect from a 170-200 USD product.After a month of use the battery life has been great, I keep the display off and intermittently check it once or twice every hour. Battery lasts about 4 days before going down to 25% (which apparently is low battery). It charges fairly quickly too, I got from 20% to full in around 80 minutes or so which is fine. I'll charge it when I am at my computer gaming before strapping it back on until the next charge day.And so it hurts me to say that, such a great product that is marred by a few small issues, I can not rate the versa higher than 3 stars given that both of these issues are core and central to the product's selling point. Come out with a solid fix for the HR monitoring and the other bugs and I can move it up to 4 stars."", ""I've had a Fitbit One for probably about 4 years.  It was originally picked up when I had been a year into working an office sales job when prior to that I was outside on my feet doing landscaping or selling in a garden center.  I wanted something to encourage me to get up and move, and at the time just seeing the pedometer and using the app worked out fine for me.Recently, I've made a much more successful effort to better my health, and during that process, I decided something that could monitor my heart rate would benefit me.  I had been looking at the Charge line, but this one popped up along the way.  I decided to go ahead and go for it.  I'd say for me, the extra cost over the Charge 2 that I had been looking at was worth it.I love having a watch always there, instead of trying to remember if my Fitbit One was in my pocket or not.  It's customizable and allows you to add or remove workouts you don't want to have on the quick start portion.  It tracks my sleep in a way I find fascinating and insightful, as now it means I'm using it to better my sleep habits.  It has a silly little game you can add to the apps part that allows me to make walking a fun challenge.  It also will tell me once every hour if I've not walked around enough, key for me in my office setting.  The text portion is handy for when I'm not looking at my phone, and I love having my daily stats right there if it's not updated to the website dashboard.The biggest thing I still love about it is the heart rate monitor.  It helps me see where I'm pushing myself a bit too hard, and has given me a way to know when I should be increasing my intensity during workouts.  I want to be more fit heart and lung wise, as well as loose weight.  In the two weeks I've had it, I've already improved my resting heart rate, which has encouraged me to continue on!Overall, I love it and hope it continues working for years to come, lasting me as long as my little Fitbit One."", ""I'll start out by reiterating, Fitbit has excellent customer service and I will most likely buy smart watches and fitness trackers from them in the future, but I currently cannot recommend the Versa. I wore a single Fitbit Surge nearly four years and in less than two months I'm already on my third Versa.  The first one lasted about two weeks. It never held a charge the way it was supposed to and it erroneously would say I climbed 50-100 flights of stairs per day.  These idiosyncrasies I could live with but after a couple weeks the bottom half of the touch screen went out completely and the top half was only about half brightness. The touch interface still worked but it was not terribly useful when I couldn't see what I was touching on the bottom half of the screen.  I called Fitbit customer service and after about 20 minutes they agreed to send me a free replacement.  The replacement arrived promptly within a week and after setting up it became clear that while the screen worked for now on this one, the touch interface was not calibrated correctly.  The watch would randomly cycle through screens and select apps or options within apps that had not been touched or even when nothing was being touched.  All this well not acknowledging actual touches on apps and options within apps.  I reset the watch a couple times and tried to give it a day or two to calm down with no luck.  Again fitbit's customer service was excellent. Realizing I already had problems and I had now been given a second dud I was on the phone less than 5 minutes before I was being sent a second free replacement. This time with Rush delivery it took only a couple days to arrive.  Now on my third Fitbit versa with several weeks of wear it has outlasted both of the previous watches and all of its features and functions are currently meeting my expectations.  Should this watch function this well for a year or more I will probably increase my review to 4 stars, but with the above stated issues of quality control that I have experienced I'm not sure I'll ever be able to give this watch 5 stars."", ""Update 1/27/19It won't hold a charge longer than a day now. I have restarted it and it still happens. I guess it's life has come to an end. It's been a little less than a year and I got a lot of use and loved it but sure wish it lasted longer.Update- 11/12/18I was hasty in my negative update. I had the thought it might just be the clock face I had on my fitbit right then and it was. I changed it to the regular fitbit face..it worked.  Then I changed it back to the one I want....and it worked! Back to 5 stars.Update- 11/11/18This has been the best health tracker I've used. BUT Just today my screen stopped showing my steps,  calories, and heart rate. It still shows the time. So strange to me. I'm hoping it can do a update/refresh or something and fix its self.  I lowered it to 2 stars (instead of 1) because itis still at least syncing with my phone so I'm able to keep track through that for now.--------------------------------I just got it a few days ago and it is everything I wanted. I love the size and quality of the screen. I had the alta HR before and decided to go for a change. So fun! I love that I can get it fully wet with no worry. I'm enjoying having a timer on my wrist and setting alarms from my watch instead of my phone now. The fitbit coaching is cool! I love seeing all the stats from the phone app on my wrist. The leaderboard is neat. I haven't put music on it yet. Anyway, awesome smartwatch!"", ""I jumped into the pool when the day's temperature was probably hovering about 63 degrees Fahrenheit in NJ. The device got fried, the screen display was completely black and unresponsive, including the sensors at the back (usually has a green light).  I got home and charged the fitibit versa and it looks like it showed me that it was back to normal by showing me the watch and how much charge it had; claims that it had a 95% charge.  I left it overnight and when I found it around 7 AM, the device was completely off and no active sensors on the back. The whole square watch (front & back) was hot to the touch.  I notice there are teeny-tiny droplets of condensation on the sensor windows, at the back of the watch.  I called FitiBit  customer service and they were very courteous and efficient.  They sent me a return label so I can have it returned and a new one will be sent back to me. I'll be hesitant to used this again in the pool, but I'll probably make that mistake again.  And if I do, I'll update this review.Prior to the pool, I was happy with this device.  I loved that it reminds me to get up and be active.  I love that I can check weather on my watch.  I also love that the steps I take and the distance I have covered is tracked daily.  I miss it.  I can't wait to have my Versa back."", ""I like it so far but I've found the Fitbit app to be a little more complex than it needs to be. The only watch basically does what its advertised to do so if you're looking for a watch that tracks your steps and exercising, this watch is a good one to go with. Here are some of the cons I've experienced so far:1. Not syncing properly with 3rd party app - I use the Loseit! app to track my food, calories, etc and was really excited to have a device that synced to that app so I wouldn't have to enter in exercise manually. It has never worked properly. None of my exercises from the watch show up in the Loseit! App even though some of the burned calories do. Through lots of troubleshooting and research, I've found this is more of a problem with the Fitbit app rather than LoseIt!. I still haven't found a resolution.2. Some data isn't listed correctly in the app - You can view all the exercise you've done inside of the fitbit app. For some reason it doesn't list the calories burned for some exercises though. For example, a 30 minute walk from a few days ago shows calories burned, but 60 min of biking from yesterday does not. Both were tracked the same way on the watch.  There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to why it shows for some and not other. I've looked on several forums where other people have been experiencing the same thing too. It's super annoying.3. The Fitbit app can be cumbersome - The fitbit app has a lot of features but it definitely is made more complex than it needs to be. I am very tech savvy but still had a problem figuring out what certain features do what and how to navigate it properly.UPDATE:I'm editing this review after having used the watch for about 7 months or so. Last month my watch started experiencing battery problems. It went from only needing to be charged every 4 days, to now needing to be charged more than once a day. After less than a week of this my watch would no longer power on or charge. I spoke to FitBit customer service who replaced my watch. I had to wait almost 4 weeks for the new watch to be mailed to me. Once I got the refurbished replacement, I was extremely disappointed to find that the replacement had touch screen issues. The watch was completely unreponsive to touch. I contacted FitBit customer service again who then sent me out ANOTHER refurbished replacement. Thankfully this time they overnighted it to me. When I got the second replacement, there was a big red X on the screen and it would not boot past it. After a couple of hours of internet searches and reading forums, I was able to figure out how to get it working and synced and a week later it seems to be working fine. I am really angry that a watch I spent over $200 for would stop working completely after only 6 months. I understand that sometimes thing can go wrong with electronics, but I can confidently say that it's very unlikely I will be buying another Fitbit again in the future."", 'UPDATE AT BOTTOM-So first with opening the package, it was missing one of the extra watch bands. After some issues getting the Versa to sync- I charged it and had a lovely hour and a half with it before it completely shut off and starting heating up. I took it off and it continued to heat up even hotter. Called Fitbit support and they’re having me send it back and 5-10 business days after they have looked at it, they’ll send me a replacement that’ll take up to 2 weeks to get to me.... I really hope I just got a bad one but regardless- not happy about this purchase even though I’ve been in love with Fitbit in the past.UPDATE I’m just exchanging to Amazon instead. But it looks like it’ll take even longer to get a replacement (May 31 😭😭😭)UPDATE UPDATE 😆- I returned the original to amazon (still waiting for a refund...) and went ahead and bought one in a color I didn’t want at Target in person. I had the Blaze before and this is basically a waterproof one piece blaze. The first few days the heart rate, stairs, and steps were totally off but now after a few days it’s seemed to normalize. Sometimes the watch says my stats are different than the app says, even after syncing. And the app is constantly telling me to connect my watch to WiFi (which it is usually. Stay at home mom here). I’m happy to have a Fitbit again but it definitely didn’t live up to the hype.']"

I had to return/exchange the Charge 2 as the step count was wildly inaccurate. Fitbit advised that this was a defect and provided a new device promptly. However, the new device had the exact same issue.  Both Charge 2’s have been returned.I then broadened my research beyond Fitbit products and was stunned to learn at how much more I could get for my money if I opened my mind beyond the popular Fitbit product line. I ended up purchasing a Samsung Gear Fit 2 and am very happy I did.I’ve used the Charge 2 and Gear Fit 2 each for at least a month, and here’s my take on how they compare -*Accuracy:This is the main deciding factor for me. The Charge 2 was wildly inaccurate (keep in mind, I received 2 devices from Fitbit as noted above – both with the same issue). It consistently missed over 1,500 steps a day and counted steps while I slept somehow.  My Fitbit One didn’t have this issue. Fitbit customer support suggested I place the Charge 2 in my pocket for improved accuracy, which completely negated the purpose of upgrading from the One to the Charge 2.The Gear Fit 2 is pretty spot on. I say ‘pretty’ because the only time it’s slightly off is when I walk in place, and that’s OK with me because I’m cheating anyway…  It also accurately counts repetitions when using the different Exercise features (lunges, crunches, squats), which is really cool and helpful.*Features/Functionality:The Gear Fit 2 is the clear winner here.  The biggest reason is that if you’re looking to keep track of how you’re doing with your fitness goals, even if you’re just casually trying to improve your fitness level, it really makes it easy by improving awareness. For example, when viewing any item such as floors or steps, not only do you see today’s activity, but you also see how you did for the rest of the week at a glance. Tapping on those screens displays the detail by day. You can get more detail on the exercise done (map, etc) if you want to from these screens as well. There's really not much of a need to use the app with the Gear Fit 2.The Charge 2 will display this detail within the app only, as far as I know.I tried the guided breathing feature on the Charge 2 a few times and didn’t really find any value in it. To each their own.The Gear Fit 2 has built in GPS (no phone required!), so once you’re done with your run/walk/hike, you can view your route, distance, average MPH and much more, right on your wrist.MyFitnessPal works really well with the Gear Fit 2 so you can quick add foods directly from your wrist and log water intake with a couple of taps.With the Gear Fit 2, I can play music from my phone or store music directly on the device. I can view/dismiss Alarms directly from the screen. I love the ability to set a button to quick launch a feature. I use it to quick launch an Exercise, so all I have to do is press the button, and I’m off! On the Charge 2, you’d have to tap thru the screens, then press/hold to launch the Exercise - this was kind of a PITA for me and I usually forgot to do it before I set off on my adventure.One thing that I really love, which may not be a big deal to many other folks, is the ability to quickly set the Gear Fit 2 to ‘do not disturb’ mode. This means that the all alerts are muted and device won’t wake when you move your wrist. It’s great to use when sleeping so you don’t light up the room at night!*Comfort:The Gear Fit 2 blows the Charge 2 away here. You can tell by the photo that the Charge 2 doesn’t sit flush to the wrist area, largely due to the lumpy bottom and straight face. This made me abundantly aware that I had something on my wrist every second of every day that I wore it. It was downright painful to wear while sleeping if I put any pressure on that wrist (if I slept on that side). When I took the Charge 2 off to charge it or shower, I had a visible indentation mark on my wrist from it (and I wasn’t wearing it too tight).The Gear Fit 2 has a curved display with a flush bottom that I forgot I was wearing once the novelty of playing with it wore off. It’s comfortable to wear while sleeping and while active.*Customization: It’s kind of a split here, but I’d have to say that overall, the Gear Fit 2 wins.The Charge 2 has the advantage over the Gear Fit 2 in the band category since there are so many different bands to choose from. I’m really not sure why there aren’t more available for the Gear Fit 2, but I will say that I’m happy with the options that I’ve found.  There’s a great magnetic Milanese one out there that I love. And, for anyone else who’s lost some thumbnails – it’s easier to remove the original Gear Fit 2 band if you bend it backwards a little bit:)The Gear Fit 2 wins over the Charge 2 with respect to the customization features available directly within the device. For example, with the Gear Fit 2, the biggest difference is that you have a color screen. So, you have a whole world of options open to you for different clock screens. I can easily change mine each day to match my outfit. Then, there are all the different apps you can download and use right on your wrist (such as MyFitnessPal and Workout Trainer).*Battery Life:It’s a draw.  Some complain that the Gear Fit 2 has too short of a battery life, but that’s not been a problem for me. I set the screen brightness to 3, which is still plenty bright, and use a clock face with a mostly black background. Maybe I get more life out of it since I put it on 'do not disturb' mode at night too…  I was getting about 3 days of use out of the Charge 2 which is about the same as I’m getting for the Gear Fit 2.*Fitness Goals:I didn’t really find many features within the Charge 2 that would encourage me to push to meet my fitness goals. Although I did like how the Charge 2 had automatic reminders to move 10 minutes before each hour.The Gear Fit 2 does one better by having reminders every 50 minutes, which is a bit more personalized.  I’ve set an exercise as a quick launch, which has been super helpful. I have also found myself using the other exercise tracking features often, just because the device has the ability to do them (for example, crunches, squats, etc). Maybe it’s just me, but knowing I have the ability to track it with a tap on my wrist is encouragement enough.*TL;DR - Summary:For me, the clear winner is the Gear Fit 2. I absolutely love it.I can’t for the life of me figure out why so many folks love the Fitbit Charge 2, after having had 2 that were totally inaccurate.  One conclusion I’ve arrived at is that many may prefer the Fitbit to other devices just like some prefer iPhone to Android. Just a matter of preference. Fitbit is basic, simple and stripped down versus the Gear Fit 2, which is feature loaded and very customizable. It can be overwhelming to some that just want a device that comes out of the box with no other options.Personally, I love the mere fact that the Gear Fit 2 is accurate in addition to the additional features, having the ability to customize and the ease of use that the Gear Fit 2 has versus the Charge 2."", 'Smartwatches have had a difficult journey --especially in 2016.  Expected sales have been half of projected, and when billions of revenue dollars and market size are the object of investors this does not bode well.  This was made all the more real by apple’s own disappointing apple watch sale figures, and even more depressing Fitbit’s poor fiscal year and necessary consolidation with Pebble (Question: is being bought a symbol of growth or rescue?).Admittedly, watches in general have become less of a necessity with certain younger demographics tied to their cell phones and less conscious of what is on their wrist, whether utilitarian, nerdy, or fashion trendy.  Of course, when we can put in our “smart contact lenses” and experience as much “overlay”, interaction, and connectivity we might desire, without looking down at anything, in the privacy of our own world and outside of the transitory “google glass” solution, the beginning of the end of smartphones is inevitable!  I, for one, look forward to this Terminator style overlay, but with less red coloration, and more “Minority Report” interactivity.So the smart watch industry continues to try to make inroads into the same demographic that might not want a watch, but would want a device that gives an active, youthful, and free feeling—more dynamic less utilitarian.  “Active” is the sense that actual activity is truly measured and quantified.  “Free feeling” in that you do not need to carry around your phone everywhere you go or more simply, that you do not need to look at it to acknowledge messages or phone calls (voice, how quaint!).  For apple, the do it all smart phone substitute is their watch.  The apple watch is nice.  The screen is bright, application rich, and reportedly provides good accuracy during activities.  I would not know, I do not have one.  I do not want one until the battery life improves significantly.  What good is an activity watch that you cannot wear continuously for at least 24 hours to track activity and sleep?  That, and the price… oh lordy, the price of entry is high, even for the base models.Enough commentary!  For some background, I have/had a number of these devices.Way back in the old days, I had a Polar watch with a chest band.  These devices were (and continue to be) the go to items for accurate HRM during activity.  Long on battery life, but way short on apps and connectivity in those days.Then there was an Epson product that seemed out of their normal printer based business model. It was a basic band providing a couple of lights showing and tracking activity with a heart rate monitor (hereafter, HRM) and requiring connection to your phone for exercise tracking.  It provided inconsistent HR data during certain activities (for me, stationary bike riding showed wildly inaccurate measurements), but did seem to provide interesting sleep information.Then, a basic and early Fitbit band, without HRM, which worked OK for tracking but in the end I needed more display—why wear a watch and a band with no HRM? The variable reviews for the higher end HRM Fitbit did not prompt me to purchase one, along with a lack of an app universe and less than exciting displays.That led to a Pebble.  Notably a “Pebble Time” purchased during a kickstarter campaign.  The Pebble Time has an always on color display, that only looks better outside in bright sunlight (less so inside), has pretty good 3-5 days of battery life, a great app and developer space, with acceptable activity tracking (minus HRM) and OK looks.  If Pebble had lasted and carried through with their kickstarter project to provide a model like this with HRM, I would have purchased one. But no, about the same time that Pebble was supposed to carry through with that product, Fitbit bought them up –but not for their hardware acumen, but to give Fitbit a necessary app and developer community. Fitbit has not provided any solid hints they will provide a similar device to the one that Pebble did not deliver.  (I do love my Pebble, and do know that the Pebble 2 with HRM is probably a great watch—but alas, no color? And no future?!).That finally brings me to what I have realized is most important to me in any of these devices.  I want a clear, colorful, and configurable display.  The variety and changeability of watch faces was my initial and continuous draw to any of these watches.  It needs to be accurate, and I do want HRM.  It needs a proper interface on a larger screen for control and setup.  It does not need to always be on, but it does need to come on when I need it. Being a Pebble fan, touchscreens were less important, but that may be changing since I got the Samsung Fit2.  (Finally, he is talking about the Samsung!?).The Samsung Gear devices, and notably the Fit2 had been on my list. I was waiting for Gear to provide apple iOS support outside of the android phones AND acceptable battery life.  I was already familiar with Samsung’s gear community and my primary need for configurable watch faces. Samsung checked off iOS support in February 2017 (finally!) providing a basic app for iPhone.  I started watching for Amazon Warehouse open box deals since I did not feel like spending full price on yet another disappointment.  When a 50% off deal showed up (with acceptable condition notes), I jumped.I have had the Fit2 for about a week now.  Maybe not a lot of time to comment, but still:What I like:*Super bright display under most conditions (see below)*Enough available watch faces to make me happy*Screen that does seem to come on when I want it*Good accuracy for HRM, in general and during exercise compared to my exercise bike monitor.*The iOS app works (see below)*The Samsung developer app is pretty nice for watch face and apps (but see below)*I like having a touchscreen!*The on watch touch and button based interface is mostly intuitive.What I do not like:*The Samsung iOS app is very basic and needs much work compared to their own android based app (and compared to the Pebble OS app).**Additionally the iOS app is not fully implemented, not providing expected functionality across the entire Samsung GearApp marketplace. Looking for Broda or Infinity watch faces? No access provided, and the providers say directly that Samsung must provide that full access?  That is very poor implementation.  Come on Samsung, allow iOS users access to the full market place.*In same area, the health tracking application needs more work with more detailed and configurable (maybe downloadable) datasets, along with potential interactivity with other apps like “my fitness pal”.*The display is harder to read in direct sunlight, and the main display cannot be set to “always on”. (You can see an always on default basic hour:min lower power display if you choose). I need to be able to time certain operations for short periods of time over a minute but less than 10 minutes with my main face, and without flicking my wrist to bring my watch back up.*Needs a wider app space, with yet more watch faces AND the ability for a user to create their own watch faces in the developer app without needing to register for the Samsung marketplace and developer space (I just want to create watch faces and upload them to my watch without putting them up on the Samsung GalaxyApps seller space.  And so far, Samsung has been non-responsive for my own submissions—stalled in “registration” status.  What gives?).What I am neutral on:*The looks.  It is less watch and more sports band.*Battery life is average, with my use, at best 2-3 days.*Perceived durability.  Everything seems solid so far, but I am wary based on surrounding reviews.What I would recommend:Buy one—even at the retail price, it seems a good value! Even more so if you can find an acceptable open box from Amazon Warehouse to try. You may like it, especially if you are looking for an alternative to Fitbit or apple devices.Also buy a screen protector with your Fit2 like\xa0\nSamsung Gear Fit2 Screen Protector, IQ Shield LiQuidSkin (6-Pack) Full Coverage Screen Protector for Samsung Gear Fit2 (Gear Fit 2) HD Clear Anti-Bubble Film - with\n...There are a number of examples of cracked screens out there--protect your watch from the beginning.What do I really want?  My color Pebble Time 2 with HRM!  Oh well.  4/5.', ""I used to wear a Garmin Vivofit HR, and decided to get this because it offered more functionality and a nicer display. I also got an asus Zenwatch 2 at the same time here are my impressions vs the Garmin, vs the Asus.Screen: this is where this watch shines, vivid colors, very responsive also. Much better color and brightness than the Asus. The Garmin is just 1 color, so not really a fair comparison, but as the Garmin display is always on without killing the battery, I'd say it's a preference thing.Convenience: I actually found the Garmins always on display to be the most convenient. Even though the display wasn't as bright, I found it easier to just shade in the sun to see than to wiggle my wrist to wake the Samsung. Their twist to show display works pretty well (a lot better than the asus) but still not flawless especially if laying down. Plus it tends to lite up while driving or if I move my arm while trying to sleep, and as the screen is very bright, it can be glaring.Battery; I'm pretty disappointed on this mark. The Garmin gets about 5-6 days always on my wrist, display always on. The Samsung gets about 1.5 days. Once the battery gets broken in it may get to 2 days, but that's still disappointing especially with the screen being off 90% of the time. The Asus is the worst I can only manage about 12 hours with minimal use and the most dim display I could find.Notifications: I do like the Samsungs notifications the best by far. If you have a notice/email/message, it just shows a yellow dot in the corner, swipe and you can scroll through multiple items. You can also read entire emails and messages on the watch face. The Garmin is OK, but you have to pretty much open and connect to their connect app to get them, which is annoying. The Asus is OK, but it always pops up a bar at the bottom which covers 2 of my watch face indicators(battery life and temp) and even after swiping it away or opening, shows back up after reawaken the display.Functions: believe it or not, given that the Samsung is about half the size, it does seem to do everything and more of the Asus, and seems to flow better from menu to menu. All basically do the same things, weather, notifications, answer/end calls activity performance tracker, step/stair tracker. I believe the Asus has a speaker and mic, but I have yet to use them.Connecting: as I said previous, the Garmin is annoying because everything goes through their connect app which closes itself daily, but even when disconnected the watch works fine for me. The Samsung seems to connect and work with my galaxy s6 just fine. The Asus isn't great. It seems to connect and disconnect on its own, only being 15' away, and I think the software is the most glitchy.Looks: depending on what your going for. The Garmin is pretty utilitarian, skinny but kinda bulky . The Samsung is the most form fitting and sleek, but still looks like a fitness tracker. The Asus is probably my favorite here. It is bulkier, but I can swap on a silicon band for working out, a leather band for work, or a stainless steel link band to dress it up, as they are just standard 19mm bands, they are readily available and fairly inexpensive. The stainless steel bezel is also more elegant than the black plastic of the fitness  geared ones.HR monitor. There isnt one on the asus. On the other two this is just a battery drain IMHO. They're both fairly accurate, and even if they come up wrong, a simple adjustment or wiping my wrist off fixes this.  If your a serious athlete I would recommend a fingertip o2/hr reader. I have found these the most accurate and are only like $20. Unless I'm really training for an event I rarely care to see what my heart rate is throughout the day.Durability: a lot of people complain about the band on the Garmin, but I have had good luck with it so far. I've been wearing it 24/7 (minus the 1 hour or so per week I need to charge it) I've had it just over a year and the rubber piece that holds the band tail just broke, but us still wearable. Both it and the Samsung are proprietary bands, so your pretty limited to what you can find to fit them. The Samsung band is horrible. It's as bad as the other reviews say. Constantly popping out of place, I also just broke the rubber loop the band passes through after only wearing for about 3 weeks.  I would recommend getting a metal type clasp band when you order. The Asus I would say wins as it has the protection of the bezel and bands are standard 19mm, plus the one that comes with it seems pretty good.Waterproof. I believe the Asus and Garmin are IP67, think Samsung is rated less, but they tend to underrated their products. I know for sure the Garmin is good to go, I've taken it snorkeling for a couples to 4m plus on many occasions and never an issue. I've only had the Asus and Samsung in the pool and shower with no issues.Fitness; Probably the Samsung. It's lightweight, stores music to play on Bluetooth headphones so the phone can stay home. I have not used the GPS feature, but have heard it's hit or miss, but at this price and form factor, that's to be expected. Asus also stores music but is heavier and bulkier which makes my wrist sweat and uncomfortable . The Garmin is more no frills, can controll music from your phone, but doesn't store music.  Does well with distance once you get it setup right.All and all my take on what each watch is best for:Garmin: basic phone control functions, always on display that isn't going to wake you up in the middle of the night when the display comes on. Good for someone like me who wears a watch 24/7, wants to keep tabs on how active they are day in and day out, but doesn't really need the frills (and thus limited battery life) of the other watches.Samsung: a mix of both, nice display better notifications  and phone control, and with some adjustment can be a great all around daily wear and fitness watch. Just have to get used to daily charging.Asus; really just the best entry level smart watch out there especially for the price. Probably has more functionality than I give it credit, I just get impatient, I feel they should just plug and play. Does pretty much everything, just not any one thing great. But still, you could buy this and the Samsung for less than an apple watch and get more features between the two.All good watches at this price, you won't feel cheated with any of them."", 'I\'m usually an early adopter of new tech but I waited a bit to get a smartwatch/wearable. I was keeping an eye open for the moment that wearables became viable for me as a real tool and not just as a vanity tech item, and I believe the Gear Fit 2 is it.Picked up a Gear Fit 2 from Amazon. @$150 and so far that seems like a steal. The fitness trackers  I\'ve used (calorie, step, heart rate) all work well, syncd up with the Gear app on my phone ( Nexus 6) with no problems, S Health app works well and the sleep tracker is an amazing little ""Never knew I needed it till I got it"" kind of thing. Battery life hasn\'t been an issue at all, with a pretty good bit of use I still haven""t used more than 60% of the charge in a single day. Charging is relatively fast and convenient.The alarm was the most unexpected perk. I\'ve always needed a very loud audio alarm to wake me up, and sometimes that\'s still not enough. The silent, gentle vibration from the wristband has yet to fail to rouse me, and no one else gets disturbed.I\'m a grill cook by trade, so I was worried about the extremes of kitchen life. So far so good. I have a wireless blue tooth speaker paired to my phones Poweramp media player (MP3\'s on my phones internal memory)  to provide tunes to the kitchen. The media player app on my Fit 2 acts like a remote for my phone, changes songs, volume etc. which comes in handy at times I can\'t come off the line to do it on my phone. It\'s also nice to receive remote notifications from my various conversations across several messaging apps ( txt, Facebook, email, Twitter) so even though I can\'t engage in a full conversations, from time to time, I can at least monitor things like running conversations from group chats and make sure that the last text that came in wasn\'t some emergency or situation that needs my immediate attention. A few reviews I read  while I was researching before purchase said the band had a tendency to come unfastened, but so far it hasn\'t happened a single time in all the reaching, grabbing, flipping, turning and general motion and abuse required from me throughout the night at work. The streamlined, minimalist design of the watch and band work for me as well. Not a lot of places for food to get trapped and you can imagine how nice the water resistance is in a busy kitchen.There are a few things that aren\'t 100% yet. The Spotify app for the Fit 2 does not work for me. It downloaded to my phone using the Gear app and installed on the Fit 2 just fine, but when I attempt to actually open the app on my Fit 2, it will open Spotify on my phone, but on the Fit 2 it says ""Unable to start Spotify BT dissconnected"" although the BT is in fact not dissconnected.  I Googled it and at the time of this review it seems to be a known bug, but I can\'t tell how common it is, so maybe see if a search returns any info on your specific phone if thats\'s a deal breaker. I will add that the Fit 2 Media Player will actually still remotely control general playback from Spotify on my phone the same way it controls my Poweramp/internal MP3\'s on my phone, but i don\'t get to browse songs/playlists etc. Just general track forward and back, volume pause and so forth. I can live with that, but I do hope the bug gets a fix soon. The full use of Spotify\'s functionality available remotely would be great. Also the advertised ability to stream songs from my phone to the FIt and then to wireless earbuds doesn\'t work. It may be a Spotify only thing, and if so then it obviously won""t work until the previous bug gets fixed, but I can tell you that it doesn\'t work trying to stream songs from my phone in my gym bag to my Fit @ on my wrist and then to my wireless earbuds (proximity is king with the wireless headphones).The software involved in all of this is really sort of ""Still getting it together"". The Gear app keeps trying to get me to change certain permissions EVERY time I open it. There\'s apparently no way to remove some of the notifications from displaying on the home screen ( inactivity, loss of blue tooth connectivity) no matter what the settings are. Some of the on/off switches seemed unintuitive ( ""I thought the slash meant off, but it\'s lit up, now so I don\'t know?!?!?!"") and it takes some work to get everything set as close to perfect as you\'d like.  It would be nice to be able to change the time my ""Day"" starts for the tracking apps. Counts run from midnight to midnight, but my day, unfortunately, doesn\'t. I work nights so my day runs from 3pm to 7am.  I can\'t for the life of me figure out how to change this, but it would sure help when tracking calories etc.Also, the UI is a little stale right out of the box. I have to keep reminding myself that the Fit 2 was primarily designed as a piece of sports gear, and the various screens and apps show it. Information is supplied in easy to read, if not attractive ways. Third party clock faces and apps do help to curb the utilitarian feel of the Fit 2 a bit, but that\'s another area you can feel is not quite all there. I like making my FIt look like a Pip Boy as much as the next guy, but finding usable functionality app that\'s attractive AND reliable still seems a bit away.All that having been said, this is still an amazing piece of kit. Within the span of a week it has already almost seamlessly established itself through use and convenience as part of my daily life.  Watch, alarm, timer, calorie counter, remote notifications and music management.  It does so much, so well for so little, and even though there are still kinks to work out, I can say that the Samsung Gear Fit 2 is the affordable and reliable wearable that I waited for: A great starting point.', ""My husband and several of my friends have a Fitbit and they swear by it. So when offered the opportunity to try the Samsung Gear Fit2, I thought why not? Maybe this will motivate me to get in shape. I always have good intentions when it comes to getting fit and in shape, but I don’t always stay on task or follow-through. So maybe this gadget will be just the thing I need to motivate me and hold me accountable. This review is based on the novice exercise enthusiast. So keep this in mind when reading this review. It really depends on what you are looking for in a fitness gadget.Now for the review.Downloading the program: I have an android (LG) phone. The program was easy to download. I didn’t have any problems. You can do everything from the app from locating the Gear Fit2 to sending music to it.Appearance: In appearance, it’s like a traditional fitness tracker. I love the color (blue). It's a unisex color. I wouldn't describe the color as either royal or navy, but a muted blue that matches most items of clothing. Nice option instead of the traditional black. The band is adjustable and comfortable.  In terms of size, in my opinion, the face itself is slightly wider than my husband’s Fitbit. The default face is a traditional clock, but you can change the look/appearance pretty easily (under settings) and there are some cool options. I really like that you can change the font and the size of the device as well. This is a great feature us middle agers who have trouble reading small print. Everything that can be done on this device is at a “touch”. You simply swipe back and forth, and select. It is super easy.Charging: You charge this device via a wall charger that connects to the Gear magnetically. I probably would have preferred to connect into the device versus via magnets, but it isn’t a deal breaker. I haven’t had any trouble and it appears to keep a decent charge (remember I am a novice, so for those hardcore fit people, you may want to read other reviews).Features:  (1) When connected to Bluetooth, when you receive a call, you will get a notification (i.e., the name of the person that is calling you) on the screen. You can set the notifications to buzz, vibrate, etc.(2) You can also connect to your music via Bluetooth.(3) You can set your profile (under settings) quickly from the device. This information includes: gender, age, height or weight. I like this feature because this allows me to share the device with my teenage sons. When they use it, they can simply change the profile (information) from me to them and enjoy it too.(4) You can monitor your heart rate, as well as your calories burned.(5) There is a cool exercise log. It breaks it down by day and tells you the total number of steps, etc. This allows you to monitor the number of steps and or floors that you take per day.(6) It can monitor your caffeine intake. You merely enter the cups.(7) There is a stopwatch and timer feature. So if you are doing some kind of specialized training….let’s say an hour of cardio or walking, you won’t have to keep looking at your watch for the time, you simply set the timer.(8) You can set the individual activity (i.e., running, walking, hiking, pilates, yoga, squats, elliptical, exercise bike etc.). I was pretty impressed with this feature. I think that it is helpful to compare the exact exercise with the amount of energy you are exerting. There was such a wide variety of exercises available that you surely will find one that suits your needs. When I asked my husband, he said that his fitbit only monitors walking or running. So for those hardcore fitness folks, this might be a plus for purchasing this product.(9) You can monitor your target time, distance or number of calories burned easily.(10) There is a 24 hour activity log that breaks down when you’re active or resting/sleep. It divides it by date, day and number of calories. This is helpful when trying to determine where you need to pick up the pace.(11) There is also an indication of the temperature outside as well as your general location (i.e., city).My husband says that some of the features that I have on my device, he cannot see unless his Fitbit is connected to the computer. I like that Samsung has made certain features convenient for the consumer. And he said some of the detailed features he doesn’t even have.Overall, I am satisfied with the limited stuff that I have done with the Samsung Gear Fit2. It’s a cool little gadget. But I like I tried to explain in the beginning, it depends on what you are looking for in a fitness monitoring device. While slightly more expensive than the Fitbit Charge, you will have to decide if the differences in features warrant the price. And finally, only time will tell if it provides me the motivation to really dig deep and work out consistently. But it won’t be because I don’t have the tools to do it."", 'At $70 this is the best smart watch you could buy.A quick bit about my experiences with the Fit 1:  After owning the Fit gen1 for the better part of 2 years, I was really apprehensive about giving samsung another shot. The Fit 1 was an overpriced piece of garbage, it never worked right, required me using OpenFit instead of the gear manager to make it work with my note 4 at the time, and when I tried to syncing it to my wife\'s G6 edge, it updated and went into a bootloop; I manually updated it, and it worked for a few days then it just stopped.-----------------So, onto the fit2. It\'s a whole different monster, my relationship with the device is still very new, I\'ve had it a few days now, but off the cusp it\'s sleeker, sexier, and a far more functional peripheral. I have an LG V20 now, not my favorite phone as I\'ve carrying the note line since v2, but it\'s nice enough for an LG device. After downloading the gear manager and accompanying plug-ins the fit2 promptly connected with the V20, opening up and allowing me to choose a watch face and peruse the gear app market.I\'m a little put off at all the microtransactions, software these days is just expensive, $1 for an app that makes a difference in your life somehow is justifiable, $4 for a game, acceptable, $2 for a watch face... not-so-much. That said, there are plenty of beautiful free watch faces.I digress.The battery life is better than the F1\'s, as the F1 needed to be charged pretty constantly even under minimal usage. I also had to keep it in lock mode as the face flipped on constantly and would wake me up in the middle of the night, drain the battery even faster, etc. On an average week I\'d have to charge the F1 3 to 4 times; meaning the battery life on a full charge was about 2 days, sometimes 2.5. At the time of writing this, the Fit 2 has gone 4 days before I put it on the charger, and it was at 18%; using a live background and having the heart monitor on auto.I turned off the GPS, I don\'t use the onboard music storage, and while I keep the other auto-functions on as well, they don\'t seem to impact the battery much.Pros:The heart rate monitor is acceptably accurate, doing manual readings with a nurse downstairs on the top of my wrist and the bottom, it was consistently within 2-6 bpm to her readings. If you\'re like me and tend to become hypertensive when your blood pressure is being taken, it\'s really nice to be able to look at your watch and see that contrary to your in setting readings, you\'re well within normal-exceptional due to the auto-readings. In clinic resting heart rate, 80 bpm, average reading, 48-60.The sleep monitor is actually pretty, well, ""neat"". On the F1 it was useless, here when I awake the F2 lets me know (very accurately) how long I was asleep, what my heart rate was during said sleep, and it rates it on quality (not that accurate). The other night it stated I\'d been asleep for 7.5 hours, which was pretty accurate, but I woke up exhausted from tossing and turning, and it stated the sleep was 91% restful.The pedometer is surprisingly accurate, and the watch can tell the difference between me taking the stairs (it rates them in flights) v walking (steps, obviously). I\'ve never been much of a runner, I hated it when I did it regularly, now I stick to stairs and I walk a lot by proxy of being in hospitals throughout the week.I haven\'t tested some of the features like the water tracker, calorie tracker, etc, because they\'re superfluous to me. I don\'t need an app to tell me how much water I should drink, takes ten seconds to check your hydration levels manually, and if you\'re mouth is dry, drink something. If you\'re escalating your heart rate into your optimum range, you can expect you\'re burning about 500 calories an hour on average...Aesthetics, the watch looks nice, I wear a suit most days, lab coats come and go, dress down when I know I can, mostly still business casual. I used to take the F1 off or flip it face down because it was unsightly. I\'ve not only not felt that need with the Fit 2, I\'ve had people ask me what smartwatch it is, and go on to compliment me on it.Cons:I can\'t really name any given what I paid for it. It\'s a pretty fantastic device all things considered.Overall I can say that at $70 I am perfectly happy with the purchase, I\'d probably complain a little if I\'d paid $150-200 because I don\'t really see THAT significant a difference between this device and cheaper alternatives (of which my wife has owned many) aside from build quality and metric and HR accuracy.It\'s durable, the battery life is acceptable, functions are functional, and it\'s aesthetically pleasing no matter the occasion. At the speed in which wearable and portable tech upgrades/updates these days I have issues making overtly expensive investments, being a family man these days $300\'s a year on throwaway tech isn\'t as viable as it was when you could regift something and the recipient appreciated it. Now, if you give your 9 year old a last gen tablet they roll their eyes and you get a ""thanks Dad"" that means as much as a resigned, monotoned sigh of disapproval can.', 'I was so excited when I saw that Samsung had come out with a Gear Fit2 app for the iPhone.  Yay!  I had been researching wearables, and even purchased a Fitbit and Gear Fit2 at the same time to see which one would work best for me.  I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY wanted the Gear Fit2 to be the clear winner.  It certainly was the winner on appearance, comfort, and extra features.  The screens are very attractive, intuitive, and should allow for tracking of most everything you need.  That said - I mostly wanted this device for the integrated GPS.  I\'m a pretty casual runner, but I don\'t always want to bring my phone along on a run, and I really don\'t want to be pulling it out of my pocket all the time to check my pace, distance, etc.  And I also wanted sometime to routinely track steps throughout the day and remind me to get up off the couch at night. So this watch seemed like the perfect answer!Unfortunately, the one thing that made the Gear Fit2 most attractive to me - the onboard GPS - does not work worth a damn.  Though it is really good at running down your battery.  :-(  I have no idea whether my issues are iOS-related or just common issues with the Gear Fit2.  But here are my experiences in using it on a walk and/or run: - Paired with iPhone: The first few times I took it out, I brought my phone along to see how it would compare to MapMyRun, which is extremely accurate.  Distance on the Gear Fit 2 was consistently short by more than 10%.  (At the one mile mark, it was reading 0.88 miles.  After two miles, it was only giving me credit for 1.75.)  I tried different routes, walking/running, and it was always short.  Which of course, made my pace look really sad too.  Darn!!  I was pleasantly surprised though, on my first two outings to see that I was getting credit for ""stars climbed"" on some of the really steep hills.  I thought it was nice that the device recognized the difference between a steep and gradual incline and gave me extra credit on those tough hills.  Unfortunately, that only happened on two occasions, and it no longer gives me ""stairs"" credit - even on the exact same routes. - Not paired with iPhone: I thought I\'d try the device on its own and leave the phone at home.  The result?  I got 0.0 miles credit and 0 stairs counted on a 1.2 mile steep walk.  Gah!  It did, however, count my steps, so I guess there was SOME value-add.  (Note: my husband and I got matching devices. On this particular walk, he got credit for 10 stairs and .98 miles (out of 1.2 miles - so it was still short, but at least his walk was registering).) - Auto tracking of exercise: I\'ve had mixed results here.  When I got frustrated and just thought, ""What the hell, I\'m not even turning this thing on,"" I actually got better results than when I tried to track exercise.  The device picked up on the fact that I was walking briskly and it tracked the steps and time walked.  Distance was still short by more than 10%, and no stair-credit given, but hey, I\'ll take what I can at this point.If I could manually add distance and stairs (like I can add cups of water and coffee), I wouldn\'t be quite so disappointed with this device.  I could ""fix"" the stats after exercise and accurately track performance over time.  As it stands now, I will be continuing to use MapMyRun to track all of my walks/runs.  And I guess I\'ll just use the Gear Fit2 as a step tracker.  In which case, I sure wish I\'d have kept the Fitbit.  Sigh.  I gave it to my mom after I tried out each device for one day and settled on the Gear Fit2.  She\'s loving the Fitbit (Charge2).  LOL.Also - if you\'re an iPhone user, you should know that not all functionality is available via iOS.  I cannot find a way to add \'friends\' for challenges or even simple comparisons.  :-(  And the S Health app doesn\'t look the same on my iPhone 6 as it does on the Samsung screen shots.  So I guess they rolled out a \'bare bones\' app for the iPhone, and hopefully they will continue to update it.  Basic old iHealth is better than this S Health version that I got.  About 80% of the time I click on the S Health ""run"" history to check out the stats, the whole app freezes and requires a shut down.  The only thing even slightly useful about the S Health app on the iPhone is the sleep tracking.  Who knows how accurate it is... But at least it\'s entertaining to look at and compare with my husband who is keeping me up with his snoring all night while he\'s in deep slumber.  I now have proof!In summary - if everything worked as it should - this would be a great deal at $150!  It looks really nice, has customizable faces, tracks your heart rate, gives you notifications/summaries of emails/texts/calls/FB, etc., and it turns on by just raising your arm (whether sitting still or walking/running - very convenient!).  It\'s like an almost-smart watch, but for a fraction of the cost.  HOWEVER, if the GPS doesn\'t work, and if the apps are never updated appropriately for the iOS, it is probably not a good purchase.  Unless you just want to count your steps and look at fancy screens.  :-)', 'I\'ll leave my review for the Gear Fit 2 since I did not find much on Amazon.ca (but plenty on Amazon.com)This is my personal opinion, I am no expert. I have been wearing and using this watch daily for the past 3 weeks.Should you buy this watch? The best answer I can give you is it depends of what you are expecting from the watch.Pros- Good looking watch if you compare to competitors, you can change the ""watch face"" by downloading some directly from the app ""Samsung Gear Fit"" (some are free, and some you need to pay for)- Easy to use- You can customize most of the display of the watch, what you want to see, or not.- Sync automatically with S health witch is friendly user- Accurate with HR measurement- Automatically recognize when you are active for some activities (preprogram into the watch) - so for example if you go for a walk, it does calculates your speed, distance, HR, and even use the GPS on map (which I did not use yet, so I am not sure of the accuracy of the mapping)-Keep records of your daily activities, HR, how good/bad was your sleep (average bed time, time of sleep), steps, and floors. So you can monitor your activity level on a day basis, weekly basis etc.- You can set goal and the watch tells you when you reached them (number a steps to reach, floors etc.)Cons- Battery life. I am not using the notifications on the watch (like SMS, Facebook, etc.) and average battery life time is 2 days, maximum. I did not try it with the notifications on though, but you should expect less than 2 days.- Bracelet gets easily undone. This problem was known before I actually bought this watch and it does appears on all reviews I read before ordering it. I bought another bracelet on Amazon (Custom) and it works well which kind of fix this issue.- HR monitoring is not constant or continuously. I mean it usually takes your HR every 10 minutes. But you have to remain still for the watch to take the HR. So, it is not rare for me to have like 2 hours without any HR monitoring because I am moving around or something.Personally, I do bodybuilding which means as a workout, I most likely do weight lifting. This watch has some preset activities (walking, running, hiking, cycling, step machine, exercise bike, elliptical trainer, treadmill and some exercises that you have to enter the amounts of reps and sets you want to perform). The specs says that once you have started your ""activity"" the HR monitoring becomes on a continue basis. That being said, for myself, which I have to select ""other workout"" to monitor my activity level , after 3 weeks using this watch, I only have one workout (I usually workout 5 times per week) that was actually monitored my HR while I was working out, and again you have to remain still for the measurement.- Floors measurement is inaccurate, really. I have a desk job, which means I don\'t walk a lot in a day. It is not rare that the watch indicates that I have climb up to 100 floors in a day, which is physically impossible considering my job requirements. I found on Samsung website that it was because of the most recent update of the software, but I can confirm as of today, this issue as not been solved.- The application S Heath is rigid. You can customize some stuff on it yes for sure. But you cannot use other application with this watch. So if you don\'t like this app at first, you are stuck with it anyways.I strongly suggest you to make your researches before buying this device. Personally, I find disappointing that you can\'t have your HR monitored continually, that you can\'t add some kind of physical activities to the ones already preset in the watch and the battery lifetime is a deception as well. If this is what you are looking for by buying a fitness tracker, I suggest to you to look for a Fitbit or other competitors.In other hand, I can say the price is fair for what the watch offers. I\'d say it acts more like a smartwatch than a fitness tracker, but again this is my personal opinion.For the watch itself, I\'d give a 3 stars. Maybe if they do some software updates, I could increase my personal review to 4 stars.There""s plenty reviews on YouTube, comparing different brands, if this could help you to make you choice.', ""Uodate 2/09/2027The picture below shows my easy and cheap fix for the watchband. I just did not want to buy a new wrist band that might or might not fit my tracker. I bought 20 ponytail/braid bands at the drugstore for $2.00. I doubled one over the band and it holds my band snugly and is easy to get off and on.Update 2/05/2017The snow has melted quite a bit, and I found my Gearfit 2 just inside the pasture fence where I throw hay to the horses.  Fortunately, my 1,200 pound Tennessee Walker had not stepped on it. I brought it up to the house, put it on the charger and reconnected it to the Samsung Gear app my phone. So, after 8 days of being buried in the snow with night temps in the upper teens, my Gearfit 2 is working just fine. I am going to order a different band for it, but until it comes, I have taken a bread bag twisty tie and secured my band. Samsung needs to fix this issue and not rely on the cottage industry to pick up the slack.  So many people are not as lucky as I was today to find their watches.Now on to performance.  I do really like this tracker  and maybe because I live out in the country, I am more tolerant of glitchy electronics and intermittent internet connections. #satellitemegalagtimes  #thankyouelectriccoopforrunningfiberoptics  The issues I have with the tracker are: 1. it does not register my stair climbing faithfully.  Sometimes it does the house stairs. Sometimes it doesn't. It almost always gets the elevation change outside from house to barn - equivalent to two flights of stairs. 2. The step count on the Gearfit 2 does not match up with steps on my Samsung Galaxy S5.  The phone always shows more steps. 3. The exercise choices do not match up with the phone. I have horsebackriding on my phone app but not on the tracker. The GPS works well out here in the boonies. I like the many options in settings. I turn off all notifications because I want to prolong battery life - I go two full days and still have battery - and I really don't want to know who is calling, texting, on FB while I am out walking in my gorgeous frozen northland or asleep. Yes, it has a few issues and I can deal with the ball park number of steps and stairs.  It is good for my moderate OCD to not have things perfect. I am grateful that I found it right where my husband said it would probably be. <3  Thank you St. Anthony.  ;)1/29/2017 Man, oh man am I angry and do I ever feel stupid!  I researched the different types of  fitness watch/monitors carefully.  I have probably been looking at different ones for a year now.  Everything about the GearFit 2  was great.  I liked the look, the options, the fact that I didn't have to crane my neck and wrist around to read the data.  It synced beautifully with my Samsung Galaxy phone. It kept accurate steps, sleep, heart beat. In a word, it was FANTASTIC.  You may be wondering why I gave it one star.  IT'S THE WRIST BAND!!  My lovely easy to use fantastic fitness aid is now out in the horse barn, hay barn or under 3 inches of new fallen snow.  I read the reviews and the warnings about the watch falling off people's wrists and disappearing.  I also read that Samsung had improved it with some type of keeper to prevent that.  There is a loop that you pass the band through before fastening it into its slot.  IF THAT WAS THE FIX, IT AINT' ENOUGH!!!  My lovely, I-told-you-so applefitbit friends will certainly get a charge out of this if they find out.  I don't care what people say, I'm just really really angry and feel that I have been cheated by Samsung.  Most of their products are good, but I will not be buying another GearFit2 or any other GearFit.  They are too expensive to have them slip off an disappear.  I will count my own steps and assume that my heart is beating and that I am really sleeping at 4 am.  Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr."", ""Overview: I like the design overall, navigation is pretty intuitive. Some features need tweaking/updating. There will be more to follow as I do more testing. If the GPS starts working right, it’s a solid buy in my opinion, but without it, it’s not really worth the price.The long version :Pro’s:Built in GPSTracks stairs and stepsCan play music to BT headsetMonitors HR throughout dayThe band is comfortableFairly light and not bulkyReminds you to moveGives distance / pace at set intervalsCon’sSensors aren’t calibrated correctlyMust be worn snugBand comes undone easilyCan’t pick your own background  The watch arrives as you’d expect any Samsung product by this point, they now clearly rival Apple for packaging quality. The watch comes pre-charged, which is good because they don’t include a wall charger; you do get a cradle with a USB plug on the end of it. Despite the looks, it isn’t wireless charging, the cradle has small contact points to charge it. As far as battery life, I am at 23% with moderate use over two days which included loading music to it, about an hour of BT audio playing to a headset, and about half an hour of running with the GPS on. If you turn off GPS, don’t play music, and turn off the gesture-wake-up feature there’s no reason a battery shouldn’t last a full 3 days without issue.  The Fit2 comes with a ton of sensors for anything at this price point. That being said, you get what you pay for. The first day of wearing it, I loaded a trailer with 50 bags of wood pellets at 40 LBS each – this was recorded as light activity. Upon arriving home, I carried each bag to my basement, up and down a flight of stairs – 50 trips, it recorded 14 flights for the day – again light duty. The second day was a bit of gym work, push-ups for 160 reps and sit-ups for 170 reps the Fit2 didn’t auto record at any point, and recorded only that the ‘Other workout’ had taken place and counted calories for the times I manually set it to record. Next up was a run, outside, I enabled the GPS, and started the run exercise which gives you a countdown to start. I paused immediately after starting because the GPS hadn’t gotten a fix yet. After 5 minutes or so, I took off running, the GPS never did get a fix. The pace/distance measurement seemed to be more accurate than the Gear2 Neo though. The watch also would pause my music every half mile, read off how many minutes had passed, the distance travelled, and the pace, then resume the music. Even though it is a robot-ish voice and can interrupt a good running song, I decided to leave the feature on. Speaking of songs, you may want to delete the pre-loaded Samsung songs off the watch.  The heartrate sensor monitors your HR throughout the day and throughout your workouts to track what your range is and show where you’re most active. It seemed to be pretty spot on most of the time. There were a few times where immediately after exercise my measured HR would drop from the 180’s to the 60’s and then pick back up – I can tell you this wasn’t actually happening. If the band is worn snug, it tends to stay more accurate more of the time.  The GPS is the main reason I purchased this. I have a Gear2 Neo that I had been using, but the distance measurement was a ways off – especially if you run hills. GPS seems to be the best remedy for this. Unfortunately, I have been unable for it to get a good GPS fix even after 20 minutes in the open. Maybe I need to wait longer for it to get an initial fix, but this seems excessive.  Apps are pretty decent. It syncs well with the S-Health app if you already have a Galaxy S phone and the notifications are presented nicely. I don’t know if it plays nice with other fitness apps yet, but will update as I try them. You can record different types of workouts which is a step better than the Gear2 Neo, but most are limited to working out for time or distance not necessarily weight or reps.  Update: Day 2, today I worked on the elliptical machine averaging a HR of 176 for 45:25. The elliptical machine rated this at 1000 calories. The Fit 2 registered this as 427 calories. I exerted a lot more effort on the elliptical than I normally do on a 5 mile run, which tallies out at between 500 and 600  calories. Also it has counted about 1/4 of the flights of stairs I've climbed today. The sensors are definitely wonky. I suppose if you're trying to lose weight, this is a great device as it low balls calories burned. I also noted that my calculated Basic Metabolic Rate is 2235 calories a day on the Fit2, but when calculated on popular diet and fitness sites this value is much higher Even the S health app calculated it higher which is confusing, you'd think they would use the same calculator. Again, great if you're dieting.""]"

結論・前書き以下は、2022/12/19のスマホアプリ更新と、2022/08/23の本体ソフト更新を反映した内容です。2020/11/27発売後の2年間で、色々改善されたり状況が変わっています。何より普通の腕時計にプラスする形で、スマホ通知を見やすく確認でき、スマホがおサイフ非対応でもwena3で電子マネーが使え、バッテリーも1週間以上持つ。この辺りで満足できるなら、今でも他に代えられない魅力ある製品です。時計ヘッドが無いwena3単体で見ると、スマートウォッチ・バンドとしての基本機能は他製品より弱いです。AppleWatchやWearOSのような高機能さを求める方には、お勧めしません。wena3の活動量計機能は日常生活メインなので、フィットネス重視される方にも、お勧めしません。wena3と同等のSuica決済なら、他にもGarminやFitbit、PixelWatchが。Alexa機能なら、AmazfitやFitbit等、選択肢があります。その辺りの機能が不要なら、XiaomiのSmartBandは五～六分の一の値段で必要十分な機能があります。ですが、他のスマートウォッチ・バンドは今でも、時計を常時表示するとバッテリーが1週間持たないものが大半。常時時間確認できる＆お気に入りの時計ヘッドと合わせると、wena3の魅力が出てくると思います。直近の注意点として、楽天Edy・iD・QUICPay(Suica以外の電子マネー)の初期登録で使うFeliCaのサービス「おサイフリンク」が、2023年12月31日で終了と発表されました。(iDのみ2023年4月下旬に先行終了)終了後は、wena3へ新たに楽天Edy・iD・QUICPayを登録することができなくなります。ただしサービス終了前にwena3へ初期登録していれば、2024年以降も引き続き楽天Edy・iD・QUICPayによる支払いやチャージは可能です。ただ、元々「おサイフリンク」が対応しているiD・QUICPayは古いタイプで(後述)、現在対応するクレカは少なく、またクレカには有効期限もあります。なので、iD・QUICPay目的でこれからwena3を購入するのは、お勧めしません。楽天Edyは有効期限は無いので、2023年中に楽天Edy目的で購入するのは、まだアリかもしれません。また、これはSuicaには関係ない話なので、Suicaは2024年以降も変わらず使えます。wena3の電子マネー関連は、知っておくべき注意事項が色々あるので、以下では最初に電子マネー関連の情報をまとめています。1ユーザーがわかる範囲で書いた内容なので、間違いあったらすいません。その次に、時計ヘッド・メタルバンド・メタル枠関連の情報を。最後に、主にソフト面について私のwena3全体レビューを。ソフト面・ハード面ともに、発売後に色々ありました。どちらも現在改善されてはいるので、これから購入する方は、発売当初に比べれば良くなっています。ただ、広く一般に勧められる製品になったかというと、まだ、分かる人向けのスタートアップの製品という印象。後述。またレビューの最後に書いていますが、wena3も発売されて2年経ち、次の展開の話も以前出ていました。実際、次機種が出るのかどうかわかりませんが、急がないのであればwena3の次の展開を待っても良い時期とも思います。wena3のヘルプ関連は、公式サイトでWeb公開されています。(「wena3 サポート」で検索)購入された方には特に、「よくあるご質問」(FAQ)のページに役立つ情報が色々あるので、確認をお勧めします。■■■ 事前に知ってた方が良い、wena3の電子マネー関連情報ヘルプの情報も踏まえつつ、つまづきそうな注意事項・細かな情報や、納得しづらい仕様の理由について。＜Suica＞wena3のSuicaは、Android・iOSどちらでもwena3アプリから発行・チャージできます。おサイフ機能(FeliCa)の無いスマホでも可。スマホでのチャージはGooglePayのみ。Suica発行直後はチャージ上限5000円ですが、2週間ほど経つと上限2万円になります。注意点は、利用しているSuicaプラットフォーム側の仕様により、既存のSuica引継・定期券利用・オートチャージ等ができない制限があることです。現在対応してる機能は、「wena3 Suica」で検索して出てくる公式ページの一番下にある一覧で確認を。(Suicaプラットフォームについては、ImpressWatchのWeb記事『ソニーのスマートウォッチ「wena」が目指す時計の自由。Suicaとアナログの価値』等を参照)そのオープンなSuicaプラットフォームができたお陰で、最近は色々なメーカーがウェアラブル機器等でSuica対応できるようになりました。ですが、モバイルSuicaやApplePay版Suicaに比べると、まだ制限があるようです。GarminやFitbitのSuicaにも、wena3と全く同じ制限がありますが、おそらく同じSuicaプラットフォームを利用しているからでしょう。なのでこの制限は、wena側の問題というよりSuicaプラットフォーム側の問題と思うので、そちらの改善を待つしかありません。実際あった改善例として、最初できなかったエクスプレス予約が、2021/03/06からできるように後から変わりました。モバイルSuicaは(PixelWatch除いて)ウェアラブル向けではありませんし、ApplePay版Suica(AppleWatch含む)のような専用サービスをJR東日本と構築できるのはAppleのような超大手だけでしょう。wena3の電子マネーでは、Suicaが一番、登録やチャージが簡単です。Riiiver機能で、残高が指定金額以下になったらスマホに通知を出せるようにもなりました。ちょっとした買い物でSuica利用するくらいが丁度よい使い方かもしれません。＜楽天Edy・iD・QUICPay (Suica以外の電子マネー) 全般の話＞最初に書きましたが、wena3に楽天Edy・iD・QUICPayを登録するのに使う、FeliCa Networks社の「おサイフリンク」サービスが、2023年12月31日で終了すると発表されました。(iDのみ2023年4月下旬に先行終了)つまりサービス終了後に、wena3を新規購入、または修理で新品交換になった場合や、iD・QUICPayに紐づくクレカの有効期限が切れて更新した場合等は、もう楽天Edy・iD・QUICPayをwena3に登録して使うことはできないということです。ただし終了前にwena3に「おサイフリンク」で初期登録済ませていれば、終了後の2024年以降も、wena3の楽天Edy・iD・QUICPayで支払い・チャージは可能です。詳しくは「wena3 おサイフリンクのサービスの終了について」で検索して出てくる、wena公式ページのアナウンスを参照。ただ後述のように「おサイフリンク」で対応しているiD・QUICPayは、昔のおサイフケータイ向けの古いタイプなので、対応カードも少なくなっています。更にiD・QUICPayは、紐づくクレカの有効期限で使えなくなります。そのため、これからiD・QUICPay目的でwena3購入するのは、お勧めできません。楽天Edyは有効期限もなく、楽天Edyアプリでチャージもできるので、2023年中なら楽天Edy目的で購入するのはアリかもしれません。(wena3が故障したらそれまでですが)ウェアラブルで楽天Edyに対応しているのは、今もwenaシリーズだけですので。元々この「おサイフリンク」は、ApplePayが出る前のiPhone向けに発売された「おサイフケータイジャケット」へ電子マネーを登録するためのもの。なのでAndroid用のアプリは無く。その後、iPhone自体がApplePay対応したため、おサイフジャケットの意味は無くなり、現在は、このサービスに後から乗っかったwenaシリーズだけが使う状況だったのでしょう。サービス内容も古いままでしたので、FeliCa Networks社がサービス終了するのも仕方がないところ。これはwena3発売当時の話ですが、wena3開発者のインタビュー記事によれば、Suica対応だけにしてシンプルにする案もあったけれど、「おサイフリンク」の電子マネーを外すと前機種から機能ダウンになるので、あえて残されたとのこと。元々そういう位置づけだったようです。Suicaに加えて更に新たな仕組みを導入するのはコストも時間もかかるでしょうから、前機種と同じくこの古いサービスをwena3でも採用したのは理解できます。ただ、できれば「おサイフリンク」サービス終了発表前に、wenaシリーズで新たな決済手段拡充するようなニュースがあると良かったなと思います。上記を前提の上で、wena3に「おサイフリンク」で登録する主要な電子マネーについて、個別の注意事項を以下に。＜楽天Edy＞おサイフリンクで登録する楽天Edyは、オートチャージ設定ができません。初期登録が済めば、iOS端末でも、おサイフ(FeliCa)対応のAndroidでも、おサイフ非対応のNFC付きAndroidでも、楽天Edyアプリでチャージできます。ただし、おサイフ非対応のNFC付きAndroidの場合、楽天未検証な端末だとEdyアプリ起動できない場合があるそうです。その場合はコンビニでチャージでしょうか。Androidで検証された利用可能端末は、「楽天Edyアプリ ご利用可能端末について」で検索して出てくる楽天Edyのページで確認できます。故障盗難時の残高移行のためには、楽天ポイントと紐付けして楽天でマイページ登録が必要です。なので特にAndroidの人は、iOS端末の「おサイフリンク」アプリで初期登録する際、楽天ポイントを貯める設定にするのを、必ず忘れないよう。その手順は、wena3アプリの「Payment設定」→「楽天Edy」→「楽天Edyマイページの登録について」から確認できます。ただし、iOS端末にペアリングしておサイフリンク設定している間は、Android端末側のwena3アプリは起動NGです。設定作業中はブラウザで「wena wrist・おサイフケータイジャケット故障/盗難/紛失時の残高移行について」で検索すれば、同じ楽天Edyのページが出てきます。＜iD＞おサイフリンクで登録できるiDは、ポストペイ型iDのクレカで、かつ、おサイフケータイ版iDに対応してるものだけです。カード型iD・ApplePay版iD・GooglePay版iDは、おサイフリンクが対応していないので登録できません。ややこしいですが、電子マネー「iD」公式ホームページの「対応カード一覧」を見れば、上記踏まえて対応しているクレカはどれなのか確認できます。勿論、iOSのおサイフリンクアプリで、iD登録時に表示されるクレカ一覧で確認するのが確実です。ただし、上記情報で対象になっているクレカでも、新規受付終了している場合もあります。具体例として、三井住友のiDには、おサイフリンクで登録できる「三井住友カードiD(携帯)」(要はおサイフケータイ版)がありますが、2022/01/28に新規受付が終了。また同じ会社のクレカでも、提携カードによっておサイフケータイ版iD非対応ということもありえます。これも三井住友の過去例ですが、提携カードであるAmazonカードは元々「三井住友カードiD(携帯)」非対応だったので、おサイフリンクのiD登録には使えませんでした。おサイフケータイ版iDは古いタイプなので対応カードは減っており、今後スマホ向けはApplePay版iD・GooglePay版iDがメインになるのではと思います。また、dカードのiDは、dカードに登録した電話番号のdocomo回線が必要なので、docomo以外の人は他のカードを。wena3アプリの「ヘルプ」→「サポート」→「よくあるご質問」→「電子マネー」配下の「iDの設定に関して注意事項はありますか？～」にも、iD関連の情報があるので、ご確認を。＜QUICPay＞おサイフリンクで登録できるQUICPayは、現在スマホで主流のQUICPay+(ApplePayやGooglePayで利用するQUICPay)ではなく、QUICPayモバイル(おサイフケータイ向け)です。QUICPayの本家であるJCBは、2021年3月でJCBカードでのQUICPayモバイル利用を終了しました。他のカード会社のQUICPayモバイルが、いつまで使えるのかは不明ですが、QUICPayモバイルは先細りで、最終的にQUICPayはカード型とQUICPay+が残る気がします。現在QUICPayモバイルに対応しているカード会社は、「QUICPayモバイル ポータルサイト」で検索して出てくる「QUICPay カード会社一覧」ページで確認できます。(iOSのおサイフリンクアプリで表示されるページと同じ)かなり少なくなりましたし、今後も更に終了するカード会社が出てくると思います。＜電子マネー関連 総括と将来的な話＞以上、wena3の電子マネーには制限や注意点が色々ありますが、その原因はwena3側というより、Suicaプラットフォームの仕様だったり、FeliCa Networksのおサイフリンクサービスの問題や、iDやQUICPayがおサイフケータイ版からGooglePay版/ApplePay版に移行しつつあること等々にあります。そういう情報を知っていた方が、納得(諦め)しやすいのではと。最初登録するまでが手間ですが、登録してしまえば、使う時はwena3側の操作不要で複数種類の電子マネー決済できるので、お手軽な決済端末として優れていると思います。将来的な話について。まず今回追加されたwena3のSuicaシステムは、モバイルFeliCaプラットフォームがウェアラブル端末にも拡張されたことと、そのプラットフォームへの接続にTISのデジタルウォレットサービスを利用することで実装できたそうです。「wena3 Suica TIS」で検索すると、関連したインタビューや導入事例が出てきます。ここからが本題ですが、それらを読むと今後の展開として、TISと「Suica以外の他の決済サービスへの対応も、互いに協議しながら進めていく」という話が出てました。次期モデル以降の話かもしれませんし、実際どうなるのか何もわかりません。またこれは2021年4月～7月頃に出ていた話題です。これを書いてる時点でもう1年半経ちますが、その後の情報を私は見たことがないので、現状どうなのかわかりません。ですが、将来wenaシリーズの対応決済サービスが広がる可能性があるというこれらの情報は、おサイフリンクの終了が発表された今、特に意味があると思います。またこのレビューの最後の方で書いてますが、wena3の次機種？について以前話は出ていたので、合わせて期待したいです。■■■ Androidユーザーが、iOS端末で楽天Edy・iD・QUICPayを登録する手順についてwena3に楽天Edy・iD・QUICPay等を初期登録する「おサイフリンク」アプリは、iOS端末用しかありません。ですが、wena3に登録した電子マネー情報はiOS端末内に残らないので、Androidユーザーの場合でも、友達や家族のiOS端末を1回使わせてもらい初期登録しても全く問題ありません。初期登録を済ませてAndroidにペアリングし直せば、その後、wena3で楽天Edy・iD・QUICPay利用するのにiOS端末は不要です。また初期登録で使うiOS端末は、ApplePay対応してる必要はなく、Bluetoothが使えてネット接続(WiFiでも可)できれば古くてもOK。私は、手持ちの古い初代iPadAir(WiFiのみ。ApplePayなし)で初期登録しています。AndroidユーザーがiOS端末で初期登録する具体的手順には、他にも注意事項があります。まず、ヘルプガイドに「おサイフリンクアプリの利用開始前に、wena3アプリのチュートリアルからwena3の初期設定が完了している必要があります」とあります。なので先にAndroidで、wena3アプリをインストール・ペアリング・チュートリアルで初期設定までは済ませましょう。その上で、Suica以外の電子マネー登録する手順ページは、wena3アプリの「Payment設定」→「楽天Edy」または「iD/QUICPay」→「iOS端末での初期設定の仕方はこちら」から、確認できます。ですが手順を読むとわかりますが、iOS端末にペアリングし直しておサイフリンク設定作業している間は、Androidのwena3アプリは起動NGです。なので手順の確認はwena3アプリからではなく、ブラウザで「wena3 iOS端末をお持ちのAndroidユーザーの方へ」で検索すれば同じページがトップに出てくるので、設定作業中はそちらを参照。基本的には、そのページ手順に従うことが前提です。きちんと手順を踏めば、元のAndroid端末に戻った後も、wena3アプリ内に残っている過去の活動ログデータ等はそのまま使えます。その公式手順への補足ですが、手順の中でAndroid端末またはiOS端末でペアリング解除した後(現在の公式手順では、4の作業直後と、9の作業直後)は、すぐに解除した端末でBluetoothを一旦OFFにした方が良いです。そうすれば、wena3で別端末とペアリングする際の邪魔にならないので。後から適宜またONにするのを忘れないように。再ペアリングの手順内でwena3本体を初期化するせいか、最後にまたAndroid端末に戻った時、前にチャージしていたSuicaの残高が最初wena3本体で表示だけされません。(電子マネー設定自体は、wena3本体を初期化しても消えません)一度wena3アプリのPayment設定でSuicaを選択して確認すると、またwena3本体でも残高が再表示されるようになります。ここからは公式手順ではないので、参考程度＆自己責任で。以前は、ペアリング状態を解除するためには、wena3を初期化するしかありませんでした。公式手順もその当時の前提のままです。ですが2022/01/28のソフト更新で、wena3本体のsettingsメニューに「ペアリング削除」が追加されたので、wena3を初期化せずにペアリング先変更ができ、行き来がスムーズになります。具体的には、現在の公式手順の5と8でwena3を初期化するところを、ペアリング削除 に置き換えるだけです。あとは、公式手順10で元のAndroid端末で再ペアリングした後、Bluetooth設定画面のWNW-21A(wena3)の歯車アイコンをタップし、使用機能でOFFになっているものをONに(音楽コントロールやカメラシャッターで使う機能)してから、手順11のwena3アプリ起動すれば、wena3初期化していないので初期設定を促されることもなく、何もなかったかのようにそのまま継続して使えました。ただ、もし何か問題が起こってアプリ再インストールする羽目になると、GoogleFit/Appleヘルスケア連携してない過去の活動ログデータや、アプリ設定は消えてしまうので、この辺りは自己責任でお願いいたします。■■■ 時計ヘッドの選択基準について(メタルバンドの場合)wena3のメタルバンドは薄く、1つのコマが小さいです。ただしこれはwena3では意味あるのではと。次のバンド関連で後述。他の方も書かれてますが、肉厚バンド前提の高級時計ヘッドと合わせるとバランスが悪くなるので、シンプルなデザインの時計ヘッドの方が相性良いかもしれません。wena3側のメタルバンドを、自分で腕時計側のバンドに置き換える方もいらっしゃいますが、色々手間はかかるので悩ましいところ。時計本体と完全にマッチしたバンドとセットなwena3コラボモデルの意義は、そこにあります。2022/09/29時点ではCITIZENエコドライブのwena3搭載モデルがお安く、特にAT2497-54EとAT2498-51Eは大手量販店で4万切る値段で、お得感あります。更に、時計本体のバンドを極力活かすROLEX・OMEGA互換性モデルもあります。この形が一番wena3の趣旨に沿ってるなと。本当は、この互換性モデルの両端の短いピースとwena3本体が別々に販売され、ピースだけ色々変えられるのが理想と思いますが。参考ですが、レビュー添付画像の時計ヘッドは、wena3用に新規購入したもの。カシオのリニエージ LIW-M700D-1AJF。wena3のエンドピースは20mm。ソーラー・電波・防水で、お値段控えめなアナログという条件で探し、僅かな選択肢の中から選択。クロノグラフだけどスッキリした盤面で見やすく、フルメタル・サファイアガラス、値段の割に品があって、機能・デザイン両面でコスパ良くて気に入っています。ゴツくないデザインなのでwena3のメタルバンドと合わせても違和感ないですし、wena3と同じくメタル枠・黒(濃い灰色)背景・白文字なので、wena3を付けた時の統一感もあり。こんな感じで色合い合わせてヘッド選ぶのも、お手軽で良いと思います。■■■ その他バンド関連他の方も書かれてますが、メタルバンドでも、wena3の心拍センサー部分が安定して手首にあたるよう、キツくない範囲でピタッと位置が安定する長さにバンド調整した方がよいです。キツくても血流悪くなったり、かぶれが発生する原因にもなるとバンドガイドにも書かれているので、程々に。またバンドが緩すぎると、wena3から出る心拍センサーの光が隙間から漏れてしまう問題も。他のスマートウォッチのようにセンサーが時計ヘッドの裏だと隙間が開きづらいですが、wena3は手首の内側なので。肉厚なメタルバンドの腕時計をつける際、少し緩めにバンド調整することが多いですが、上記の理由から、wena3では同じようにしない方がよいです。私の勝手な推測ですが、この心拍センサー含めたバンド調整が難しいことが、wena3の活動ログ精度に影響しててもおかしくはないなと。wena3のメタルバンドが、薄くコマが小さいことには意味があると上で書きましたが、それはコマが小さい方が幅調整しやすいということで。またバンドが薄く全体的に軽いほうが、手首上の位置も安定しやすいです。wena3は手首を内側に捻って画面確認するので、wena3本体のバンド上の位置は、中央よりも少しだけ親指側に寄せたほうが見やすいかもしれません。手首の骨は外側の方が太いので自然とそうなるはず。(画像を参照。自分は左手首につけてます)こういった位置や長さ調整は、wena3では特に試行錯誤が必要になるかもしれないので、バンド調整は時計屋さん依存よりも、やはり自分でできる方がよいです。自分は安いバンド調整器具とピンセット買って、今回初めてバンド調整しましたが、wena3付属のバンドガイドと、「wena3 バンド調整」等で検索すれば説明記事も出てくるので、確認しながらやれば、割と簡単にできました。Cリングという小さな金属チューブがあるので、小皿の上とか、部品を見失いにくい状態で作業することを勧めます。自分で調整するのが不安・手間な方は、時計屋さんで調整する際に上記が参考になれば。活動ログを重視する方は、ラバーを選択した方が良いと思います。メタルバンドだと寝る時は外したい方多いでしょうし。レザーは汗をかくと臭いが・・なのでやはりラバー。他のレビューで、メタルバンドをwena3とセットにするならメタルバンドに伸縮性を持たせた方が・・という意見ありましたが、活動ログを考えるなら凄く同感です。■■■ wena3本体のメタル枠について画面の上下にあるメタル枠は、割と傷つきやすいです。多少の細かな傷がついても、もう気にしないのが良いです。画面だけでなく、少なくとも枠正面はタフにしてほしかったですが、この枠部分がBluetooth通信のアンテナを兼ねている特殊なものらしいので、強度改善のハードルは高いのかもしれません。余談ですが、現在この枠を保護するwena3専用カバーが、別メーカーから発売されています。(「wena3 保護カバー」で通販サイトを検索)買って試したところ、思ったよりは見た目は気にならないしアリかなと、しばらく使っていました。ただ、あくまで私の使用時ですが、カバーの着脱時やカバー内側とwena3メタル枠で微妙な接触があると、メタル枠に細かな傷が付くことがあるので、現在は使っていません。他に選択肢もありませんし、カバーつけっぱなしで問題ない方、気にならない方には、保護目的でアリな製品とは思います。■■■ その他Tips充電アダプターを外す時は、USB差込口と反対側の出っぱってる上部を押し上げるとアダプターがパカっと開くことに最初気づきにくいです。wena3未装着状態で試すとわかりやすいです。検索すれば、wena3について情報を書いているサイトや動画は色々あります。私のお勧めは「ソニーショップ テックスタッフ」さんのブログ。ソフト更新で機能追加等された時など、いつも丁寧な記事をすぐアップされてて、それが仕事とはいえ凄いなと常々。■■■ wena3 全体レビュー 良いところ＜良いと思うところ まとめ＞私は主に以下の理由で、現在もwena3を使い続けています。これらを全て満たせる製品は、今のところ他にはありません。・好きな腕時計ヘッドと合わせられる。wena3本体のデザインも良いので、腕時計として見た目も満足できること。・腕時計ヘッド側で時間は瞬時に確認でき、裏返せば人から見られにくい手首の内側でスマホ通知内容を確認できること。・大きな画面・文字で、中年の自分にも通知内容が見やすいこと。特に横長画面の方が文章は読みやすいので、そこが他のスマートウォッチには無い大きなメリット。・通知対象とするアプリに制限が無く、更に通知タイトルや本文の文言を条件にwena3へ通知させるかフィルタリングもできること。・電子マネーが単体で使えること。おサイフ機能のないSIMフリーAndroidを使っているので、自販機等でwena3で決済でき、特に楽天Edyが使えるのがありがたい。(ただし電子マネーは上述のように注意点色々)・AppleWatchやWearOSのような高機能さは無いが、その代わりにバッテリーが1週間以上持ち、充電が週末だけで済むので煩わしくないこと。＜以前は問題あったが、現在解決していること＞・GoogleFit/Appleヘルスケア連携、発売当初から対応予定とあるのに中々対応されなかった→2022/08/23のソフト更新で、ついに連携対応されました。StressやBodyEnergyといったwena3独自な項目は連携できませんが、基本的な項目は連携できます。また対応当初は、wena3アプリで固定値入れてるだけの身長・体重も連携対象になる問題がありましたが、2022/12/19にアプリ修正され、身長体重は連携除外されました。・急にwena3に通知が来なくなり同期できなくなることが、たまにあった→初期から発生していた問題で、人によって発生状況・頻度様々。BlueTooth接続は切れていないのに通知が来ない・同期できない状態。最近は通知だけ来ないケースもありました。私の環境では、ソフト更新重ねるうちに発生しなくなったりまた発生したりでしたが、最近は殆ど発生しなくなったので、とりあえず解決とします。もしこの現象が発生した場合は、wena3を再起動するか、それで駄目ならスマホ再起動すれば復旧します。・wena3アプリから手動で同期ととらないと、活動ログデータがwena3アプリに同期されなかった→2022/08/23のソフト更新で、バックグラウンド自動同期機能が追加。自動同期のタイミングは不期ですが、自分のAndroidスマホでは、早ければ30分に1回程度(遅い時もある)自動同期されます。・音楽コントロール機能がなかった→2022/01/28のソフト更新で追加。合わせてカメラのシャッター機能も追加(自撮り棒でよくある機能)。私の場合、普段イヤホンWF-1000XM4を使ってますが、タッチセンサーが使いづらいのと、再生制御とボリューム制御を同時に割当できないので、wena3のこの機能追加が意外に便利。機能の詳細は、カメラのシャッター機能追加含めてヘルプガイドやよくあるご質問(FAQ)に記載されているので、使える条件やうまく動かない時は確認を。・他のスマホにペアリングし直す場合、wena3の初期化が必須だった→2022/01/28のソフト更新でwena3本体のsettingsメニューに「ペアリング削除」が追加され、初期化せずにペアリング先の変更ができるようになりました。初期化するとwena3本体内の過去2週間の活動ログデータは消えますが、ペアリング削除なら消えないので、機種変時などに役立ちそうです。・充電中以外は、wena3単体でバッテリー残量を数値表示できなかった。→2021/01/12のソフト更新で、バッテリー残量表示機能が追加。wena3本体画面の右上バッテリーアイコン辺りタップで表示。ただ、初見では出し方がわかりづらいです。ヘルプガイドにもまだ未記載。・アプリ通知は10個の履歴が残り続ける仕様で、個別/まとめて削除することができなかった。→2021/11/30のソフト更新で、通知を個別または全てを手動削除する機能が追加。更にスマホ側で消した通知がwena3側でも消えるように(逆もあるがそれはiOSのみ)なったので、wena3の通知消化が非常に楽になりました。・電子マネー設定で、Android→iOS→Androidと再ペアリングして行き来する際、手持ちのiOS端末が中々wena3を認識せず、ペアリングできないことがあった。→現在、この症状は全くありません。特に2022/01/28のソフト更新でBluetoothプロファイルが変わったせいか、すぐ再ペアリングできるようになりました。＜その他の便利機能、細かな話＞・アプリ通知のフィルタリング例wena3の通知フィルタリングは、通知タイトルや本文にある文字を条件にして通知させるかさせないか切り分けもできる、他機種にも中々無い優秀な機能。例えば下記は、Androidで確認したフィルタリング例です。iOSでは未確認。下記例のLINEやTwitterの通知は、スマホ本体では一時的に出てすぐ消えるものなので、wena3側にも一旦通知は来るものの通知履歴からは自動で消えます。(2021/11/30のソフト更新で、スマホ本体側で消された通知がwena3側でも自動で消えるようになったため)ですが通知自体は一旦wena3に来てしまい、連続でwena3の通知バイブが鳴って煩わしいので、それを無くすためのフィルタです。例１．LINEで、「新着メッセージがあります。」の通知と本文記載の通知が連続して来ることがあるので、最初の「新着～」の通知が来ないようにする。→LINEの通知フィルタリング追加で、"" 本文 と 新着メッセージがあります。 が 完全一致する時 通知を しない ""と、フィルタリングを追加。例２．Twitterで、自分がツイート投稿する時の通知がwena3に来ないようにする。→Twitterの通知フィルタリング追加で、"" タイトル と ツイートを送信しました が 完全一致する時 通知を しない ""と、フィルタリングを追加。\u3000更に、"" タイトル と ツイートを送信中 が 完全一致する時 通知を しない ""というフィルタリングも追加。・Alexa機能wena3のAlexaは、ちょっとした調べ物以外でも、echo端末や対応家電を使っていなくても、結構便利に使えます。例えば、wena3から音声でAlexaのリストにメモしたりGoogleカレンダーに予定登録もでき、短い内容ならwena3で後から表示もできます。つまり、文字入力できないwena3でも、Alexa使えばちょっとした覚書きメモもできる訳で、活用次第で実用的な機能。また、wena3純正のアラーム機能はスマホアプリからしか登録できませんが、2021/02/26に追加対応されたAlexaのアラーム・リマインダーなら、wena3から音声だけで登録・解除できます。wena3でのAlexa利用は、誰でも実感しやすい活用法がもっとあると思うので、あまりPRされていないのが勿体ないなと。・Riiiver機能Riiiver機能は、IFTTTに少し似た感じでトリガー・サービス・アクションを組み合わせて機能を実現する、CITIZENのIoTプラットフォーム。wena3のRiiiver、使える用途は実質まだ少ないですが、wena3のボタン一発でLINEで定型文送信できるPieceが後から追加されたり、今後Pieceが少しずつでも増えて便利な新しい使い方が出てくる可能性あるなら、期待込みで良いなと個人的には思います。wena3がトリガーになるので、起点で使い方を2つに分けると、(wena3の画面やボタン操作をトリガーにする)要は、wena3からの一発操作で完結すること、結果確認もwena3で表示できる範囲のことに使える可能性。現在対応されているのは、スマートロックやIoT家電の操作、LINEやGmailで定型文の一発送信、Webサービスから特定の情報を取得して表示する系、IFTTTとの連携など。こちらがRiiiver機能活用のメインだと思うので、今後の展開に期待しています。例えば、、スマホ本体の通知以外の汎用的な情報(スマホ本体のバッテリー残量、マナーモード状態(音量)、接続回線状況など。できればカスタマイズ可)を、ボタン一発でwena3に表示できるPieceがあると便利かも？ スマホ本体のバッテリー残量表示はスマートウォッチでよくある機能ですし、映画観る時とかスマホ出さずにマナーモード状態確認できるのも便利かもですし。そんな妄想の余地があること自体が良いなと。(wena3でしか持っていない情報の変化をトリガーにする)現在は対応されているのは、電子マネー(Suica,楽天Edy)の残高アラートだけ。他に考えられるのは、wena3の活動ログをトリガーにするくらいですが、リアルタイムで変動する活動ログをトリガーにするのはバッテリー消費面で微妙かもしれません。■■■ wena3 全体レビュー イマイチなところ＜活動ログ関係＞・活動ログの測定内容・精度wena3の活動ログは、おそらく心拍数・歩数計測をベースとして、睡眠・カロリー・VO2Max・ストレス等を推定で算出する、日常生活メインのログ機能です。これは用途が違うだけの話ですが、特定の運動を検知するようなフィットネス特化の機能は無いので、フィットネス重視の方にはお勧めできません。また特に発売当初は、ソフトの不具合もあり、内容の精度が不安定でした。この1年で徐々に改善されていますし、私の場合は、BodyEnergyはさておき、それ以外は現在それなりに計測されてるように見えます。ですが人によって様々あるようです。「ヘルプ」→「サポート」→「よくあるご質問」→「活動ログ」に、正しく測定できないケースの情報がいくつかあるので、ここは目を通した方がよいです。私個人は、活動ログはオマケ程度に考えているので、正直それほど気にしてません。＜通知ポップアップ等が、長時間画面を占有し続けること＞2021/03/24のソフト更新で、最後の通知1件を前面表示する通知ポップアップ画面が、手動で消さない限り画面再点灯後も長時間前面表示され続ける仕様になりましたが、私は不便に感じます。通知されて間もない時なら、最後の通知がポップアップされていれば、wena3を操作しなくてもチラ見するだけで読めるので便利です。ですが、通知されてある程度の時間が経つと、最後の通知1件に特別な意味は無くなり複数溜まった通知の1件に過ぎなくなるので、逆にポップアップが邪魔になります。例えば後からwena3でまとめて通知を確認する場合、まず最後の通知1件だけの通知ポップアップを見て、結局ホーム画面から改めてその他通知履歴を確認することになるので、二度手間に。更に、通知ポップアップは通知履歴と違って通知時間が右上に出ないので、いつ来たかわからない古い通知が表示され続けることにも。(通知ポップアップも通知時間を出した方がよいのでは)また、パッとwena3を見たときに操作可能/目に入れたい機能・情報が配置されているはずのホーム画面を、通知ポップアップが長時間潰してしまいます。現在は、寝起きにwena3見ると、何時間か前に通知あってもホーム画面になってる？ことが多いので、後から動きが変わってるかもしれませんが。ですが、起きてwena3利用している間の感覚では、ポップアップが残る時間が長すぎるなと。理由は以上ですが、人によってスタイルは違うので、例えば、指定した時間(数分～数時間)が経過した通知ポップアップ(それ以外の画面も)は、次回画面点灯時にすぐ自動で閉じてホーム画面を見せる、時間指定なければ従来どおり。そんなオプション指定がwena3アプリ・本体に追加されると、個人的には嬉しいです。＜ユーザーへの情報共有が不十分なこと＞wena3のヘルプやFAQは、ざっくりしてますが情報は有用ですし、細かすぎても読む気がなくなるので、シンプルな良さはあります。とはいえ、画面や操作で目に見える機能・設定については網羅してほしいですが、過去のソフト更新で追加された機能の一部が、まだヘルプガイドに記載されていません。具体的には、・2021/01/12更新で追加された、バッテリー残量画面の表示方法。(wena3の画面右上タップで表示されますが、情報無いと普通は気づきません)・2021/02/03更新で追加された、MAMORIO関係。(wena3アプリのMAMORIO設定自体が説明になってはいますが、ヘルプガイドに「MAMORIO」の単語すら記載がないのは、どうなんでしょう。FAQでも存在が触れられている程度で)・2021/02/26更新で追加された、Alexaのタイマー、アラーム、リマインダー機能の説明。(純正アラームが本体で登録解除できないwena3でこそ便利なのに勿体ないです)・2021/03/24更新で改善された、通知フィルタリング設定画面の説明。(そもそもヘルプガイドに通知設定自体の詳しい説明も無く一文あるのみ。わかる人には大体わかる設定ですが一番使われる設定ですし、一般向け製品のヘルプとしてどうなんでしょう)・2021/05/27更新で追加された、ディスプレイ表示時間設定の説明。2021/09/14のソフト更新以降は、ようやく同時にヘルプにも反映され(正直、当たり前ですが)、改善されたのは良かったです。そろそろ過去の更新についてもフォローを。。上記以外でも、例えばヘルプガイドの「機能を使う／設定する」→「メニュー/各種設定」には、現在あるメニューの全ては列挙されていません。他の項目やFAQで説明はありますが、ツギハギ感が。特にSuica以外の電子マネー設定の説明は、ヘルプガイドには細かなことは書かれておらず、FAQの電子マネーの項で色々書かれていますが(Suicaも電子マネーなので紛らわしいです)、系統立った説明が無いのでトータルで見て分かりづらいです。また、Androidユーザー向けのおサイフリンク手順「iOS端末をお持ちのAndroidユーザーの方へ」はwenaシリーズ全体で共有されていますが、途中途中のシリーズ毎のケース分けで読みづらいです。wena3用に新たなページを起こすなり、シリーズごとに説明全体を分けたほうがよいのでは。この辺りをわかりやすく丁寧にすることは、古い仕組み(おサイフリンク)を利用し続ける上で、特に必要なことではないでしょうか。ヘルプ以外についても、色々あります。wena3アプリに後から実装されたお知らせ機能について。wena3アプリ上に通知が表示されますが、一度内容表示したら、後から再確認することができません。シンプルにお知らせ通知もWeb公開して、後から確認できるようwena3アプリのメニューに追加するか、サポートページのトップにリンク乗せた方が良いのでは。本体/アプリのソフト更新時の情報について。サポートページの、本体/アプリのアップデート情報ページは、記述が簡素すぎて、どういう更新なのか意味不明なことが多いです。公式「wena news」サイトは、ある程度の内容紹介されているので、バージョンアップ時にはそちらへ誘導する通知等をwena3アプリから出すとか、wena3アプリのメニューにwena newsサイトを追加してもよいような。ただ「wena news」も最近は情報が簡素気味。。障害や不具合時の情報共有について。最近の例ですが、2022/06/15の日中、公式Webサイトにつながらず、同期やSuicaチャージもできない障害が発生しました。公式Twitterアカウントでのみ障害発生時と順次復旧中のアナウンスだけありましたが、その後も公式Webサイトには何の告知もなく、障害報告も結局出ませんでした。細かな話について報告不要とは思いますが、チャージできずに困ったユーザーもいたはずです。wena3アプリから公式Twitterを直接表示できない以上、公式Twitterからだけのアナウンスでは、ユーザーへの周知が明らかに不十分。wena3サポートページTOPに障害報告をきちんと出して、時間帯や経緯・復旧状況などの最低限の情報を共有して、ユーザーを安心させて欲しかったです。また、発売当初に不具合が多数発生していた頃。不具合の情報や対応状況が公式サイト側でまとまっていないため、各ユーザーは断片的な情報しかないまま、各々で困ったり非難したりという状況でした。2021/01/10の開発者トークショーで指摘を受けてようやく、不具合対応状況のまとめページが作られました。それでユーザーも現状認識しやすくなったのでは。発売当初や開発者トークショーで対応予定と公言された、GoogleFit/Appleヘルスケア連携や音楽コントロール機能は、対応されるまで結構な時間がかかりました。時間がかかること自体は仕方ないですが、ソフト更新で実際公開されるまで、対応の現状や予定について全く情報共有が無かったため、本当に対応されるのかと、多くのユーザーは長い間疑心暗鬼になっていたと思います。以上、これらは全てつながっている問題と私は思います。つまり、共有すべき情報をきちんと共有していないことが、ユーザーを不安にさせ続けてきたのではないか、ということです。ニッチな製品ですから、ユーザー要望を全て聞く必要は全くないでしょうが、共有すべき情報の共有まで怠ると、ついて来てほしいコアなユーザーこそ、離れてしまうのでは。実際、離れてしまったのでは。私はこの現状から、wena開発側はまだスタートアップ気分でいるのかなという印象を持ちます。過去の不具合もその延長ではないでしょうか。＜安定性全般＞ハードウェア面では2021/11/18に、特定症状が出ている過去ロットの無償修理対応が発表されました。(詳しくは「wena3 無償修理」で検索)私は上記発表前に、おそらく浸水起因？で調子悪くなって2021年夏頃に修理に出して新品交換となり、交換後もまだ上記対象の過去ロットなので何とも言えません。ですが現在販売されているロットは、少なくとも浸水対策面で改善され、発売当初のロットより良くなっているはずです。ソフト面では、特に発売当初は色々な不具合があり不安定でした。2021年は、他サービスとの連携追加等の大きな機能追加があっても、既存機能については細かな不具合修正が大半で、機能改善/要望対応面で弱かったです。ですが、上記の無償修理対応が発表された後、2021年末頃から2022年のソフト更新でようやく、発売当初から要望が多かったと思われる改善や機能追加が出てきました。安定性も徐々に改善してきていますし、約束されていた大きな更新も一区切りついたと言ってよいと思います。＜次期モデルに期待したい細かなこと＞2022/03/23の、wena責任者 對馬さんへのインタビュー記事『最先端と成熟の共存。「wena」に流れるものづくりの思想。』(検索すれば出てきます)を読むと、wena3の次の展開について、色々匂わせがあります。wena3発売から2年。このインタビューから状況が変わっていなければ、現在は次期モデル開発がメインでしょう。今とは路線が違う製品になるのかもしれませんし、まだまだ先の話かもしれません。もしそれがwena3の延長線になるなら、以下のような改善は期待したいです。・wena3で表示できる最大文字数は41.5文字。最低限の内容確認には十分ですが、足りない時もあるので、次モデルでは今の倍くらい読めると嬉しい。・対応決済サービスの拡充。TISと検討されてたという拡充の話が現在どうなっているのかわかりませんが。まずはクレカでしょうか。・本体とバンドを完全に切り離して、入れ替えしやすい作りになれば。・wena3本体枠のような傷つき易い所は無くして欲しい。■■■ 最後にマトモに全部読まれた方は殆どいないと思いますが、超長文すいません。最近はあまり見れていませんが、更新時には色々なレビューやSNSの情報を参考にさせて頂いてます。ありがとうございます。あれこれ書きましたが、wena3は今も便利に使っている製品なので、1ユーザーとして応援しています。', '個人的には非常に好きです。買ってよかったと思ってます。タイトルにもあるように何を一番に求めるかでレビュー変わるように思います。私は・スマートなスマートウォッチが欲しかった(他メーカーのバンドに対するでかい時計盤に興味をそそられなかった・Suicaが使いたい・通知機能が欲しいがメインだったため、満足しています。Suicaも反応がかなり良いです。あまりピタッとくっつけなくても反応しました。通知についても、文字数が思ったより多く内容が把握できます。子どもが動画を見たりゲームで遊んだりしている間、スマートウォッチでしっかり確認できます。アナログの時計盤が付けられるのも良いと思いましたが、これだけで十分時計も見れるので全然無くてもアリと思いました。(秒針は見れなくていい派なので全然オッケーです他の方のレビューにもあるように体調管理系は正直おまけ程度かなと思ってます。歩数計のカウントは携帯の方が優秀ですし、脈拍とかもちょっとずつズレるように感じます。また薄いとは言え少し幅があるのでちょっと邪魔に感じるかもしれません。外側だったら問題ない厚さですが内側だと意外と色んな場面で当たったりと不便には思います。購入を考えている方、他のサイトのレビューにも書かれていますが、ラバー・レザー・メタルは慎重に選んだ方がいいです。ラバー：wena単体で使用する方、時計盤をお出かけ用と仕事用など使い分けている方はこれ。時計盤の付け外しがワンタッチでできます。レザー：wena単体で使用する方、時計盤を一つだけしか使用しない方はこれ。(時計盤を取り替えられますが、全て外さないといけないので大変です)メタル：アナログ盤を使用する方のみ。私はオシャレだし単体利用前提だったのでレザーを選択しましたが、今思えば防水機能を活かすならばラバーだったかなぁとも思います。生産終了になった今更なレビューですが、ご参考になれば幸いです。', '機械式時計好きにはほぼ一択の選択肢。普通のスマートウォッチのように多機能を望まなければ十分使えると思います。自分はメールやLINEの受信や電話の着信が確認できればいい程度なので問題無しです。逆に電子マネーや健康管理アプリなどに重きを置く人には全く向かないかと思われます。取り付けに関して特にこだわりがなければ、そのままの取り付けは難しくありませんが、好みの時計に合わせてとなると、ある程度加工が必要です。時計好きの方はそういう加工も好きな方が多いでしょうから苦にはならないかもしれませんが…', '自分がずっと愛用していたGショックに取り付けました。少し苦戦しましたがつけてしまえばなかなかいい感じです。今まで使っていたA社製に比べて、機能は限定しているけど自分が必要としているもの（通知、スケージュール確認、音楽操作、支払い等）は一通り入っていて、バッテリー保ちが断然いいというのが助かります。そんなに頻繁に操作するわけではないので、腕を上げた時にディスプレイが点灯する機能をオフにした結果、一週間使用でもまだ五割弱のバッテリーが残っています。しかし、これは愛用の時計が元々あるけどスマートウォッチ機能も試したいという人にはとてもいいのですが、そもそも腕時計を着ける人自体が減少してきている世の中と聞いているので、万人ウケはしなかったのか、すでにサポート終了のアナウンスが出ております。これからも使い続けられたらどれだけ良かったか、とても残念ですが、終了までは使い続けたいと思います', '高級感があり、携帯の連携も簡単に利用できます。', '心拍数が安静時80だとか睡眠時間のブレなど気になりました。おサイフケータイの設定にiPhoneが必要だったり、少し古めのスマホに対応していなかったりアップデート面で不満ですね。安いしバッテリーが長持ちするだけマシかな', '使いやすさは人それぞれですが、シンプル画面はわかりやすいです機能は使い切れてないですが…', 'いろいろな時計のバックルに使っている。あと二年で終了なのが惜しい！', '使い始めて約１週間ですが満足してます。特にスポーツしないし、通勤で毎日歩くこともなく アルバイトでたまに歩くくらいです。スマホだと家の中では持ち歩かないので一日で１００歩も歩かない表示になってるのですが、これだと買い物に出かける前に既に１００歩数えてくれてるのでちょっと嬉しい。電車にも乗らないので一番使いやすい楽天Edyの設定にしてるのですが、財布もスマホもバッグの中から探して出さないのはちょっと楽。朝 起きて着替える時にスマホまで走らないで 手元を見て今日の最高気温を見ると暑くなりそうか寒くなりそうなのか雨が降るのか分かるのもちょっと楽。睡眠時間とか熟睡してるとかストレス心拍数なんかも分かるのも安心。購入するまでは「それくらいの手間どうってことない」って思ってたけどあると便利。ただ設定が少し面倒でした。Suicaはどうなのか分からないのですが、楽天Edyの設定をする時に自分のスマホはAndroidなのですが一番始めにiosのアプリを使わないといけなくて、iPadのアプリからスマホに移してwenaで使えるようにしました。充電は一週間もたせようと思えば通知をするアプリを減らすのが良さそうです。メール、カレンダー等選択出来ます。初めてのスマートウォッチなので他のと比べられないのですが、自分の生活には合ってると思います。', '使用し始めて半年。お気に入りの旧来の腕時計をあきらめてスマートウォッチを別につけなければいけないなんてことに悩まずに旧来のお気に入りの腕時計のヘッドを生かして、各種カウンター機能ややスマホ連動の通知機能を有することができる唯一無二のものだと思います。せっかくの有機ELディスプレイなのに、白黒のみの表現が残念ですが、その分バッテリーの持ちは2週間以上で満足。耐久性は腕の内側になるので、金属部分はどうしても傷がつきやすいです。ガラス面は強化ガラスなので、デスクワークであれば今のところカバーなしでも傷なしで使えています。']"

Pondré lo que considero como pros y contras y luego una valoración general.Pros:*Poco peso, apenas se nota en la muñeca.*Incluye un accesorio para montarlo en la bici que puede ser bastante útil.*La localización GPS es muy precisa, aunque aveces le cuesta un poco coger la señal.*El detector de pulsaciones funciona muy bien, eso si, hay que tener la correa bien ajustada.*Tiene un buen seguimiento del entrenamiento que estás realizando.*Muchos niveles de ajuste de la correa, es difícil que te quede mal.Contras:*Dice ser ""robusto"" y no lo es tanto, la pantalla se arañó con un pequeño roce con una pared, cosa que no debería pasar con un reloj pensado para deportes donde puede sufrir golpes y demás.*El sistema de notificaciones es bastante pobre por no decir malo. Te avisa, si, pero el sistema no funciona bien (lo explicaré más adelante).*La sincronización con el software del ordenador falla, tardé unos 3 días en poder actualizar el firmware del reloj porque no había manera (y no paraba de notificarmelo).*La batería dura poco comparada con otros dispositivos, por el precio que tiene deberían haber incluido una batería un poco mas grande.Vale, sabiendo los pros y contras (a mi parecer) comentaré mi experiencia con el reloj durante el mes que lo he estado utilizando. Lo primero es decir que lo he utilizado principalmente para ir andando y en bici, por lo que me voy a centrar en eso.El podómetro funciona bien, como en casi cualquier móvil moderno. En el modo de entrenamiento para bicicleta no tengo ninguna queja, la velocidad es precisa, la distancia, las pulsaciones, etc. Cuando detecta que estás parado pausa el entrenamiento y cuando arrancas otra vez lo reanuda. Los entrenamientos se almacenan en la memoria interna del reloj y los puedes sincronizar con el software del ordenador para ver los resultados mucho mejor. En el software puedes ver el recorrido en el mapa, estadísticas de velocidad, altura, etc. En general como reloj deportivo funciona genial, pero las funciones de ""smartwatch"" dejan mucho que desear.El sistema de notificaciones es bastante malo. Cuando lo sincronizas con el móvil por bluetooth te avisa de las notificaciones que vas recibiendo pero de forma muy desordenada. A veces parece que pierde la conexión y te llegan 10 notificaciones de golpe y para eliminarlas todas tienes que presionar ""ok"" 10 veces para poder ver la pantalla del reloj otra vez, imaginen esto con 50 0 60 notificaciones... No es funcional.Lo que a mi parecer funciona peor son las llamadas. Cuando te llaman comienza a vibrar y a parpadear la luz de notificación para avisarte de la llamada, bien, el problema es que no para hasta que le das ""ok"", incluso aunque ya hayas finalizado la llamada el sigue avisándote y es bastante molesto.  Esto es exactamente igual cuando eres tú el que llama, el reloj comienza a vibrar para avisarte que estás llamando a alguien y no para hasta que lo toques aunque ya haya finalizado la llamada, aunque hayan pasado ya 10 minutos. No lo sé, pero creo que en un reloj de este precio el sistema de notificaciones podría estar mejor implementado.Esto último pensé que podía ser un error del fimware ya que me avisaba que había una nueva versión. Actualizarlo me costó lo suyo porque el software para el ordenador me decía que no había conexión cuando si había. Envié correos y no obtuve respuesta, así que tuve que estar pendiente de la página de Sigma a ver si actualizaban el software y se solucionaba el error y así fue, lanzaron una nueva versión, la instalé y ahí si que me dejó actualizar el firmware del reloj. Aún así, en la última versión del firmware (1.67) sigue estando el problema de las notificaciones de llamadas.Para terminar, la batería puede llegar a durar un par de días o incluso menos, dependiendo del uso que le des, si lo tienes sincronizado con el móvil, la duración del entrenamiento, etc. Considero que es algo escasa, podrían haber puesto una batería mas generosa.Resumiendo:Es un buen reloj deportivo? Sí.Funciona bien como smartwatch? No.Recomiendo su compra? Considero que en relación calidad/precio hay mejores opciones en el mercado, por lo que yo miraría primero otras opciones.', 'Premetto che l\'ho acquistato perchè era in offerta a 49 euro e volevo utilizzarlo per la navigazione con le mappe (trekking cicloturismo ecc) dell\'applicazione komoot.Esistono due tipi di navigazione:1 - Navigazione tramite app con collegamento buethooth: questa funzione ti fornisce indicazioni grossolane con i metri restanti e la freccia che ti indica la prossima direzione. Purtroppo questa cosa ha delle pecche perchè se ti indica di svoltare in un sentiero dove vi sono più scelte di percorso nella stessa direzione, ti costringe a tirare fuori il telefono e controllare la direzione esatta, vanificando l\'utilità dell\'avere le indicazioni sul polso. Un\'altra cosa fastidiosa di questa modalità è che ti appare la notifica che non puoi rimuovere, se clicchi su ok ricompare istantaneamente.Una cosa positiva è che le notifiche sono accompagnate da una vibrazione.2 - Navigazione tramite il gps dell\'orologio: per utilizzare questa funzione bisogna salvare le mappe dall\'app komoot e poi entrare nell\'app proprietaria dell\'orologio e tramite bluethooth trasferirle sull\'orologio. Questo tipo di navigazione è più utile perchè ti mostra il percorso direttamente sull\'orologio tenendo anche traccia del tuo tragitto tracciando ""un\'ombra"" del tragitto che hai percorso in modo da riuscire anche a capire la direzione dalla quale sei venuto e se sei fuori traccia. Anche questa modalità ha dei problemi però, ogni tanto perde l\'orientamento e lo schermo ha un leggero tempo di refresh dove non vedi nulla e poi ricompare la posizione; questa cosa a volte ti disorienta, soprattutto perchè non è possibile ridurre lo zoom della mappa per capire dove sei in quel momento, dunque se ti trovi spaesato anche dal fatto che il percorso può non essere segnalato, ti costringe anche quà a tirare fuori il telefono aprire l\'app e caricare il percorso per capire la posizione ecc.Un problema riscontrato nel caricare una mappa è che non mi visualizzava il persorso e non c\'è stato verso di farlo andare, non so se questo è un bug di questa mappa nello specifico, un problema con l\'orologio o l\'applicazione.L\'app Proprietaria sigma link è abbastanza ricca di dettagli per il mio utilizzo, ci sono il calcolo delle calorie bruciate, i battiti cardiaci, le statistiche sui percorsi, i passi ecc.Il contapassi, non avendone mai usato uno, questo non è proprio fedele, anche se sono in macchina mi conta passi mai fatti o magari da seduto se picchietto un pò le gambe, non è molto affidabile.Anche il contatore dei battiti mi sembra un pò approssimativo ma queste cose non sono quello per cui ho acquistato l\'orologio.Per il prezzo a cui l\'ho preso, se si ha voglia di fare gli smanettoni può essere un buon compromesso, il software è un pò acerbo con funzioni dai risultati troppo approssimativi; è anche vero che per orologi con la funzione navigatore si passa sulla fascia dei 300euro; bisogna valutare l\'uso che se ne fa, di certo per il mio uso non lo ricomprerei a prezzo pieno.', '(1) misurazione battiti ok solo se siete fermi imprecisa ed inutilizzabile durante lo sport, ma avrete lo stesso problema con qualsiasi smartwatch a lettura ottica (ne ho provati diversi), ottimo con fascia Sigma, ma si aggancia a qualsiasi fascia/brand.(2) leggerissimo(3) BAtteria: lunga durata batteria (con lettore ottico spento, tanto non va e lo uso solo per lo sport.(4) GPS molto preciso, un po lento nell\'aggancio(5) APp/Software: ottimo software  per computer: (odio le app sul cellulare e dovermelo portare dietro) non siete costretti a dare la vostra vita ""gratis"" in mano al produttore, funziona senza necessità di essere collegato ad una app sul telefono, molti sport disponibili, software intuitivo, semplice, permette di stampare report sui training effettuati e di fare export dati su excel e su varie app (che non uso), permette anche mappatura percorso su mappa di default (non vi servono app aggiuntive).(6) Caratteristica unica: led colorato impostabile blue, rosso, verde che lampeggia indicando la zona di frequenza battiti al minuto (impostabile sul computer, credo anche dall\'app sul tel ma non l\'ho nemmeno scaricata).--> Overall Ottimo (pagato 49E + 29E di fascia...), 4 stelle per il fatto che il led colorato è poco visibile di giorno e la lettura ottica di battiti è inutilizzabile durante lo sport (come con tutti gli smart watch che ho provato, quindi non lo penalizzo più di tanto)', 'Montre polyvalente dont le prix est contenu.Manque cependant une notice complète en Français.Merci !!', ""Sigma Sports è una società  specializzata nella vendita di biciclette e attrezzature per il triathlon.Questo sport smartwatch che ho regalato a mio figlio non è male ma è un po' ingegnoso da utilizzare.Non è semplice e intuitivo come gli smartwatch a cui si è abituati.Il peso molto contenuto e la durata della batteria si apprezzano molto, come il GPS che risulta essere preciso una volta che si riesce ad agganciare il segnale... piccola pecca la sua lentezza."", 'Die ID.FREE wäre sicherlich eine sehr schöne Sportuhr mit ihren über die Sigma-eigene Software „Data Center“ individualisierbaren Bildschirmen, ihrem GPS und barometrischen Höhenmesser, ihrer Anbindung an „Komoot“ und „Geocaching“ und noch einigen anderen ähnlichen Anbietern, wenn nicht…die erste mir gelieferte Uhr bei der Richtungsanzeige („Heading“) über GPS Ost mit West (natürlich auch umgekehrt) verwechselt hätte. Interessanterweise zeigte der Kompass in die richtige Richtung, weshalb ich einen „simplen“ Fehler in der Firmware vermute, die anscheinend die vom GPS gelieferten Daten nicht korrekt interpretierte. Nachdem die Hilfestellung des Sigma-Kundenservice keine Verbesserung brachte, ging diese Uhr sofort zurück.In dieser Hinsicht ein dickes Lob an amazon, die mir noch am Tag der Rücksendung den vollen Kaufpreis auf das ursprüngliche Konto erstatteten.Da ich der ID.FREE noch eine Chance geben wollte, bestellte ich ersatzweise eine zweite.Bei dieser wurde nicht nur erneut Ost mit West für die Richtungsanzeige verwechselt (generischer Firmware-Fehler?), zusätzlich stimmte die Angabe der Höhe um teilweise mehr als 100 m nicht (abhängig vom Tagesluftdruck), denn die Uhr reagierte überhaupt nicht auf die Eingabe des Referenz-Höhenwertes, mit dem, wie bei einem barometrischen Höhenmesser nicht anders möglich, „eigentlich“ eine Eichung auf die tatsächliche Ausgangshöhe erfolgen soll. Dass bei dieser Uhr nicht, wie bei anderen ähnlichen Uhren, ein automatischer Höhenabgleich über das GPS erfolgt, hätte ich sehr leicht verschmerzen können, hätte es nur funktioniert.Leider weigerte sich der Sigma-Kundendienst vorab, mir die mir für eine Garantie-Einsendung notwendigen Versandkosten zu erstatten, da dafür „der Vertragspartner“ (Händler) zuständig sei.Zunächst kann ich diese Haltung sehr gut nachvollziehen. Nur kann der Händler immer nur das ausliefern, was er vom Hersteller erhält, und wenn ich zweimal defekte Produkte bekomme, bin ich der Ansicht, dass der Hersteller voll und ganz in der Pflicht ist, mir eine kostenlose Garantiereparatur so zu ermöglichen, dass das Produkt danach einwandfrei funktioniert.Insofern ist diese Haltung von Sigma meiner Ansicht nach weder kundenfreundlich, noch auch nur kulant.Schade um ein, wie gesagt, „eigentlich“ sehr schönes Produkt, das jetzt auch an „den Vertragspartner“ zurück geht.Inzwischen habe ich mir das „Flaggschiff“ der Smart- und Sport Watches erstanden und bin, wie von der Marke mit dem angebissenen Obst nicht anders gewohnt, hoch zufrieden.', 'Ich habe die Uhr gekauft um zusammen mit dem Radsport Equipment im Sigma Ökosystem zu bleiben.Davor habe ich eine Samsung Fit Gear Fit 2 war jedoch weder mit den Freien Apps noch mit Samsung Health für die Datenhaltung besonders glücklich.Das macht Sigma und die ID.Free besser:Pro:- Akku Laufzeit (einmal pro Woche laden reicht mir im Gegensatz zur Fit 2 die jeden Tag an den Stecker musste)- Dauerhaft lesbares Display auch ohne Beleuchtung- Als Fahrrad Tacho nutzbar (aber warum sollte man das tun?)- Gute - intuitive 4 Tasten Bedienung- Sigma Data Center kostenfrei für die Datenhaltung und Analyse- Bedienung gut auf Sporteinsatz angepasst- GPS aktiviert automatisch wenn ein Training gestartet wird und deaktiviert sich beim Beenden (spart Strom)- Ohne Cloudanbindung verwendbar (keine Datenkrake)- Automatischer Notruf bei Unfall ist eine gute Sache - Gerade wer als Rennradler oder im Gebirge alleine unterwegs ist- Alternativ mit Sigma Radsensoren verwendbar (gut z.B. beim Rollentrainer)Neutral:- Navigation habe ich noch nicht ausprobiert- Zeigt maximal 3 Größen auf einmal im Sportprofil an. Profile können zwar frei konfiguriert werden aber nur die angezeigten Werte und nicht das Layout- Design klobig. Sportgerät und kein Lifestyle Produkt.Contra:- GPS zickig. Braucht teils sogar outdoor mehrere Minuten bis genug Satteliten gefunden wurden und ohne ist die Geschwindigkeitsmessung schlechter als beim Gear Fit- Import der Trainingsdaten über USB auf PC funktioniert bei mir nicht. ID.Free wird für 30s am PC erkannt, disconnected sich dann aber und keine Daten werden importiert (sollte automatisch gehen im Gegensatz zu den Tachos bei denen man manuell Daten importiert und das zugehörige Profil auswählt. Ist nicht wirklich ein Problem da Import über Handy und BT problemlos geht (und sich bei Sigma Cloud Nutzung) auch direkt mit PC synchronisiert, aber nervig. (Dasselbe Problem hat auch der Rox 11)- Kein Nutzername hinterlegbar. Heißt beim Import werden die Daten immer als ""Default User"" importiert und jeder Datensatz muss manuell dem Profil zugewiesen werden. Ist zwar nur ein Klick aber nervig.- Für Indoorcycling auf Kardio statt Rollentrainer ungeeignet da nur der Puls aufgezeichnet wird und das Sigma Datacenter das manuelle Editieren von Logs verbietet. Manuelle Logs können zwar angelegt werden aber nicht mit den Pulsverläufen fusioniert werden. Unnötig und ärgerlich.Fazit: Für den Sport deutlich besser als die Gear Fit2 (im Angebot für den selben Preis) aber mit einigen nervigen Mankos. Wenn man aber ein nicht Werbefinanziertes Ökosystem bevorzugt sind die Alternativen überschaubar.', 'Die iD.Free war für mich einen Kauf wert, da man bei Sigma kein Online-Konto benötigt und auch nicht gezwungen wird, die Daten in die Cloud zu synchronisieren. Im Endeffekt ist das auch der Grund, dass ich die Uhr behalte.Vorteile:- Synchronisation und Auswertung auf dem lokalen PC ohne Zwangs-Konto in der Cloud (diese kann man aber auf Wunsch anbinden).- Sigma Data Center bietet alle Funktionen, die man zur Auswertung m.E. benötigt und man kann sowohl die Aktivitäten dieser Uhr als auch solche von anderen Sigma Geräten (bei mir Fahrrad-Tacho) kombiniert betrachten.- Die Uhr bietet verschieden Sportarten und außerdem das Tracking von Schritten solange man sie trägt.- Gute Akku-Laufzeit (habe es nicht genau verfolgt aber die Uhr hält bei mir schon mehrere Tage durch, natürlich abhängig von der Nutzung)- Das Gehäuse ist einfach (kein Schmuckstück) aber dafür wirkt es auf mich sehr robust. Das Armband kann man sehr einfach tauschen. Erfahrungsgemäß bietet Sigma lange Zeit Ersatzteile an, das Armband dürfte wohl das sein, was man hier am ehesten tauschen wird.Nachteile:- Genauigkeit beim Laufen ist ausbaufähig. Ich bin zunächst mal häufig wiederholt die gleiche Runde gelaufen. Diese geht bei mir durch den Wald und laut Routenplanung mit OpenStreetMaps ist sie 6,4 km lang und hat 180 Höhenmeter (jeweils runter und hoch). Die Uhr misst die Strecke mit 5,7 bis 6,8 km. Die Höhenmeter werden recht genau erfasst, wenn GPS aktiviert ist und ein Fix gefunden wurde. Wenn kein Fix besteht sind es immer 0 Höhenmeter in der Anzeige im Dashboard, in den Details werden die echt erfassten Höhenmeter angezeigt.- GPS-Fix manchmal geht es in 15-20 Sekunden und manchmal gar nicht, letzteres bei mir in etwa 50% der Fälle und unabhängig vom Wetter (also auch bei klarem Himmel). Ich habe auch schon gleichzeitig die SmartPhone App aktiviert und verbunden. Obwohl das SmartPhone eine aktivierte Standortbestimmung hatte, hat sich die Uhr einen Wolf gesucht und nichts gefunden. Es wäre irgendwie schön, wenn die Entwickler das ändern würden und den Fix vom Telefon übernehmen würden (aber ich glaube da passiert bei dieser Uhr nicht mehr viel).- Notifications, diese habe ich gleich abgeschaltet. Die Uhr ist ja im Vergleich zu den üblichen Smartwatches recht einfach und das Display recht klein, außerdem sehe ich eh keinen Mehrwert in einer Smartwatch und wollte dieses Gerät nur um beim Sport und bei Outdoor-Aktivitäten aufzeichnen zu können. Dazu frage ich mich in diesem Fall, was ich damit anfangen soll, da man eigentlich nur lesen kann.', 'Me ha gustado el precio y que va bien para la práctica del deporte.Mejorables las funciones smartwatch, batería y funcionalidades de la app Sigma Link.', 'Der größte Minuspunkt ist gleichzeitig der lahme GPS Fix, der durch nichts zu beheben war. Egal bei welchem Wetter oder welcher Umgebung, die Satellitenerkennung dauerte schlicht zu lange oder war erst gar nicht möglich. Damit ist eines der wichtigsten features der Uhr leider komplett unbrauchbar und nervt nur. Schade, denn Sigma hat gute Ansätze und als langjähriger Marktführer für Rad-Tachos hatte ich mehr von einem dt. Traditionsunternehmen erwartet. Das machen die Chinabomber von Amazfit etc. deutlich besser.']"

Has a standalone MP3 player, which seems very rare for a smartwatch in this price range based on my research.  4. It's water resistant. Based on my research, it's the only one in this price range that is water resistant and has a standalone mp3 player.Cons: 1. Capacity for loading media onto the device is actually only 2.04G. I know that some space is always taken up by native apps, etc, but  only 50% of the space advertised is pretty significant and completely misleading.  2. So far, battery life seems astonishingly poor. Instructions say to charge for 3 hrs before first use. I did this and left it on overnight, with the screen in sleep mode and bluetooth turned off. In the morning, the battery was half full.  3. Would be much more user friendly if the battery icon showed a percentage instead of a depleting cylinder.  4. Must be charged using a 3.5mm jack instead of the typical Android plug.  5. Screen isn't very responsive to the touch.
