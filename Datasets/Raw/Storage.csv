I recommend to check and update before writing data to it because of the well publicized problems with the SSD health degrading on the previous firmware version.', 'Decent upgrade compared to my previous Samsung 980 Pro. One the fastest Gen 4 drives.', 'Work with older PC with PLIe 3.0', 'It performed well in my new built system', 'I ordered this twice. The first time took so long I canceled because the price had fallen a lot before it was even shipped. The second time I ordered, Samsung took FOREVER to ship it. Then when it did ship, it arrived earlier than the expected date and I happened to be out of the house for that weekend but it was already returned to sender. Then the drive mysterious arrived again unexpectedly. Anyway, the drive came with defective firmware. You have to update it to prevent damage. And any damage done is not repairable. A firmware update only stops further damage. Worse, it turns out that Samsung doesn\'t support it\'s products ""sold internationally"" so despite buying from Amazon Singapore on Samsung storefront, the product has warranty according to Samsung. So basically if there\'s problems, Samsung will leave you out in the cold for this expensive drive. Try another one of the less expensive (and bettter) drives from a better company. Avoid greedy Samsung at all costs.', ""Make sure it's sold from Amazon and you are golden. No issue with firmware too. Local prices are marked up more than 40% as of writing.  With such cost. I would rather risk it without the local warranty. It is possible to claim the US warranty, you will be covering the shipping with more than enough change to do it couple of times. You need to figure your way out."", 'IF -- and that is a big ""IF"" you have to care for -- IF you have a computer with a PCIe Gen 4 x 4 interface, this drive will blow your socks off. It will FIT and will work in most any PCIe slot, but the incredible speed this drive is capable of shows up only when connected via a Gen 4 x 4 interface. If you indeed have that interface (verify it in your computer\'s specifications documentation or by tracking that information down any other number of ways) you won\'t find many drives out there that can beat it in sheer speed and performance. Files that used to move at rates you became accustomed to will now fly so fast as to make it almost appear comical. This is truly a fast drive that can revolutionize your computer: IF you have a PCIe Gen 4 x 4 interface to plug it into. If you don\'t, you\'re better off saving $40 0r $50 and getting the Samsung 980 drive which will max out your speed on a non-PCIe Gen 4 x 4 interface. The 980 is also a fine drive -- I have two or three of them that I use for all kinds of things -- but the 990 will blow right past the 980 with the proper interface. Near-instantaneous boots, program launches (even for things like Photoshop), etc. And if you have two of these Gen 4 x 4 interfaces and put two of these 990 drives in them, you\'ll see file transfer speeds that just boggle the mind. So, I give this my highest recommendation, but just make sure you have that interface or you\'ll be wasting your money, and should go with the 980 instead.']"

Mi anterior SSD de la marca Samsung con 4 años a sus espaldas apenas llegaba a los 500MB/s y este llega a los 4.000. Se nota en carga de Windows y Juegos (así como el caché de Windows) pero aún no se puede explotar su potencial porque no hay demasiadas apps, programas o juegos que usen la velocidad del 4.0.CONTRAS: Algo que no soy capaz de entender. Te gastas un dineral en una unidad de última generación que vale un buen dinero y te envían una caja de aluminio que parece de maquillaje y dentro SOLO un escueto manual y la unidad de memoria claro... pero ni rastro del tornillo para poder instalarlo... Que triste comprar algo así y no poderlo instalar por un simple tornillo minúsculo... ¿en serio? Es muy bizarro encontrarse en esa situación y no solo eso, es que una vez lo instalas... se calienta como un demonio y toca SI o SI ponerlo un disipador de calor si no quieres arriesgar y a la vez subir la temperatura de la placa base y la zona que queda muy cerca de la GPU y de la CPU. Sin duda un detalle importante que no tiene mucho sentido, es como comprar un móvil de los más caros y que no venga, ni cargador ni cable. Sin el cable no lo puedes conectar a ningún sitio, pero es que sin cargador te dura menos de 24 horas, pues aquí igual. El tornillo sería el cable y el cargador el disipador.']"

And boy, it is fast. Comparing it with Samsung 970 PRO 1TB SSD I bought back in 2018, the 980 PRO is faster until a certain sequential write workload of more than or equal to 558GB (specifically comparing the 980 PRO 2TB and the 970 PRO 1TB), then the 2 drives start trading blows with each other. 2TB is also just so much more capacious than 1TB. For writing and transferring large files, it is recommended to have a heatsink and some thermal pads to go along with it. I will update accordingly about the endurance over a period of time as I have already written 3.4TBW to the drive, since I got it 9 days ago as at time of writing it. I understand many are concerns about the NAND type switcheroo from MLC in the 970 PRO to TLC in the 980 PRO, and hence, that’s what reviews are for. Objectively pointing out whether it’s endurance is something worth crying over for, however, I don’t think that it’s a necessity to debate about MLC (hallmark of older Samsung PRO SSDs) vs TLC as the endurance is likely to be high enough for most consumer/client workloads.In the real world use, this SSD can be somewhat faster and make your system feel more responsive than the 970 PRO, but for light and casual use such as browsing the web, writing documents, editing small spreadsheets, the 2 SSDs won’t make a difference. Where this SSD make a difference however, is when you do memory and drive intensive workloads, such as batch exporting photos from Adobe Photoshop and/or Lightroom, importing videos from Adobe Premiere Pro, editing complex visual animation in Adobe After Effects, and/or virtual machines for coding or running your machine learning tasks. Not also forgetting memory swap, Adobe Creative Cloud and their suite of apps in Windows love consuming lots of memory, sometimes even consuming all 64GB of System RAM and having to do extra hundreds of GBs of memory swap. This SSD makes memory swapping a lot more efficient and responsive as to compared to my 970 PRO, thanks to the large pseudo-SLC caching being done. After the SLC cache is saturated, the TLC write of 2GB/s is still considerably fast, however the 970 PRO 1TB beats the 980 PRO 2TB in this region. And that is also perfectly normal because the 980 PRO uses TLC NAND. I am not saying that MLC NAND is definitely better than TLC NAND, but the point I want to drive home is to look at both drives in an objective manner and see which one fits your needs better. Whether you want a drive with shorter burst write speeds and more capacity or you don’t mind a slightly slower drive (at the beginning) with more endurance. The choice should be based on what you do, what you need and your workload.As for read speeds, the 980 PRO is definitely most of the time much faster than the older 970 PRO. Yes, the 980 PRO is definitely not the fastest PCIe 4.0 SSD you can find in the market with newer Phison E18 and Micron 176L TLC NAND SSDs on the market, but this is a fast SSD in its own right.Overall, I am very happy with this SSD. If you are looking for a balance of power consumption and speed, this is the SSD you might want to have on your consideration list', 'Got 2 pieces at a really good deal (came to about 110usd apiece just before prime day itself!). Shipment arrived within a week and works blazingly fast upon installation onto my mobo. Magician tool indicated that both were already at the latest firmware version, so did not have to worry about the 0E/03 errors that were hitting the headlines earlier this year. Idle temps are a tad high due to proximity of my M2_1 slot to the GPU, so might be in a market to get a heatsink.

There were some stutters and just low performance in general. I have this drive connected through the chipset of my motherboard (Z690 UD) because my OS drive is in the top slot connected directly to the CPU lanes. I haven't got any of the PCIe or m.2 devices in the other chipset slots so the P41 drive is unhindered as you can see by the benchmark. The games that I've moved to the drive run really well. Warzone was one of games that had stutters here and there on a HDD, those hitches have disappeared after moving to an SSDThe drive is very fast. One of the fastest Gen4 m.2 drives.

VALUE: Got it at a good price that was lower than several slower/smaller SSDs without a DRAM cache.2. SPEED: Delivered copy reaches advertised design read (3500 MB/s) and write speeds (3200 MB/s) - see attached image.3. EFFICIENCY: Despite the higher speed, my laptop unexpectedly ran 5-7 degrees cooler after replacing my old SSD with the P31, presumably due to the class-leading power efficiency of this SSD (see findings on page 3 of the P31 review by Tom's Hardware ).4. TIMELINESS OF DELIVERY: Classic underpromise, over-deliver approach - very admirably Japanese :) , JP seller committed delivery between Dec 15-Dec 22.  Actual Delivery by JP Post was on Dec 7.5. SIMPLICITY: Straightforward and fuss-free installation / cloning - even if the documentation was not as encompassing and thorough as materials from semiconductor manufacturers that have been selling direct to consumers for decades.DISLIKES //1. OEM FOCUS: SK Hynix SSD support site, videos and software were not as detailed, polished, exhaustive and consumer-friendly as those from Samsung, Seagate, Micron, WD, etc due to SK Hynix legacy emphasis on serving OEM customers rather than DirectToConsumer / retail / channels.  The SK Hynix customized/branded version of Macrium Reflect was relatively straightforward but SK Hynix Disk Manager (roughly similar functionality as Samsung Magician) was difficult to download, always freezing at 10-20%. The P31 firmware update was also harder to locate with relatively basic documentation.OVERALL:Though not as well-advertised and heavily promoted as the WD Blacks, Samsung 970 EVOs/PROs, Seagate Firecudas, etc of the world, the SK Hynix P31 1TB is a FANTASTIC value SSD.  For people who don't NEED the I/O performance of PCIE 4.0, (probably >97% of users, i.e. consumers not professionally running large mission-critical databases or provisioning hundreds of VMs, modeling weather or nuclear weapons, or similarly demanding applications), a solid PCIE 3.0 SSD probably represents the best balance of storage price, performance and efficiency.  Among the current crop of PCIE 3 SSDs, esp on sale, the SK Hynix P31 is one of the very BEST choices with it's speed (3500 MB/s R/ 3200 MB/s W peak transfer rate), long design life (750TBW), and class-leading low power and heat (a staggering 350 MB/s per watt for the P31 compared to 223 MB/s per watt for the much pricier Seagate Firecuda 520, 204 MB/s per watt for the Samsung 970 PRO, and almost double the 180 MB/s per watt of Crucial's P5 per Tom's Hardware)The lack of bells and whistles on the support site, software and related documentation is mitigated by the fact that the P31 simply works.  SK Hynix has come a LOOOOOOOOONG way from being a cheapo option for OEM players for RAM during its early years.  Nowhere is this transformation and increased capabilities more pronounced with its recent foray selling directly to consumers with the P31 Gold (and for those who will pay for PCIE 4 SSD throughput, the P41 Platinum).Will update review based on long-term performance but two days in, P31 Gold 1TB comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED unless significant discounts are available on other PCIE 3 SSDs with similar performance from equally established manufacturers backed by real-world reviews from multiple credible and authoritative sources."", ""My second SK Hynix product, the other being the Gold S31. SK Hynix product as known to be good quality and non-power hungry, this makes it a good add-on to my new laptop. There are about 1863GB of unallocated space as shown in the attached image. The average temperature I am seeing is around 44 Degree Celsius which is still bearable.

I came across an old posting (2020) in the ASUS website of someone reporting the same type of problem in a different motherboard. ASUS recommended that the PCI Express Native Power Management be set to DISABLED in the BIOS. I did that and the event log messages disappeared. Just wanted to share this with potential buyers of the Samsung 990 NVMe. The interesting thing is: the Samsung 980 never caused this problem in my 2 computers.=================================================I bought this drive to replace a Samsung 980 Pro 1TB which is working perfectly well but is becoming crowded as Windows 11 evolves and I install new applications.My computer has 4 NVMe sockets. The primary socket, where the Samsung 980 is installed, contains Windows 11 and operates at PCIe 4 speed, but the other 3 sockets only at PCIe 3 speed.The data migration using Samsung's Data Migration Tool went very well. However, when I connected the Samsung 990 into the primary socket the event log became filled with hundreds of warning messages, issued every 45 seconds or so, as described below:EventID: 17Event name: WHEA-LoggerEvent description: A corrected hardware error has occurred.There is nothing wrong with the Samsung 990 drive, itself. I know this because I tried it on the other secondary sockets operating at PCIe 3 speed and the error messages disappeared and I did not experience any issues with Windows 11 at all. The problem is: it is not fun to spend money on the fastest NVMe available to-date and have it installed in a socket that operates at less than half of the 990's rated speed.Searching the Internet for solutions I came across a large number of people reporting this error and engaging in a wild goose chase to solve it, mostly without success. Many suggested, and claimed, that they solved the problem by tweaking the computer BIOS. I do not want to tweak anything to get my computer to work properly, specially because I would not even know what to do.In hind sight I think I would have been better off buying the Samsung 980 Pro 2TB, instead. At least I have proof that the 980 is compatible with my motherboard. So, if you are planning to buy the Samsung 990 NVMe in any of its many incarnations (500GB, 1TB, 2TB, etc.) be prepared to face the issues that I and others are facing.

However, take note that the heat sink adds height (and, in my case, more annoyingly width to the SSD). SSDs with such heat sinks are not an option for upgrading a laptop or even many mini-PCs. Needless to say, removing the heat sink will void the warranty (thank you, Samsung), so be very careful with those if you're trying to shoehorn an SSD into a tight space. Having said that, performance is as good as it gets for gen 4 NVMe SSDs, and I highly recommend either this one or the one without the heat sink, depending on whether you are in a laptop-ish setup or not. If you are space-constrained, consider a heat sink that sits on top of one side and is held in place with a rubber band, if your laptop / mini-PC does not come with custom-made heatsinks for 2280 form factors (Dell XPS 15.6 does, and you can also find the spare parts inexpensively here on Amazon)."", 'Nothing to dislike, I imaged my boot drive to this, used a PCI express adapter ( no direct motherboard support) and now have a much faster booting machine.', ""With tax I paid about $180 for 2 terra bytes of additional storage for my PS5.

Seems that I have no issues or complaints until I install an update from Apple or an update from Parallels then it slows down again and I have to go and optimize and then it runs pretty fast for 3-4 days until another update! The intent of the SSD was to remove the fusion issues and just go solid SSD. If I bought a 2 TB drive, it would solve ONE problem but would not solve the needed space to give me more flexibility. I chose the 4 TB, even though it wasn\'t in my budget, to solve both problems at once and I am glad that I did and would recommend anyone to invest the money and move up to the extra space.This is really interesting for those who have a Mac but don\'t want to open up the computer to replace the drive.I bought a USB-C enclosure and made sure the cable has USB-C on both ends. USB will work fine, but why not go with USB-C and get better performance? I placed the SSD in the enclosure and after booting up the Mac and logging in, plugged the enclosure with the 4 TB SSD into a USB-C port. I formatted it (don\'t format as encrypted).I have been using Acronis True Image for a couple years now, so I didn\'t have to buy any software. I opened the app and chose to ""Clone"" and ensure that I chose the correct drives! Triple check so you don\'t lose your host drive. I started the process at 1:45 p.m. and by 7:30 p..m. same day cloning 1.6 TB of data, it was done.Next, I went to the disk utility to rename the cloned drive! Obviously since it is a clone, it will clone the name as well!!!! I put SSD as part of the name so I would be able to verify that I am actually booting from it.  I was able to reboot and holding down the option key able to boot into my SSD.Important step - go to the ""About This Mac"" and verify the startup disk is the cloned one!Now that I had a faster system, I chose to do some more updates on the OS and clean up my Windows 10 VM\'s. At first, everything seemed a little slow. That was expected as your Mac is optimizing things, as well as the Windows VM.When we buy a drive with more space than we may feel we need, something good happens... we alleviate risks and remove bad habits! With Parallels for Mac, it is essential that you take snapshots and create backups. Parallels will do this automatically, but you do need to ensure that you have the room. I was able to go to the settings and now, I will be able to access a backup up to two months old, a week old, and every other day. I feel better! Of course, backup to external drive but I feel better one of the most important part of my system is now being backed up automatically.The first few hours, I noticed a little bit of speed but not much but I knew why. Before I did the SSD upgrade, I never gave a lot of the VM\'s room to breathe or do the necessary updates and I had a lot of bottlenecks. I would use one VM for awhile but not another so I feel that Fusion was trying to optimize my experience but because of the size of the VM\'s (400gb +), it just wasn\'t getting it.After about 8 hours of updating, uninstalling apps I don\'t need in each of the Windows VM and just working through it, I am finally able to see some very fast appreciable and consistent speeds on both the Mac and the VM\'s.  Could I have optimized my Mac and Windows experience beforehand and would that have helped with performance? Yes, I do admit that I could\'ve done that and seen some improvements. In fact, my original fusion drive is still inside the Mac, so I could go back to the fusion drive and do all the optimizations!I always trust Samsung for SSD and have used them in servers before without having any issues. I am more than pleased with the performance and performing my work is so much faster now.I may choose to have the drive installed as an internal drive. I am grateful that I am able to boot to the SSD as an external drive and still see a major performance boost. It\'s well worth it!Overall, very pleased. The 4 TB was a bit out of my price range, but I made it happen and thankful that I did. I would love (as anyone else would be) for SSD 4TB and 8TB prices to come down 50% below what they are now. I have 24 TB of data that I would really love to convert to SSD but not at $800-$1,000 for the 8TB one. Come on Samsung! Let\'s do it and save the environment!', ""On Ubuntu 22 I used gparted to shrink a 4TB drive (only 1.5T used) to 2TB so that I could then clone everything to this 2TB SSD using Clonezilla. Time to shrink may have been about 10 hours and to clone maybe 3 hours. Now my system appears to be working as before but faster.  I think I chose some kind of 'proportional setting' in Clonezilla  to get this cloning to work.  Incidentally, instead of running gparted from a USB drive I used a SATA drive as a primary drive running Fedora as the OS and this worked. For Clonezilla I ran it from a DVD that I had burned. It would have been less hassle to just buy the 4T drive rather than do the shrinking but this seems just fine.""]"

In short, that space is wasted. It's a pain to access that from Windows Disk Management utility and that partition couldn't be touched. Went to AOMEI instead, cleared all the partitions and used AOMEI to clone my disk instead.Note that when using an NVME on some boards (mine's a Gigabyte Z170 Gaming 3), some SATA ports won't be available so be sure to check your MB manual. Also on MBs, the placement of the M2 slots aren't that ideal (I have on next to the CPU and another under the main PCIE slot, which could be problematic with heat.

Max temperature for PC711 was 46 degrees celcius with stock copper sheet wrapped out of factory. Please note benchmark for PC711 was carried out on an empty partion of a 512GB that is also using windows - that's why this would serve more as a casual comparison.Reason for getting this over SK Hynix P31 Gold was because of the warranty coverage that this provides.

What is to me the clincher is that WD (And Seagate) honors RMA for non-SG drives in Singapore, unlike other brands line Crucial/ Micron, Samsung, etc where you probably have to ship it out to the country of purchase or Manufacture out of your own pocket since their local distributors will likely not accept them. Also, 600TBW rating (for 1TB) and a 5 year warranty doesn't hurt at all!Plus, it is even more highly rated than the Samsung 970 Evo (non plus version).

Half a year later I wanted a larger drive for my surface so that I can dual boot it and use it like a giant kindle so I looked around and found out about the new Sabrent model.  I recall a rep talking about the 1TB model and stating they hope to be able to release a 2TB model if it fits their thermal specs and four months later things went well and we have this 2TB model.  If I had to do it again I would have put one of these in my steamdeck as well but luckily my weird 2TB drive is going strong but after great luck with Sabrent I\'m a happy camper with this 2TB drive in my Surface Pro 9.  I use Sabrent PCIe to M.2 adapters and I also use their 4TB gen 3 drives in a six drive ZFS array that I play game off of over 25Gbps OM4 optics.  So I trust Sabrent drives enough to offload all my high speed NAS usage needs to an all NVMe RAID built from their drives and I find their M.2 to PCIe adapters quite handy given I\'m using a motherboard lacking PCIe lanes to M.2 sockets so their adapter boards have come in handy in expanding my RAID to 6 drives and I bet I can pull off a 7th with a x8/x8 bifurcation adapter for my raptor lake CPU.I always thought M.2 2230 was a dumb standard, now I get it.  I hope the slightly longer standard of 42mm, starts to take off after the success of this product.  For those of you who are only familiar with M.2 2280, the way to decode that number is M.2 22mm x 80mm.  All M.2 drives in the consumer space are the same width (all are typically PCIe x4 so this can\'t change much) and so only the length of the card differs.  This is the shortest kind of M.2 since it\'s only 30mm in length, which is why it\'s a ""M.2 2230"" card.  Before you purchase this card, make sure you really need a short M.2 2230 drive, perhaps a 2242, 2280 (very common) will fit and on the plus side the performance should be better since higher end controllers can be used, especially in the very common M.2 2280 form factor (22mm by 80mm ""stick of gum"" form factor).  It\'s great that this card is gen 4 for future proofing, but most of the devices that can accomdinate this card today are not going to put that bandwidth to great use so expect some slight slowdowns (or a lot on the steamdeck, not that you should be expecting much there in the first place).Very happy using this product to dual boot Windows 11 Pro and Linux Mint 21.1, I think split the drive in half Windows:Linux 50:50 and it\'s working great.  Again make sure the device you are attempting to purchase this drive for really needs a M.2 2230 drive to fit.  I can use it on a Surface Pro 9 and Steamdeck which are small/thin requiring such a short (30mm) M.2 drive.  If your system can accomindate a longer drive like 80mm (M.2 2280) then get that since cooling will be better and performance much higher.  This drive is made for small stuff so use it in small stuff, otherwise go with something where the thermals/performance will be better, the only use case that makes sense of using this drive in a M.2 2280 socket would be to leverage the drive later in a compact device.  But for compact spaces this drive thrives and I\'m glad it was brought to the market.', 'Here\'s how I cloned the existing SSD in my Steam Deck without having to reinstall SteamOS or any games:• Put the old SSD into an external USB enclosure.• Create a bootable USB stick with the Pop!_OS installer.

Luckily, these guys made it pretty easy, and I can finally stop having that dang low space notification bother me!!!They have a couple of videos on their YouTube channel on how to install the SSD and reimage the Stream OS on there. You'll need some screw drivers, tweezers, a tool to pry it open, and some light as the parts can be a little hard to see. Be warned though that the screws are very, very tiny so be sure you put them in a spot that they can be easily retrievable. Even then, screwing them back in can be a nightmare because of how small they are! But once everything is out back together, follow the video on getting the Steam OS on there (this will require a computer and a flash drive with a way to connect it to the Steam Deck like a dongle). After you everything is set up, you're basically working with a fresh unit, but it's a small price to pay (apart from the cost of the SSD) for more storage, especially when you only went for the 64gb model like me.

There were a lot of stories about overheating and BSOD when trying to re-install Windows.  When I saw this Sabrent drive advertised on Amazon it specifically said Surface Pro compatible and that it ran cool, so I took a chance on it.  I am very pleased with the result.I'll do the TL;DR part up front:I upgraded my 256GB M.2 Drive on my Surface Pro 8 with the 1 TB Sabrent Rocket 2230 NVMe M.2 drive, and the drive runs great at PCIe 4.0 Speeds according to CrystalMark 8.  No BSOD and runs under 50 Celsius *EDIT*: Under maximum load, about 35 degrees celcius degrees idle/normal operations *END EDIT* according to CrystalDiskInfo 8.  I was able to copy all of my files using Acronis partitioning software you get to use free from Sabrent when you purchase their drive.If you want to know exactly how I copied everything over without ever having to go into the BIOS, keep reading:UPFRONT DISCLAIMER:  You will need to purchase three things to do this upgrade if you don't have them already.  Two of them you would need anyway if you were to upgrade like Microsoft suggests:  #4 Torx screwdriver/bit, thermal compound, and an external NVMe drive enclosure.1) First I did purchase an external NVMe enclosure to copy the old drive to the new one.  You can find them on Amazon for under $30 US.  You need to make sure the enclosure can take 2230 size drives.  I got one that had USB C to USB C cable and was thunderbolt compatible.  Another consideration is that after you swap the NVMe drives you can use the enclosure with your old drive and have another high speed hard drive to back stuff up on, although I found you will need an NVMe thermal pad/heatsink for the old drive or it can overheat.2) After reading about BSOD NVMe upgrade horror stories on the SP8 it lead me to articles talking about AHCI Link Power Management - HIPM/DIPM.  HIPM/DIPM power management is not on by default and you actually have to do a Windows registry edit to make it available.  There are some good guides on how to do this via a quick google search.  I recommend you enable it and turn the feature on.3) I had to disable drive encryption before copying files over (it is on by default).  You can either disable encryption or get a USB encryption key.  I chose to decrypt the drive which will take hours depending on how much data you have on the drive.  You can re-encrypt once everything is over to the new drive.THIS NEXT PART IS WHERE MOVING FILES OVER AND GETTING WINDOWS SETEP ON THE NEW DRIVE DIFFERS FROM WHAT MICROSOFT WANTS YOU TO DO.4) I cannot stress enough the kudos to Sabrent for having their own disk partition software.  Acronis, which you can get from Sabrent's website, will copy all of your files over for you verbatim; no reinstalling necessary.  Follow the disk cloning prompts, and the best part is it will automatically increase the size of your main windows drive to maximum while keeping your boot partition and recovery partition intact (just make sure you chose the correct cloning prompt).  Acronis alone makes it worth it to go with Sabrent.5) The SP8 comes with a front and back metal sleave for the NVMe drive.  YOU WILL NEED a #4 Torx screwdriver bit (very tiny!) to unscrew the drive and screw it back in.  The metal casing snaps off (do so gently so as not to bend the casing).  I cleaned off the thermal compound the old drive had, put in the Sabrent drive, re-applied some CPU thermal compound I already had, and put the casing back together, then screwed it back into the SP8.  A lot of videos show using a thermal pad instead of re-using the Microsoft drive enclosure.  I think the drive enclosure helps distribute heat evenly back into the SP8 chassis.I turned the SP8 on and it recognized me with all of my files intact without ever having to go into the BIOS the first time.  I have been running normally for almost two weeks and not a single issue.  Drive runs cool and fast.  Works great and couldn't be happier.I hope this helps you out if you are on the fence!"", 'I purchased the ""Base"" 64gb Steam Deck with the express intent of dropping a 1tb drive into it immediately after receiving it. After ensuring the system worked, I powered it down and did the swap.Everything went smoothly with no major issues during the swap over.Two things to be aware of if you\'re planning on doing the same thing:1. The sleeve on the OEM SSD is ever so slightly too small in diameter for the new drive. I had to peel it apart and wrap the new SSD versus just sliding it on and sliding it off. Not a huge issue at all, but something to be aware of.2. Make sure you clone or otherwise back up your OEM SSD so that you have the SteamOS to boot from after you install the new drive. I did not do this (because I was too excited to do the swap and just dove in without thinking) and got a boot error on power up after the swap. I had to download the SteamOS, use a thumb drive and convert it to a bootable device, load SteamOS onto that, and plug it in to my dock and command the Steam Deck to boot from it. In the process, I had to completely reset the Deck to factory specs. Not a huge deal, as I barely had any data on the OEM SSD, but if you\'ve owned your Steam Deck for a while and have data on your old drive, make sure to back everything up and clone the drive so you can boot up after the swap.So far, the new SSD is working excellently and I\'ve noticed zero issues with it.

I'm not very Bios and computer savvy, and I did run into some problems, and would like to explain what these problems are.This is a great hard drive (I will explain why in a second). I bought the 2 tb gen 3 version because my Asus motherboard (PRIME Z490-A) only supports gen 3 and not gen4. Gen 4 would work on the motherboard; however, I would not benefit from the increased speeds of a gen4. I know this, because my main M.2 drive with windows 10 on it is a gen 4 and it is not as fast as this Team group gen 3.My pc for the last few months had been running sluggishly. Thumbnails in folders with lots of graphics were loading slowly, and that horrible green line forming from left to right in Windows explorer was annoying. Moreover, my main drive which was a 1tb was getting rather full so I decided to buy this team group drive. Upon receiving the drive, I placed it into an Nvme external drive enclosure and cloned my internal C drive using Macrium reflect, a free software used for disk clones. The operation went smoothly, however, when using crystal disk mark, I noticed that my drive read and write speeds were very low or about half, on both the main M.2 and this new team group as well. My PC is clocked at 5-5.2 GHz, so something was not right.I spent a whole day researching this problem on the internet, and nobody really offered a real solution to the problem. The first thing is to check drive temperatures and mine were perfect around 40-45c. So, bad read and write speeds was not a throttling heat problem. This team group hard drive runs pretty cool, even without a heatsink or thermal strip. It turns out there are a few things we need to do in the BIOS to ensure these drives work at max capacity.First of all, I know this will sound stupid, (AND IT HAPPENED TO ME). When looking into your bios, imagine your BIOS page to be really TALL. Almost certainly you cannot see all the options without scrolling all the way down the page. I know this is silly, but in the advanced section of my Bios I could only see about 14 options on the left side, and the option I needed onboard device configuration is way under that.  You need to find this onboard function is any bios, not just the Asus bios and you need to set your M.1 and M.2 slots at full speed, other wise your Nvme drives are going to function at half the read and write rates.Once I made these changes both drives started reading at full speed. (crystaldisk mark is the software you need). My other drive is an older Corsair gen 4 drive with heatsink 9I paid a fortune for this 2 years ago), and it is not nearly as fast as this teamgroup, which went a little above 3500 mb/s.In a nutshell, so many people online complain that they are getting half the speeds with their Nvme drives, and do not know why. The answer is in your Bios! It’s not drivers, it’s not having your Sata devices enabled or disabled in the Bios, It’s not choosing between GEN1 GEN 2 GEN3 AND GEN 4 in the Bios. It’s simply the ONBOARD FUNCTIONS in the AVANCED area of the bios, which is down about 14-16 items in the list. You have to set your M.1 and M.2 SPEEDS ACCORDINGLY."", 'I wish it came with a screw but overall it worked right out of the box. Phison E12 and 4TB of TLC. I ran a benchmark using Samsung Magician and the sequential read/write are respectable and within the claimed range. They\'re not intended to saturate your PCI-Express bus with data but if you need a large capacity data archive and you can\'t have a 3.5"" or 2.5"" disk; then this is probably your next best. TBH, this is probably cheaper than a 4th 2.5"" SSD; faster, too.', 'I checked the chips myself after it arrived in the mail. It does in fact have a DRAM cache: a Nanya DDR3 chip. From what I have read online, this SSD can come with NAND flash and controllers from a few different companies, but all of them do seem to be legit, just different revisions. They all seem to perform roughly the same, and all have the Nanya DDR3 cache. Good deal for the money. An equivalent SSD from Samsung (2TB with DRAM) would be the SAMSUNG 980 PRO, and that costs $119 as of writing this review. That makes this SSD a $45 savings if you are willing to deal with the PRC state-owned companies that make some of the chips and negligibly slower speed (does not matter for almost any home/gaming user). It should also be noted that Teamgroup themselves are a Taiwanese (ROC) company, so I am not especially concerned about a few PRC state-owned company chips, as a Taiwanese company has almost certainly done their due diligence to vet the chips properly. Overall, an excellent SSD for most gaming or home users looking to save a buck! 9/10. -1 for my dislike of the PRC/CCP state-owned company affiliated chips.', ""Using with an Acasis TBU405 enclosure, definitely not 40Gbps but fast enough for my needs and no issues when checking the SMART status with DriveDX.I guess if I had more money than I knew what to do with I'd get the premium brands, but I don't and this has delivered wonderfully for the price.Sitting idle at 38C, after 10 minutes of BlackMagic testing with 4GB files it's up to 44C."", ""I just bought 5 of these drives for future use in the Asustor Flashstor 12 to test and leaving my initial findings. I've only tested in the Acasis 40Gbps thunderbolt enclosure that I've been using for Samsung 980 Pro cards where Blackmagic reports 2600MB/s write 2400MB/s read on the Samsung 980. This is by no means a scientific benchmark, just some ad-hoc testing to see if they'll be a fit for use in the Flashstor 12. No heatsink was used in testing.All 5 cards reported the same results and none were DOA. AmorphousDiskMark was reporting ~1700MB/s sequential read and ~1550MB/s sequential write. Blackmagic Disk Speed Test was reporting ~1400MB/s write and ~1600MB/s read. Sustained writes were good and tested with a 280GB transfer that averaged about 800MB/s. Each transfer started at ~1500MB/s and a minute later dropped down to ~900MB/s and a minute following it fluctuated on a regular internal between 300-900MB/s.So far it looks good for Flashstor use and will likely never see these numbers due to the implementation limitations of the Flashstor device (minimal PCI lanes available). The low price, good sustained write speed and high TBW are giving me a little more confidence given this is not (yet or maybe never will be) listed as officially compatible with the Flashstor."", 'This is a good drive either for your main computer or a NAS. Always get a drive with a DRAM cache.']"

I had to clone this partition to the nvme drive as well if I wanted to be able to boot, acronis doesn't allow for this. Instead I downloaded Macrium Reflect, which is available for free on their website (you don't need the paid version if you're upgrading your existing system with just this drive, however if you are thinking of changing your motherboard or any other major component you will need the full version)To anyone facing a similar problem the following are the exact steps I undertook:1. Download and Install Macrium Reflect Free2. Opened it up and selected the D: Drive (my 2TB Storage Drive) as the drive to be cloned, this I had to do purely because it contained the EFI Partition that was required to boot.3. As it is not possible to copy multiple partitions from different devices to the singular SSD i had to copy to, I dragged only the EFI Partition (I had two other partitions on the D Drive which remained unchecked, make sure they are unchecked) down to the grey area of my SSD (I used diskpart to delete all partitions on my new nvme SSD so that all the space remained Unallocated, unallocated space shows as grey, else it will be blue, its best to make sure that space is unallocated other wise you cant drag drop partitions. Remember to backup data if theres any on the Kingston SSD as it will be lost by making all space unallocated). And proceeded with the clone (You click continue, then it makes an XML File, then it proceeds with the cloning operation). This took just a few seconds as only the EFI Partition of 99 MB was cloned, leaving my new SSD (1 tb NVME, actual use is 931 gb) with 931 GB Free space.4. I then proceeded to drag down all the partitions one by one from my main drive (a 500 GB Crucial SSD having partitions say A, B, C), making sure they came in after the EFI Partition.So if the EFI partition was Partition 1 on the nvme drive, the partitions A, B and C on the 500 gb SSD became Parition 2, 3 and 4 respectively on the nvme5. I shut down the computer. Unplugged all drives except the nvme, leaving the nvme drive as the only storage drive in the system.6. I powered the system on.However the system would not boot, it would show the spinning windows dots logo and then reboot. So I turned the system off.7. I read somewhere about trying to unplug all usb devices including keyboard and mouse. so I Unplugged all usb devices including keyboard and mouse and powered the computer on.8. The computer this time booted fine and reached the lockscreen. I reconnected my Mouse and Keyboard and checked that all my files were there all my apps had installed and everything was just the way I left it on my old SSD. Even chrome opened the tabs I had closed on the other SSD. I also reconnected all my other USB peripherals, that I had disconnected earlier, now (this included a drawing tablet and a soundcard)9. I found that in moving the partitions from the old SSD to the new NVME, I had one partition of 488 GB and 453 GB unallocated space, this space however was not adjacent to my C drive, so disk management could not extend my C drive to utilize it. For this I got Easus Parititon Master and used it to join the C drive and the unallocated space to have a C drive that was 931 GB big.10. I shutdown the system and reconnected the 2 TB hdd. I restarted the computer (all usb peripherals were connected) and all was fine, my C drive is now 930 GB big with 453 GB free (instead of the earlier 488 gb big with 10 gb free :D) and the 2 TB HDD shows up just fine as well.""]"

Anche con queste prestazioni elevate, il WD_BLACK 2TB SN850X rimane sorprendentemente fresco. Questo mi ha dato la tranquillità che il mio disco rigido funzionerà in modo ottimale anche durante sessioni di utilizzo intense e prolungate.Inoltre, apprezzo l'affidabilità del marchio Western Digital, che mi ha fornito dischi rigidi di alta qualità nel corso degli anni. Posso dormire sonni tranquilli sapendo che il mio prezioso contenuto è al sicuro su questo SSD.WD_BLACK 2TB SN850X M.2 2280 PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD è senza dubbio uno dei migliori acquisti che abbia mai fatto per il mio computer. Le prestazioni eccezionali, l'ampia capacità di archiviazione e l'affidabilità di Western Digital hanno superato tutte le mie aspettative. Se stai cercando un SSD di alta qualità e prestazioni elevate, non posso che consigliarti il WD_BLACK SN850X. Non te ne pentirai!"", 'Für mein kürzlich erfolgtes Systemupgrade habe ich lange überlegt, welche m2.-SSD es werden sollte. Welche Größe, welcher Controller, welcher Hersteller?In die engere Wahl kamen schließlich die folgenden 2TB-Modelle, mit dem aktuell besten Mix von Preis, Leistung und (theoretischer) Haltbarkeit:- Samsung 980 Pro- WD_Black SN850X- Corsair MP600 Pro LPX- Kingston KC3000Letztendlich wurde es dann die WD_Black SN850X aus recht einfachen Gründen. Guter Preis (Primeday für 119€) und dass bei WD der Controller selbst entwickelt worden ist - sollten Probleme auftauchen, WD das beheben dieser Probleme also selber in der Hand hat.Windows 10 habe ich mittels Bootstick komplett frisch auf die WD_Black SN850X aufgespielt und bin bislang vollends zufrieden. Das booten bis zum Startbildschirm dauert lediglich 10 Sekunden. Erinnert sich noch jemand an die „guten, alten Zeiten“, wo das booten von HDD mehrere Minuten gedauert hat? 😉Ich habe bislang noch keine aufwendigen Spiele installiert und kann daher nicht sagen, ob sich da was massiv beschleunigt hat. Aber das Entpacken von großen Dateien (12GB und mehr) geht definitiv schneller als vorher bei meiner SATA-SSD - erheblich schneller sogar. Ob allerdings ein Umstieg von einer älteren m2.-SSD merkliche Vorteile bringt, möchte ich bezweifeln. Im Benchmark bestimmt, im Alltag auch…?Fazit:Ich halte nichts von Screenshots mit Benchmarkergebnissen. Jeder hat andere Komponenten verbaut und auch andere Nutzungsszenarien - insofern sind Benchmarks auch nur Momentaufnahmen mit begrenztem Wert.Fakt ist, eine schnelle m2.-SSD ist für HDD- und SATA-SSD-Umsteiger wie eine kalte Dusche.

Das heißt, dieser SSD Typ ist deutlich langlebiger und daher sehr gut als System-Speicher geeignet.Es handelt sich hierbei um die 2TB Variante ohne Heatsink/Kühlkörper. Daher wird von einer Verwendung in der PS5 abgeraten. Das kann ich nachvollziehen. Ich hatte die SSD für ein Backup in einem externen SSD Gehäuse verbaut, welches sehr heiß wurde.Mittlerweile hat die SSD eine Vielzahl an Stunden in meinem Notebook verbracht und bleibt selbst unter Last unter 60°C. Im normalen Betrieb steigt die Temperatur laut Western Digital Dashboard Software nicht über 50°C.', 'Ich habe mir vor Kurzem die WD Black SN850X NVMe SSD mit 2\xa0TB über Amazon gekauft, und ich bin absolut beeindruckt von der Leistung und Kapazität dieses Produkts! Die SSD hat meine Erwartungen weit übertroffen und bietet Geschwindigkeiten, die meine Computererfahrung auf ein völlig neues Niveau heben. Hier sind meine Eindrücke zu dieser leistungsstarken NVMe SSD:Blitzschnelle Geschwindigkeiten: Die Lese- und Schreibgeschwindigkeiten dieser SSD sind einfach unglaublich! Meine Dateiübertragungen erfolgen jetzt in Sekundenschnelle, und das Laden von Anwendungen oder Spielen geht deutlich schneller vonstatten. Ich kann spürbar kürzere Bootzeiten und reibungsloser Betriebssystem-Performance feststellen.Großzügige Kapazität: Mit 2\xa0TB bietet diese NVMe SSD mehr als genug Speicherplatz für meine wachsende Sammlung von Dateien, Spielen, Videos und Anwendungen. Ich habe nun ausreichend Platz, um all meine wichtigen Daten auf einer einzigen Hochleistungsfestplatte zu speichern.Zuverlässigkeit und Haltbarkeit: WD Black ist für seine hochwertigen Produkte bekannt, und diese NVMe SSD ist keine Ausnahme. Die SSD ist robust und zuverlässig, sodass ich mich auf eine langanhaltende Leistung verlassen kann.Kühlung und Wärmeableitung: Die SSD verfügt über ausgezeichnete Wärmeableitungseigenschaften, die die Temperaturen auch bei intensiver Nutzung niedrig halten. Dies trägt dazu bei, die Lebensdauer der SSD zu verlängern und gleichzeitig eine optimale Leistung zu gewährleisten.Einfache Installation: Die Installation der SSD war denkbar einfach. Sie ist mit den meisten modernen Motherboards kompatibel und die Einrichtung ging reibungslos und ohne Probleme vonstatten.Gaming-optimiert: Als Gamer ist die WD Black SN850X NVMe SSD ein absolutes Must-have! Sie bietet die schnellsten Ladezeiten für Spiele, sodass ich schneller ins Gameplay eintauchen kann und mich nicht mit langen Wartezeiten herumärgern muss.Insgesamt bin ich von der WD Black SN850X NVMe SSD mit 2\xa0TB restlos begeistert. Die Leistung, Geschwindigkeit und Kapazität haben meine Erwartungen übertroffen, und sie hat sich als großartige Investition erwiesen. Wenn Sie nach einer Hochleistung-SSD mit großer Kapazität suchen, ist diese WD Black SSD definitiv eine ausgezeichnete Wahl!', 'Puede haber diferencias y está bien.

Being this is slightly over 100 dollars for the 2TB version, it is worth it for the speed difference and size of drive.The CrystalDiskMark test is done on a laptop, not a desktop. So I didn't SEE it go over 7k. My WD_Black SN850 1TB is basically the same READ but about 4200 WRITE. (but it is a 2 year old drive) tested in the same Laptop slot.

Ich habe jetzt keinen großen Unterschied gemerkt.  Kann natürlich aber auch an den Anwendungen liegen. Will keinem der anderen reviews unterstellen, dass sie sich was einbilden.Für mich ist die Tatsache, dass ich jetzt 1Tb an Speicherplatz habe viel wichtiger.Meine Schlussfolgerung ist daher, dass man mit dieser ssd nicht wirklich was falsch machen kann. Sie ist nicht teurer als andere und falls die Geschwindigkeit für jemanden relevant ist sie auch eine der Schnellsten.

I saw new Amazon reviews where others were getting defective SSDs just like me! I heard nothing back from WD. So I called them on 8/7 and FINALLY had success. I was told they were out of inventory which is why they hadn\'t shipped my replacement but now had them in stock and would send me an email in 2-3 days with tracking info.  They emailed me the next day that they shipped my replacement (shipped 8/8/23). Arrived 8/10. It\'s been a month and SO FAR it\'s running okay. I\'m crossing my fingers this SSD has no issues. UPDATED my stars from 1 to 3 stars, and changed the headline.ORIGINAL REVIEW (8/5/23):I purchased this in April, and found out shortly after it was defective.Unfortunately it was after 30 days of purchase and I was unable to get support from Amazon. (They only have a 30 day return window)So I spoke to and shipped the product to Western Digital (SanDisk is now owned by them) as it was still under warranty. They SAID they are going to send me a replacement.Well...I\'ve been getting the run-around ever since! I just spoke to yet another representative just now who once again assured me my case was escalated and he\'d get back to me ""by the end of the day"".Another rep told me 48 hours I\'d hear back via email, and never did. I shipped them my SSD. They received it, and as of today I\'ve seen the status on my RMA move from pending, to accepted, to pending, to blank, to pending return.......etc. etc. etc. They confirmed receiving it, so what\'s the hold up?? No one seems to have an answer for why they just won\'t send me back a working SSD.I really just want a functioning product that I purchased. Money isn\'t exactly falling into my lap right now, and this was a ""big"" purchase for me and my home business. :(  I can\'t just ""waste"" money like this.Honestly...I don\'t know what is going on.

These were important features I was looking at since I care about data speeds not falling off during larger file transfers. This is where SLC cache and controller matters. The TBW (terabytes written) also is a great measure of SSD longevity. SSDs unlike normal drives, have a lifespan of how many terabytes can be written to them over their lifespan. Having a higher TBW is a great way to counter premature hardware failure with your ssd.', ""I bought this M.2 NVMe SSD for my Windows 11 system disk.  Before buying it, I read some online reviews carefully.  In particular, I was interested in the SSD's write speed after the SLC buffer had been filled.  (I shall call it the steady state write speed below.)  It was because after testing a few SSDs, I found this writing speeds and SLC buffer sizes varied widely.  For cheap and/or not well designed SSDs, the SLC buffer could be only a few GB and their steady state writing speed might be very low, e.g., below 20MB/s.  Because these parameters can not be determined by popular benchmarking programs such as CrystalDiskMark, it could degrade the computer performances.  Read speed is usually not a problem.From the review articles that I read, it indicates that the steady state writing speed of TEAMGROUP MP33 should be above 400 MB/s.  The SLC buffer should be able to contain 100 GB of data.  I think such a design is pretty good for me.  Another advantage of this SSD is that it uses TLC as the main memory.  It should be more reliable than the lower cost QLC memories.  Thus, I bought one from Amazon.After I received it, I did a few tests.  The test results from CrystalDiskMark is shown in the first figure attached.  It looks pretty good and meeting what specified by the manufacture.  To test the write speeds, I used the AIDA64 program's disk linear write test.  The results are shown in the second figure.  First of all, the write speed maintained above 1.5GP/s for data over 100GB.  This basically agrees with the published review results.  However, after that, the write speed further redused to about 200MB/s, and then, after the data written into the drive beyond 280GB, the write speed reached the stead state of about 100MB/s.  This is a little disappointing even though it should be O.K. for being used as a Windows PC's system drive.  I also did a test of writing an 100 GB data file to the SSD.  The result is shown in the third figure.  From the figure, it can be seen that the write data speed is maintained above 1.15GB/s and thus verified the previous conclusion.Overall, I think this SSD is pretty good, better than some other MVNe drives at similar cost.  The only concern is why the steady state is not as good as I read from some of the published reviews that I have seen.  That is why I give a 4 star rating hear.  However, I think it should be work satisfactory as a Windows 10/11 system disk without problem.""]"

Wenn Sie nach einer Möglichkeit suchen, die Geschwindigkeit und Reaktionsfähigkeit Ihres Systems zu verbessern, ist dies definitiv die richtige Wahl!', ""Ho acquistato l'SSD da 500Gb durante il black friday a 85€, che per un NVMe di fascia alta da 500Gb non è neanche così male (tra l'altro ora ad un mese dal black friday costa anche meno, com'è sta storia?)L'SSD è destinato a un nuovo computer con slot NVMe nativo (PCIE4). L'SSD è PCIE3 x4 e arriva ad una velocità davvero elevata, secondo il mio modesto parere è uno dei migliori come velocità per quanto riguarda gli SSD PCIE Gen3.INFORMAZIONI GENERALIQuesto SSD utilizza l'ultima generazione dei chip di memoria Samsung V-NAND di quinta generazione a 96 strati. In parole comprensibili ai comuni mortali, signfica che secondo Samsung l'SSD può reggere fino a 1200TBW (ovvero Terabytes Written, che con un uso normale del computer li raggiungerete magari in 20 anni, magari 10 se reinstallate il sistema operatvo ogni giorno per diletto), con una velocità di lettura e scrittura massima teorica di 3000 e passa Megabytes al secondo (lettura e scrittura sequenziale quindi quella che non capita quasi mai durante l'uso normale del computer) come potete leggere dalle caratteristiche e dai vari CrystalDiskMark che ci sono in giro. Il disco supporta tutte le faccende solite di Samsung, come la crittografia hardware (è necessario attivarla dal Samsung Magician e reinstallare il sistema operativo), e il TurboWrite. Generalmente considero abbastanza inutile l'uso di Samsung Magician, io lo installo solo per aggiornare il firmware (anche se questo disco è arrivato già con l'ultimo firmware) e poi lo disinstallo, in quanto è totalmente inutile.NE VALE LA PENA?La differenza tra uno di questi dischi fighi NVMe e un disco SSD SATA3 decente (quindi per esempio i vecchi Samsung 8xx Evo, o i WD BLUE) si nota? Secondo il mio modesto parere NO! Nell'uso normale non sfrutterete praticamente mai la lettura e scrittura sequenziale, bensì la lettura e scrittura randomica o comunque di file davvero piccoli, pertanto la differenza tra questi dischi fighi e quelli vecchi non è così marcata, in altre parole, io personalmente non noto differenze tra un 850 EVO (anno 2014) e questo nell'uso normale (!) del computer. Un hard disk di questa portata lo sfrutterete in situazioni di letture e scritture davvero pesanti, specialmente nello spostamento o elaborazione di file di grosse dimensioni. I caricamenti più frequenti come l'avvio di Windows o dei programmi non giovano particolarmente da questo tipo di dischi, anche perché sono caricamenti piuttosto brevi, quindi non si nota la differenza tra un caricamento che magari dura 3 secondi su un disco vecchio e 1.5 secondi su un disco nuovo, ammesso che il nuovo sia il doppio più veloce. Nel gaming la differenza si nota ma è nell'ambito di pochi secondi, diciamo che in un gioco pesante come Cyberpunk 2077 il caricamento da questo disco mi dura una decina di secondi mentre sul mio hard disk meccanico 7200RPM che uso per i giochi magari mi dura 15-20 secondi. È comunque giusto e comprensibile acquistare uno di questi dischi per un nuovo computer, diciamo che se invece state considerando l'acquisto per un PC che già gira bene con un SSD SATA3, potrebbe non valerne la pena. Uno dei motivi per cui ho scelto di prendere un nuovo disco NVMe anziché riciclare il mio vecchio 850 EVO è stato il fatto che avendo assemblato in un case mini itx, ho preferito risparmiare lo spazio che avrebbe occupato il disco SATA sfruttando la porta NVMe sulla scheda madre.PCIE3 o PCIE4?Sicuramente se utilizzate una nuova scheda madre AMD avrete gli NVMe nativi di quarta generazione (PCIe GEN4), quindi starete sicuramente considerando se potrebbe valere la pena o meno acquistare un SSD GEN4 al doppio del prezzo. Diciamo che considerando il fatto che nell'uso generico del computer non noterete la differenza tra uno di questi dischi e un SSD SATA3, la differenza tra un NVMe GEN3 come questo e un GEN4 (come per esempio il 980 Pro che costa il doppio) sarà ancora più impercettibile, al punto che la differenza al di fuori dei benchmark è quantificabile solo in operazioni altamente specifiche, come il trasferimento di dati diretto tra due SSD NVMe. Pertanto secondo il mio modesto parere con un SSD NVMe Gen3 come questo avrete già il massimo delle prestazioni possibili per la stragrande maggioranza delle applicazioni. Magari fra qualche anno varrà la pena prendere un SSD PCIe Gen4 per un computer da gaming o per l'uso generale, ma al momento non ne vale per niente la pena quindi andate tranquilli su uno di questi dischi Gen3 di fascia alta.TEMPERATURESicuramente se avete installato il programmino di Samsung (Magician, che è totalmente inutile tra l'altro) avrete notato che segnala temperature piuttosto elevate per questo disco, ma nulla di preoccupante perché secondo le specifiche tecniche di Samsung il disco regge fino a 70-80C e poi la velocità viene ridotta, non ci sono grossi problemi anche se il loro programmino dice che la temperatura è troppo elevata. Diciamo quindi che potrete seguire questo schema mentale per quanto riguarda le temperature di questo discoT<60C - Tutto okT>=70C - Un po' altina ma dovrebbe essere comunque tutto okT>80C - Se non state sforzando il disco a livelli estremi o se non state lavorando di fianco a un vulcano in eruzione, c'è qualcosa che non vaPertanto, io non mi preoccuperei molto della temperatura, non è necessario utilizzare un dissipatore per questo disco, ma se la vostra scheda madre ha il dissipatore integrato ben venga. Non è necessario togliere le etichette dal disco, mi risulta siano termoconduttive quindi potrete appiccicare eventuali dissipatori direttamente sopra il disco senza togliere le etichette.CONCLUSIONEIl disco fa il suo sporco lavoro, la velocità è notevole, e il prezzo è decisamente accettabile. Secondo me non vale la pena spendere di più, se avete bisogno di un nuovo SSD e volete passare all'NVMe questo va più che bene, il resto sono solo pippe mentali."", 'Nonostante la confezione sia ""nuova"" e siano passati parecchi mesi, la versione che ho ricevuto ha ancora il vecchio controller, mentre in comercio già un anno fa sono usciti i 970 EVO Plus con controller del 980.A parte questa digressione tecnica, possono dire che il disco si comporta molto bene e le velecoità che raggiunge (grazie alla interfaccia compatibile sulla proprio scheda madre) sono più che ottime (ho testato anche la PCIe gen 4 e personalmente nell\'uso lavorativo quotidiano non ho notato differenze ecclatanti).Quello che mi ha lasciato un pò perplesso è la temperatura di funzionamento (in idle) che risulta parecchio alta rispetto a quanto mi aspettassi, e questo nonsotante ho applicato impostationi dedicate alla gestione del disco (sotto Windows). Ho così applicato un pad termico (la mia scheda madre non ha un dissipatore dedicato per il disco) ed ora in idle e con temperature stanza più fresche sto intorno ai 40°C.Lo consiglio ? Senza dubbio, ma controllate temperature e magari se potete il controller.', 'Wie von Samsung gewohnt, alles Bestens mit der m2 SSD. Die Installation ist einfach und die SSD wird auch direkt unter Windows erkannt. Falls das nicht der Fall sein sollte, so muss man mit dem Diskmanager (so im Windows Startmenü eingeben) eine Partition erstellt werden.Es empfiehlt sich auch definitiv die Samsung Magican Software zu installieren. Mit der kann man nicht nur die SSD auf Firmwareupdates überprüfen, sondern auch Geschwindigkeitstest durchführen und den SSD Zustand überprüfen. Es sollte auch darauf geachtet werden, dass unter den Details der Samsung NVME Treiber verwendet wird und nicht der von Intel. Des Weiteren gilt bei SSDs die Daumenregel: Je höher der Speicher, desto höher auch die Geschwindigkeit.', 'El objetivo era reemplazar el SSD interno de mi MacBook Pro de 15 pulgadas  (med. 2014, mod.

En mi caso MacOs (con registro) y partición GUID (lo hice con la Utilidad de discos de Mac). Cloné el disco con Acronis Cyber protection. Al hacer el reemplazo, el ordenador la reconoció sin problemas. La SSD vieja (con casi 10 años) la guardo con todos los datos como copia de seguridad.

Die Übertragungsgeschwindigkeit zwischen einer mechanischen Festplatte und der SSD beträgt 1500 Mbit/s. Der Übergang zum Aufstellen der Spiele war einfach. Ich verwende Steam und es gibt die Möglichkeit, Unity-Spiele zu verschieben. Ich habe bereits schwere Spiele, deren Start eine Weile dauert, wie zum Beispiel Conan Exiles. Die Wartezeit wurde um die Hälfte reduziert. Für diesen Preis und in dem Wissen, dass diese Art von Speicher nicht so lange hält wie die mechanische Festplatte, erscheint sie mir nicht teuer.

Von der ersten Sekunde an, in der ich diese SSD installiert habe, war ich beeindruckt von ihrer blitzschnellen Leistung und Zuverlässigkeit.Der Unterschied im Vergleich zu herkömmlichen SATA-SSDs ist bemerkenswert. Mein System startet jetzt in Sekundenschnelle, und Anwendungen öffnen sich so schnell, dass ich manchmal zweimal hinsehen muss, um sicherzugehen, dass sie tatsächlich geladen sind. Das Kopieren und Verschieben großer Dateien ist ein Kinderspiel, und die Geschwindigkeiten, die ich erreiche, sind einfach phänomenal.Die Einrichtung war denkbar einfach. Dank des M.2 NVMe-Designs passt die SSD perfekt in meinen Desktop-PC, ohne zusätzlichen Platz zu beanspruchen. Das Samsung Magician-Softwaretool, das mit der SSD geliefert wird, bietet zudem eine intuitive Benutzeroberfläche, die es einfach macht, die Leistung zu überwachen und die SSD zu optimieren.Was die Langlebigkeit betrifft, so macht die 970 EVO Plus einen sehr robusten Eindruck. Die Kombination aus Samsungs V-NAND-Technologie und dem Phoenix-Controller sorgt nicht nur für Geschwindigkeit, sondern auch für Beständigkeit und Zuverlässigkeit.Abschließend kann ich sagen, dass der Wechsel zur Samsung 970 EVO Plus M.2 NVMe SSD eine der besten Entscheidungen war, die ich in Bezug auf PC-Upgrades getroffen habe. Für alle, die nach einem spürbaren Leistungsschub für ihr System suchen, ist dieses Produkt ein absolutes Muss. Ein echter Game-Changer! 👍🚀']"

This is all mounted in an extremely compact mITX case (SilverStone SG13B) with an overclocked 7700k i7 and a 1080ti SC2. My z270 EVGA Stinger motherboard has its single m2-SSD slot on the under/back side of the board where is almost no airflow (I have a small ""diverter"" panel I cut from some plastic to try and direct some of the air coming off the radiator under the board but the air does not have a clean path to exit).Before installing the thermal-pad/heatsink/sp-fans my Samsung 960Pro 512GB m2-SSD would idle at 40c, have a few programs open in the background with a video playing and 10 tabs open in chrome the SSD was barely being utilized but the temp would quickly creep up to 45-50c. A more more demanding read loading a game or encoding a video would spike to 60c and running a benchmark would peak the SSD at 72c where it appeared to throttle the speed. I was expecting to see high temps from all of the components of my system due to the mITX case and single intake fan, I was not worried about it as much as I just wanted to try to keep temps down so I could run the system as quietly as possible so I set out to try and improve things.As I mentioned I installed 2x fans (replacing a single fan) at the same time I install the SilverStone thermal-pad and GnomeTech heatsink along with a panel to try and divert some of the air from the radiator under the motherboard so I feel the results are about as ""best case"" as you can get other than having a fan blow directly across the SSD. With everything installed I closed the case and booted the system: I first noticed it took a few minutes longer after booting for the system to get up to the same 40c idle temp, I then launched my normal applications and websites and noticed again there was a delay before the temps started to increase and that increase was slowed noticeably. This trend continued when doing more read/write intensive activities, temps would slowly creep up into the same 55-60c range, even when using the SSD 100% with a benchmark it takes 30+ seconds longer for the drive to peak at 72c - when you can read/wire at 3500/2100 mbps that small amount of time at full speed is a lot more data! The drive also cools/returns to idle temps slightly quicker than before but it is not as dramatic of a change as the delay in temps increasing.My best guess is that the extra airflow from the new fans/ducting is having a minimal impact (drive still cools slowly) but the added mass of the thermal pad and heatsink is able to pull some of the heat/energy out of the SSD giving me more time before the drive will throttle. I was never hitting 72c in my normal usage so it hasn\'t solved any kind of problem as the system was running perfectly fine but I am happy that these parts, at least collectively, have made a noticeable change in the system. If someone has a computer where the m2 slot is in a more open location and they could have air moving directly over it I believe these parts could make a very real difference in the systems performance, possibly even preventing the SSD from getting hot enough to throttle.*All temps obtained from CPUID HWMonitor applicationTL:DR - These parts did not decrease my maximum temps but they were able to pull some heat away from my SSD to slow the increase and provide more time before the SSD would slow/throttle to control its temperature.', 'Easy NVME SSD installation.

I bought two of them (more on why in a bit).On the first drive I made the critical mistake of applying the heat sink.  Trying to be a good steward of thermal control, I removed the foil sticker over the memory chips and controller and then applied the heat sink that is included with the drive.  After installing in my case, I had the temperature at 48 degrees centigrade, which will not do (The old SSD was 29 degrees on average).  I moved it to another M.2 slop thinking it might get more air flow, but still 48 degrees.  I then tried in vain to remove the recently applied heat sink...apparently some very rigorous 3M glue is used for the adhesive.  In the process I broke off a diode or something from the drive's board.  Being my fault and all, I tossed it up as an expensive mistake and ordered another.  This time I didn't install the heat sink.  Guess what the temp was...yep 48 degrees.  It never changes, not under load or rest, not on boot or after extensive gaming.  Always 48 degrees.  I used two separate hardware monitoring apps and both report the exact same 48 degree reading. I will be applying my own after-market heatsink and I will just have to trust that it is keeping it cool.  For what it is worth, my other drive in the same system reports temperatures correctly, as did the old SSD this was replacing.The good: it has 4 TB of storage, it is fast enough for its generation, and it is cheap.  The controller has a Realtek icon on it, so at least they used a brand chip.The bad: The heat sink adhesive is too strong.  The temperature monitoring is fixed at 48 degrees.

The packaging is so-so the sticky part holding the SSD is a tad too strong I had to remove it carefully (worried that I would break it removing it.)Now the addition of the heatsink is a plus, and it's great for those that have motherboards that do not have them.  With that said though it's best to use the one they give you ONLY if your motherboard dose not have one nor use it it your going to use a external enclosure.  once you put it on it'll not come off easily so be aware of that.Speed Wise it's as good as my Team 2TB NVME SSD model TM8FPD002T0C101, my Intel 660p 2TB, and most other budget friendly models from other companies.  Game loading is still good, and compared to the latest Gen5 SSD being only 6-10 sec. faster on load times (1-5 for Gen4 SSDs) it's worth getting double the storage space with such a meager sacrifice in main loading screens wait times. (dose not affect in-game loading at all.)  In fact for the price of the fastest Gen5 SSD (GIGABYTE AORUS Gen5 10000) you can buy two of these, and some more games on Steam.Another thing this is perfect for is to buy a enclosure and make it a external drive.  USB with 5Gbps to 20Gbps (3.0 up to 3.2 gen 2) can only do up to 625MBps (3.0) to 2500MBps (3.2 Gen2) so it's pointless to buy a faster NVME SSD for a External Drive instead just have a lot more storage making it perfect for data backups or as a Live OS drive (like Batocera wink wink.)  Just as I said before if you plan to make it a external drive DO NOT put the provided heatsink on it.  The heatsink will not fit most enclosures, and yes I tried.UPDATE 6-4-2023:Okay they must have got the memo, because they have changed the heatsink, and packaging.  they now use a plastic housing so no more sticky glue on cardboard, and they changed the heatsink so it dose not wrap around the SSD which is better for those that have space issues like those that buy the 2x NVME to PCI-E X4 cards, and some external enclosures (there are some that still require you not put one on regardless).

It didn't disappoint, copying over the 1.2TB went fast with minimal slowdown during the long copy and has been working great while the video is being processed.But... I had originally installed in into a small Orico SMART-FV25 NVMe enclosure with a minimal heatsink (more or less it's a piece of spring metal that clips to the SSD and fits inside the enclosure), and during the 1.2TB copy the drive got very hot - hot enough that you couldn't hold it (60c-70c at least). I transferred the SSD to another enclosure I have that uses the whole body of the enclosure as a heatsink (a SABRENT EC-SNVE NVMe enclosure) and this seemed to have tamed the heat for this drive.Note that it only heated up this much while doing heavy copying to the drive (which is primarily why I got it, BTW). In normal operation it gets warm to the touch based on how much it's being written to, so while writing to the drive heats it up, reading from the drive doesn't seem to be as much of a problem.Keep this in mind if you are buying this where you'll be writing a lot of files to the drive and using it for processing the material on the disk. If I were to use it in a computer as a general-purpose drive, I would still ensure that it was adequately heatsinked there to avoid any potential problems as well."", 'I have 2, 2 TB and recently got the 1TB at a great price.  This is the best QLC drive because it has DRAM and relatively fast QLC.  What that means is that it is fast until the DRAM cache is used up and then it writes at native speeds.  But since this QLC is recent, the native speed is 500MB/sec, which is still faster than hard drives and SATA SSD.  Most QLC does not have DRAM and their speeds drop to slower than hard drives.  Until recently, pairing this with a RTL9210 USB 3.1G2 enclosure resulted in half speed transfers on a M1/M2 mac, but recent updates seem to address this.  So for $35 (1TB 670p) + $20 (enclosure), you can get a 10Gbps external enclosure for $55, which is amazing.  Note that you need to go to the Solidigm website (not intel) to get the software to firmware update this to 003C, which fixes a thermal throttling issue. This is great for applications that write not that often and read often, like a media drive.  I put a 2TB 670p into a Eversolo DMP-A6 and it works great, once I transferred the files in an enclosure first.', 'As of August 2023 I installed this and its working.  Its 2tb and its fast (fast as its rated)I know the big test with SSDs usually comes after some time... and this is being used as a storage disk and not the OS drive as the system already had a 500gb Western digital M.2 SSD for the last few months which was just not cutting it for storage.  At least if it explodes I wont lose my OS... and I will be able to log in to amazon and complain for you all.Keep in mind youll need installation hardware if your board doesnt have a screw and standoff already-  that stuff wont be included with an M.2 Drive generally.Ill update this review if it craps the best rest assured.', ""Bought 2 of these to upgrade some smaller capacity drives.  Cloned old drives onto these without issue and have been running great since.  One has a bunch of games on it and seems plenty fast enough for that.

There's not a lot to complain about here."", ""Needed a compact external storage drive.It will be used for backing up data an not for I/O intensive activities so the quad level cells in this are a good fit.I started with 1Tb of storage but it would have been very affordable to double that capacity.(I just thought that was overkill for it's anticipated use)"", ""Obviously it's not as fast as some of the more expensive ones, but that's OK.

So, I\'ve always used ""big brand name"" disk drives, and more recently, solid-state drives, and have stayed away from brand names I\'m unfamiliar with.Of course, this is exactly what the ""Amazon Vine"" program is for...  allowing brands which are less known to get products into the hands of trusted reviewers, and thus giving them the initial exposure which allows them to reach a larger market.  Sometimes this works out well for them, and other times...  if the product has issues... not nearly so well.I\'d never heard of Tridenite prior to seeing drives from them in my ""Vine review queue"" list.  So, decided to test-drive a couple of M.2 drives from them.Overall, I\'m reasonably impressed.  The drives seem to meet all the claimed specifications, and having used them fairly intensively (running benchmarking software) they seem to be reliable.One thing that they DO NOT have is what\'s called a ""DRAM cache.""  Many of the higher-end solid-state drives, including those I use in my main computer installations, do include that.  As explained by the technical site ""Techwiser,"" ""SSDs with DRAM is considerably quicker than DRAM-less SSDs in virtually every metric. The presence of a DRAM chip means that the CPU does not need to access the slower NAND chips for mapping tables while fetching data. DRAM being faster provides the location of stored data quickly for viewing or modification.""These Tridenite drives have only NAND chips, without that DRAM chip which handles the fastest transfers.  Of course, NAND is still faster (at least theoretically) than any physical hard disk is, but having a DRAM cache speeds things up quite a bit more on top of that.  For the best performance, y ou really need a drive with DRAM cache to handle the fastest operations between the drive and your computer (and then handle moving them to the slower NAND chips later, behind the scenes from your perspective)In the future, I suspect that NAND chips will be replaced with something faster, and this will become a moot point, but for now...  this is a real concern.As a result, drives without DRAM cache are significantly less quick for normal use, and are also a bit more ""risky"" to use (as things can back up during transfers to the slower NAND memory and data in that queue is more likely to get corrupted.SO... I would NOT recommend using these as the operating system/boot drive in a PC.  No place where there is a tremendous amount of ""routine"" activity, like that.But for supplementary drives?  Say, as a game drive, or a drive for storing documents and the like?  By all means, yes, this will work marvelously.In my own case, I\'ve decided to relocate both of my Tridenite M.2 drives (a 128GB and a 256GB version) into external USB-C (v3.2) cases, as ""ultra-fast external storage"" to carry large amounts of data back and forth.  They\'re exceptionally well-suited for that, and in this case, even with the very quick USB 3.2 speeds, even the ""slower"" NAND chips are much faster than the data transfer rates, so caching of data is irrelevant, anyway.These are nice drives, but without the DRAM cache, I would not recommend them for any especially punishing scenario and certainly not as a primary OS boot drive.', 'スペックにランダムアクセスが記載されておらず、非公表かと思っていたら届いた製品の箱にはバッチリ書いてあり、なんで商品説明には書かないのかと思ってしまいましたが、最終的にはこのスペックは全く合っていない事がわかりました。キャッシュDRAMを使わないPhison PS5013-E13Tコントローラーが使われている製品で、基板はPhisonのリファレンスデザインなのでしょうか、Q020013VF004403Nと書いてあり、検索すると色々出てきますが一番ヒットするのはCFDのEG2VNQシリーズでした。基盤設計から関わっている会社は少なく、ほとんどの場合はこういった製品を仕入れて自社のシールを貼り箱詰めってパターンでしょうから、正直こんなもんでしょう。スペックを比べるとかなりの違いがありこのスペックの違いは搭載NANDの性能の違いかななんてベンチマークを取ってみる前は思っていました。搭載のNANDチップにはIA5AG94BYAと書いてあり、型番的にはMicron製っぽいのですが、検索には全くヒットしませんでした。CFDの方のスペックは下記の通りで、Random Read以外は本製品の方がかなり低いなって印象でした。Sequential Read:2,400MB/s  Sequential Write:1,750MB/sRandom Read:130K IOPS  Random Write:370K IOPS（本製品のスペックは箱の画像を参照して下さい。）ところがベンチマークを取ってみるとCFDの方のスペックとほぼ同等の結果になるでは無いですかトータル的に見ると性能が大幅に向上していると言える様な結果です。起動時に大きな影響がありそうなRandom Writeが低い事は気になるものの、当初見劣りするなって思っていた性能が、価格的には十分な性能になっているのは良いのかな？それにしても製品の性能を正確に把握出来てない会社ってどうなんだってのが良く気になります。OEM元に任せっきりなんですかね、社会人としては普通な事じゃないだろって思いました。', 'まず販売ページの仕様よりも速度が出ます。多くの方がベンチ掲載されていますが、自分も測ったところ、シーケンシャルリード１Mで2463、シーケンシャルライト１Mで1872出ていました。なおランダム4kではリード29.45、ライト215.36で、逆転した数字になっていました。この台湾製でこの価格帯のNVMe SSD製品ですがいくつか使用したものの、基板の構成がとても似ています。というのも、以前試したARCANITEというブランドの製品が認識不安定という初期不良でした。ラベルを剥がしてみたところ、他の同時期・同価格帯ブランド製品の基板画像と見比べたら、細かい部品配置が99%レベルで一緒です。同製品をブランド名を変えて販売している可能性がありますがメモリチップやコントローラーで差別化している可能性も場合によりあるのかなと。そう思えるくらいに似てました。なおベンチマーク中のSSD温度を非接触温度計で測ると、室温26度にてコントローラー周辺（最もコネクタに近い部分）は55度前後、メモリチップ部分は38〜46度くらいでした。冷却については神経質にならなくても良い気がします。使ってみた感じ良好ではあるのですが、他の方もおっしゃるように、いくら使用より高い性能といえど乖離が大きい点は不安ですね。良い方への乖離ならまだ問題ないですが、TBWなんかが悪い方に乖離してたらと思うと不安ではあります。', 'M.2規格対応のSSDです。使用する場合には対応のスロットを備えている事が必要です。外部メディアとして使用する場合も同様のケースが必要です。サイズは一般的に出回っているtype2280。速度も悪くありません。ゲームや大きなデータを処理するような使い方がなければ恐らく不満を感じることはないと思います。なので購入時の価格が安ければアリかなと思います。個人的には512GBがコスパ良好だと感じます。256GBは探せば同じくらいの評価でもう少し安いものがあります。1GB以上はもう少し名の知れたメーカーの同等品と価格帯が被るので、これをあえて選ぶ理由は余り感じられません。タイムセールなどで安くなっていたら購入してもいいかなくらいですね。', '聞き覚えのないメーカーですが台湾のストレージメーカーのM.2 2280規格のNVMe SSD 256GBです。アクスメモリの取り扱いを行っているアクスグローバル合同会社が国内サポートを担当しています。SSDのファームウェアバージョンはEDFM0.0と表示されるとおり、低価格NVMe SSDで採用が多いPhisonのPS5013-E13コントローラを採用しています。PCI-Express 3.0 x4規格ですのでそこまで高速ではないもののSATAタイプのSSDよりはパフォーマンスが高くなります。片面にのみ部品が配置されている片面実装タイプのSSDです。ベンチマークは取っていませんが、NASのキャッシュ用SSDとして取り付け特に不具合なく動作しています。これといって特色の無いSSDではありますが、突出して価格が安い等の場合であれば選択してみるのはありかと思いました。', '同容量のSSDの中でもかなりお買い得な価格設定です自作PCの起動ドライブに使用しましたが、S-ATA SSDとはまた違った速さが嬉しいですデスクトップが表示された瞬間にEdgeが起動でき、直ぐにプリンターが使用可能なのですこれはHDD時代では到底無理なことでした有名メーカーのNVMe SSDからクローンを作り使用したのですが、新しいこともあり全く遜色ない使用感と速度だと感じていますただし以前使用していた有名メーカーの最上級S-ATA SSDが突然死したこともあり、それ以来あまりSSDを信用しておりませんそのため大切なデータは外付けHDDや別ドライブ、またはクラウドに保存しており、いつでもリカバリが可能であり起動ドライブが故障してもショックが最小限で済むように工夫していますこれは「TRIDENITE SSD」だからではなく、どんな高級SSDであっても壊れるときには壊れるということですなお外付けSSDとして使用するなら更に安心して使用できるでしょうFHDなんて標準で４K動画などを保存したりコピーしたり大容量のデータを使うなら最適なSSDです気に入って使用しているのは「ロジテック M.2 SSD ケース」です良くわからないメーカーの製品と違い安心して使用できそうなSSDケースがこれくらいだからです使用してみてもちょっと大きいかなというくらいで、全く問題はありませんので「TRIDENITE SSD」と共にお勧めできます', 'Windows10にて使用しております。こちら問題なく動作しており安定感があります。読み込み・書き込みなどのスピード感もさほど問題ありませんでした。']"

I don't see a way to ever take that heat sink back off to get to the SSD because the Heat Sink is now adhered to the SSD.

So far I encountered 2 very small incidents related to wifi connections and can't decide if they were caused by software or hardware, as soon as I restart the machine all is well, so it remains to be seen.

I make no guarantees about these instructions, this was just based on my experience.I have a Macbook that only had 256 GB of space, but performs very well otherwise, so I wanted room.  I never liked having to use an auxiliary external because then it's tethered and limited, and uses one of the two precious USB C ports.  I found this on Amazon and it had come down in price so I decided to give it a go.The kit contains all the tools you need to open up the Macbook and perform the SDD swap.  Here are a few notes.  First, I'd recommend using disposable gloves (latex or vinyl) to prevent getting any oil or transferring static charge to the components.  Second, I had to really (gently) work the back cover loose to get it off, and it almost felt like I was going to break it, but it DID come off when I lifted and wiggled it.  If you have a shower hook suction cup handy, I'd recommend using that on the back as opposed to prying up the back with a tool.  Then you can slide your fingers under and gently rock side to side to remove it.Third, the instructions say to disconnect the battery before removing the screws and SSD.  There's an image of it, but it's not super clear what you have to do.  Carefully remove the protective layer above the battery connector, and then gently slide the battery connector cable out.  This is also a good thing not to touch with bare fingers.  It looks more delicate than it is, but use caution with this.The rest of the install and putting everything back together was very smooth.  Then it was time to flip it over and boot it up.The kit contained a USB boot drive along with an adapter (USB C to USB A) to boot up the machine.  However, when I booted it up and attempted to use that, it told me it couldn't install.  I am not exactly sure what order what went on but ultimately it booted into Catalina, and I was able to update it online to Ventura with a couple of reboots.  From there, I was able to connect my Time Machine external, go into Applications->Utilities->Migration Assistant and use the backup drive to restore all my files, applications and settings.I did all that Saturday evening and used it much of the day yesterday, and it's performing like a champ!  Now I have 4x the space I originally did, and for not much cost either.  The kit is complete, I have a few new tools and the USB C to USB A adapter is also a useful component.All in all I'd highly recommend this to anyone comfortable opening up and working on a Macbook, and if you've never done that before, this is not a bad place to start if you need more space."", 'i am happy with the device, in apple they asked 300 pounds, i did myself quite straigtforward', 'le quedo y funcionó muy bien en la Mac, lo único es que ahora se le baja la pila en 5 minutos', 'I never swapped out a MacBook’s drive before but I was at a desperate point where I could only successfully boot maybe 1 out of every 10 tries.

Let me break down my experience with this high-speed storage solution.Lightning-Fast, Lag-Free Gaming on PS5The standout feature for me is its compatibility with the PS5 at this price point ($99 for 2TB). This SSD supports PCIe 4.0 and seamlessly integrates as expanded storage for the console. It also delivers a gaming experience that\'s incredibly smooth and devoid of lag.One of the under-the-hood advantages of the LEGEND 850 LITE is its inclusion of SLC Caching. This feature enhances system loading and data caching, resulting in smoother multitasking. It\'s the kind of performance boost that\'s not always apparent on the surface but makes a real difference when you\'re juggling various tasks.Speed Beyond ExpectationsDespite using it with a PCIe x1 adapter, which limits the speed to around 1GB/s, this SSD still shines. While some might consider this speed ""slow"" for NVMe, it\'s essential to put it into perspective. Compared to traditional SATA SSDs or HDDs, it\'s more than double the speed, making it a noticeable upgrade for storage-intensive tasks. Also, not using it at its fullest means I do not have to worry about overheating or insufficient airflow to it. which increases longevity of the drive.This SSD isn\'t just about the numbers, though. It\'s about the overall experience. Whether you\'re gaming, working with 3D graphics, or editing videos, the sequential read and write speeds of 5,000/4,200MB per second make a significant impact on your workflow.In summary, this SSD, the LEGEND 850 LITE, has transformed my gaming and multitasking experience. It\'s not just about the impressive specs; it\'s about the tangible benefits it brings to your everyday use. It\'s a powerful upgrade for those who demand more from their storage without breaking the bank.

The cost-efficient price tag places it squarely in the ""good value for the money"" category, appealing to budget-conscious users seeking ample storage and efficient operations.

HOWEVER make sure you have a SATA data and power cable also the right screws to mount it before you buy, they are not included (you should have a unused SATA power cable coming from your power supply)"", 'Still running strong 2 years later. Seems like a good drive', 'Buyer beware. The short story is this SSD killed my two other harddrives after installing it into my PC, while also not working itself - leaving me with 0 working drives. Even when I got a replacement, it almost fried my PC. If you want the full details, read below:My PC had 120 GB Samsung SSD that was running my Windows OS and a 1 TB Seagate HDD that I was running most of my games off of. I decided it was finally time to upgrade my storage so I can get the benefits of faster speeds for my gaming. I ordered this Teamgroup SSD because it was the the highest storage SSD at its low price range with still having good specs. I got the SSD next day with Prime and went straight to installing it in my PC.However, much to my horror, my PC, did not boot to Windows and i was met with an error screen saying no bootable device could be found. I thought maybe this was happening because the boot order got mixed up after adding a new drive, so I went into my BIOS. After opening my BIOS, only my 120 GB SSD/boot drive was detected. Neither my 1 TB HHD or the new 2 TB Teamgate SSD could be detected. I spent hours troubleshooting the problem (trying different SATA ports, different, BIOS settings, different power/data cables, looking online for answers, etc.), but there was no change in the problem.After hours of no success, I call my brother whom works as IT specialist to try to help. Together, we spend another several hours trying to troubleshoot/diagnose the issue to no avail. My 120 GB SSD/bootdrive could not boot into Windows - even though when attached to another PC it could detect all my files on the drive, check disc scans revealed no bad sectors, and we could even detect my working Windows OS being installed on there. The strange thing is, when compared to one of my brother\'s Window\'s drives on his PC, my 120 GB bootdrive showed a section of unpartritioned space that was the exact size of the typical boot section of a Windows drive. However, my 1 TB HDD and the brand new 2 TB Teamgroup SSD both were undetectable when plugged into my brother\'s PC.Neither of us (nor the internet) could figure out what caused the problem and how, nor could we fix it. But somehow, after installing this drive, it nuked the boot sector of my one drive, completely called my  1 TB drive (we couldn\'t find a way to access it to recover my date), nor did the brand new Teamgroup drive work. So after 8 hours of working on this, I cut my losses. Fortunately my brother had a spare 250 GB Samsung SSD that he let me have and we got a fresh install of Windows on so I can at least have a working computer. I also put my still working 120 GB drive. Even though neither of us could figure out the issue, we just assumed it was bad luck (e.g. ""maybe I got a bad drive,"" and maybe my HDD was on its last leg and just decided to die at this very moment,"" ""maybe all my bad luck happened all at once and it was a complete coincidence that this happened to occur after installing this new drive"").So, I started a return for the bad Teamgroup SSD. I requested a replacement instead of a refund under the assumption that I was just unlucky and got a bad drive, and that the next one would work as intended.Wrong.I got my second drive, and installed it into my PC using the cables/ports that I previously verified with working drives as being good. However, the moment I hit the power button after installing the replacement 2 TB Teamgroup SSD, I heard a spark and immediately noticed the strong smell of burning plastic. I instantly killed the power, used my nose to detect the source of the burning, and pulled out the brand new replacement Teamgroup SSD and found it was the culprit of the burning. I booted my PC up again and verified that my two other drives were still in find working order (fortunately the Teamgroup didn\'t kill them this time). I then tested the cables again by plugging in the power/data cables into one of my working drives and ruled out the cables being an issue. I checked my PSU, cables, motherboard, etc. for any signs of burning/damage and found no other sources of burning other then the smell coming from the Teamgroup SSD.I didn\'t bother trying to plug in the Teamgroup again to see if the drive itself could be detected or not. I am too afraid of it killing two more drives - or possibly frying my whole PC. This time I issued a refund for my money and I am just going to pay a little bit more to get a 2 TB Samsung SSD instead.UPDATE: I got the 2 TB Samsung SSD and installed it using the same cables/port I used for the two Teamgroup SSDs and the Samsung worked PERFECTLY with no issues. I can confidently rule out other issues and state that it was the Teamgroup SSDs that were the cause for my PC problems. Save yourself the headache and spend a little more to get an SSD that will not kill your PC.']"

Ya tenía en mente comprar un SSD para acelerar mi equipo de unos 4 años y estuve barajando este disco duro Crucial y los de la otra marca con más opiniones favorables y más ventas, el SAMSUMG 850 EVO.\nSamsung 850 EVO - Disco duro sólido (500 GB, Serial ATA III, 540 MB/s, 2.5""), negro\nEn cuanto a las comparaciónes de las características de ambos, que podemos encontrar en los ""Benchmark"" que existen por la web, vemos que tienen similares características y respuestas,  por lo que cualquiera de estos dos SDD es una excelente opción para comprar, ya que en el momento de escribir estas líneas, están en Amazon al mismo precio. En el momento que bajen alguno de los dos (como ocurrió el día del Prime Day) ese sería, en mi opinión, el disco duro a elegir, si el precio es similar, quizás el Samsung es la mejor opción por los comentarios de los compradores, aunque esto último es relativo y es una apreciación personal.En el caso del Crucial MX500 estas son:- Incoporpora Micron ® 3D NAND.- Soporta hasta SATA 6.0Gb/s (existen tres velocidades SATA I (1.5Gb/s), SATA II (3.0Gb/s) and SATA III (6.0Gb/s)).- 560 MB/s de lectura secuencial y 510 MB/s escritura máxima.- Garantía de 5 años por el fabricante (para España sólo 3).En el caso del Samsung 850 esta son:- Tecnología 3D V-NAND de Samsung.- Interfaz SATA 6 Gb/s, compatible con el interfaz SATA 3 Gb/s & SATA 1,5 Gb/s.- Hasta 540MB/s de lectura secuencial y 520MB/s de escritura- Garantía de 5 años por el fabricante.Otra opción es comprar el Crucial MX500 de 1Tb que tiene una relación precio/Gbyte excelente, pero era demasiado caro para mí, si el precio sigue rondando los 170 euros seguirá siendo una compra recomendable.Experiencia de compraEn cuanto a mi experiencia de compra, puntualizo lo siguiente. En el momento de comprarlo existía dos opciones: paquete abre fácil o con caja original, un poco más caro. El paquete abre fácil consiste en que el disco duro te lo envían en dentro de un blíster de plástico con las instrucciones de uso y con un sobre de cartón, tal y como he mostrado en las fotografías. En mi opinión  algo nefasto por que no protege el producto de golpes, al menos un sobre acolchado tendría que haberse incluido, por ser el producto del que se trata, aun así llegó en perfectas condiciones.Lo primero que hice es comprobar las horas de uso del disco duro, dicha comprobación dio por resultado que era un disco duro completamente nuevo y sin usar.MontajeEn mi caso monté el SSD como disco duro principal de mi portátil, sustituyendo el anterior por este y el normal lo he colocado en sustitución del grabador DVD del portátil, comprando para ello un adaptador.Como el SSD ya venía formateado realicé la instalación desde cero de Windows 10 en él, decir que si tienes licencia original digital del sistema operativo, una vez que este se instala correctamente, esa licencia digital  se actualiza y no se pierde. Teniendo de nuevo tu licencia completamente legal y activa.UsoUna vez montado y probado, el resultado es excepcional, se nota una enormidad el cambio de disco duro, el arranque es inmediato, la ejecución de aplicaciones, la instalación, etc., rejuvenece el ordenador en cuanto a velocidad de ejecución, es increíble lo que influye.Es recomendable instalar la aplicación Crucial Storage Executive desde la página de Crucial, te da información de la salud del disco duro entre otras y además permite actualizar el firmware del propio disco duro de forma fácil y cómoda. Ojo, en mí caso utilizando el actualizador automático de la aplicación hizo que entrara el sistema operativo en bucle, al estropear el sector de arranque, error reconocido por ellos, solución en mi caso: volver a instalar Windows 10 de nuevo.  Por lo tanto para evitar problemas actualizar el firmware desde el propio fichero del firmware descargado, no desde la opción automática del Crucial Storage Executive.Resumen final.Cosas que me ha gustado- Disco duro excelente al precio que lo compré, aun al precio actual lo sigue siendo, se nota una barbaridad el rendimiento del portátil con el instalado.- Al ser una memoria, no tiene ruido.- Al precio idéntico tanto el de Samsung como el Crucial es una excelente opción de compra.- Soporte en la web del fabricante tanto en software como en actualizaciones de firmware.Cosas que no me han gustado- El envío con escasa protección, aunque el producto sea nuevo sin usar, al menos un sobre acolchado sería lo ideal.Recomendable sin dudar por la relación calidad precio que tiene y por el rendimiento excelente. En la semana que llevo de uso, es el día y la noche en cuanto a velocidad de ejecución y de arranque con respecto al disco duro normal que tenía.Espero que esta opinión sea de utilidad.Edición después de un mes de uso.No he tenido ningún problema con el por ahora, ni pérdida de sistema operativo, ni sectores defectuosos ni nada por el estilo.

Denn was kann man nach 1 Monat schon sagen?Sicherlich vieles zur Leistungsfähigkeit und Stabilität des Systems, aber nichts über die Langlebigkeit der SSD.Da viele sich bestimmt dafür interessieren wie schnell die  4TB Version der SSD wirklich ist, oder wie es um die Kompatibilität steht und auch ich hierzu zuvor leider nichts fand, möchte ich euch diese Informationen so gut wie möglich zur Verfügung stellen.Vielleicht interessieren manche auch die verbauten Chips.Gekauft wurde die 4TB Version der M.2 SS am 4. Oktober 2020D für mein Asus ZenBook Pro Duo 15 (UX581) UX581GV-H2004T. Produktinfos spare ich mir an dieser Stelle und gehe lieber auf die Kerndaten des Testsystems ein:Intel Core i7-9750H - 16 GB RAM - Ursprünglich mit 512 GB SSD mit nur ca ~1000MB/s von Hynix - nVidia GeForce RTX 2060  - Windows 10 Home 64 bit - also leistungsstark.Die zuvor verbaute SSD war mir zu klein und ich hatte auch den Eindruck, dass sie das System extrem ausbremst und zu Rucklern führt, da war eine 4TB SSD schon sehr verlockend.Ich wollte jedoch keine QLC SSD wie die von Sabrent, die auch noch mehr gekostet hätte und nicht gerade mit positivsten Bewertungen geglänzt hatte.Viele Alternativen gibt es ja derzeit leider nicht mit Kapazitäten ab 4TB und mit dieser geringen Einbaugrösse. Noch weniger Alternativen gibt es, wenn man TLC statt QLC Chips möchte.Mittlerweile gibt es auch günstigere QLC Versionen mit Kapazitäten von 4TB und 8TB von diesem Hersteller.Wie es eben bei fast jedem Hersteller ist, werden verlötete Komponenten meist von anderen Firmen gekauft und nicht selbst hergestellt.Aufgelötete Chips:Vermutlich der DRAM Cache mit je 256Mb x16 (laut Datasheet vom Hersteller NANYA):Anzahl: 2xNANYA1938NT5CC256M16ER-EK923376ABEP L TWWichtig: Megabit, nicht Megabyte!Somit handelt es sich bei einem einzigen der Chips um 512 Megabyte RAM, somit in der Summe 1 Gigabyte RAM auf der SSD.Speicherchips (3D TLC):Menge: 8xTA8HG65AWV02031N3607857Nach Recherchen und einer Japanischen Seite als Quelle angeblich von Toshiba, mehr finde ich aktuell nicht dazu.Die Produktnummer scheint jedoch dem typischen Aufbau anderer Toshibaprodukte zu entsprechen und auch die anderen Modelle der MP510 nutzen wohl Toshiba Chips.Die Aufkleber habe ich nicht entfernt, ich weiss also nicht was sich noch darunter verbirgt.Der verbaute Controller wird ja vom Hersteller offiziell angegeben (Phison PS5012-E12) und viel mehr hat nicht Platz.Einbau:Da die Frage bereits aufkam gleich vorweg: Ja die SSD ist beidseitig bestückt.Der Einbau ist bei jeder SSD je nach Endgerät unterschiedlich.Bei meinem ZenBook war der Einbau an sich sehr einfach und die SSD passt perfekt, man muss wegen der breiten Chips auf der Rückseite vor dem Festschrauben nur das Kabel welches an der SSD vorbei geht und am Ende leicht schräg verläuft zur Seite halten, da es sonst ggf zwischen den rückseitigen Speicher-Chips und Mainboard gequetscht werden könnte, was weder für SSD noch für das Kabel gut sein dürfte. Ich musste das Kabel im Gehäuse auch etwas nachschieben um die Spannung im Bereich der SSD zu reduzieren, es war zum Glück lang genug.Bei der vorherigen Hynix war die SSD auf der Rückseite nicht bestückt, weshalb das Kabel dort keine Hürde darstellte.Der M.2 Sockel bietet bereits eine leichte Distanz/Anhebung zum Mainboard, so dass die rückseitigen Chips hier perfekt dazwischen passen.Ist das Kabel sauber an der SSD vorbeigelegt, ist auch der Widerstand beim Festschrauben weg.Achtet darauf, dass euer Gerät etwas Platz für die rückseitigen Chips bietet.Kompatibilität und Migration:Die SSD wurde im BIOS mitsamt Kapazität sofort angezeigt, doch leider hatte ich erst Probleme damit, die SSD bzw konkreter das System mit dieser verbauten SSD zum laufen zu bringen. Es handelt sich nicht um meine erste SSD die ich ausgetauscht habe und ich bin auch sonst schon seit 25 Jahren sehr erfahren mit IT.Ironischerweise funktionierte nicht einmal mein Windows 10 Installationsstick in der neuesten Version. Alle Windowsbasierten Bootmedien stürzten ab und starteten noch beim schwarzen Bildschirm mit Ladekreis neu.Habe ich die SSD herausgenommen, starteten sie jedoch einwandfrei.Ubuntu startete zwar, GParted zeigte die SSD jedoch nicht - das war ein Problem.Ich musste also etwas anderes probieren und baute nach einer Datensicherung der alten SSD die neue SSD in mein 3 Jahre älteres Core i7-8550U Notebook (HP Envy 15-bp130ng) ein, um das Backup aufzuspielen. Das klappte einwandfrei! Hier gab es übrigens auch kein Kabel auf welches man beim Einbau hätte achten müssen und Platz war für die Rückseitige Bestückung genug da.Mein Verdacht war, dass das BIOS vom ZenBook blöd/mangelhaft ist und Probleme mit SSDs ohne aufgespieltem UEFI Bootloarder haben könnte.Ich baute die 4TB SSD wieder ins ZenBook ein und nun wurde auch die SSD wie erwartet als Bootmedium aufgelistet. Ich konnte nur leider noch immer nicht davon booten.Wieder gab es eine Bootloop wie beim Booten von USB und auch die automatische Systemreparatur startete nicht von der SSD,. Eine Änderung gab es aber: Ich bekam ich irgendwann zusätzlich Bluescreens. Aber ich war endlich einen entscheidenden Schritt weiter, nun wusste ich dass sie grundsätzlich funktionieren würde weil Daten gelesen werden.Ich musste unterm Strich zum Schluss den Modus des M.2 Anschlusses im BIOS umstellen, dann konnte ich zumindest schon mal die Systemreparatur starten, was mir jedoch alleine noch nicht weiterhalf.Ich startete danach in den abgesicherten Modus mit Netzwerktreibern was glücklicherweise einwandfrei klappte - ein Hoffnungsschimmer.Ich startete ohne Änderungen vorgenommen zu haben gleich danach neu und Windows startete plötzlich fehlerfrei - tada!Eine schwere Geburt. Ich denke im anderen Notebook hätte es diese Probleme nicht gegeben. Dort starteten auch die USB Bootmedien noch problemlos und eine testweise Windows Neuinstallation vor dem Aufspielen des Backups klappte ebenfalls auf die neue SSD.Ich glaube das BIOS vom ZenBook ist wohl etwas dämlich und zickig.Ich befürchtete fast, dass die SSD durch die Umstellung des M.2 Modus nun mit SATA-Geschwindigkeit laufen würde, das war dann aber glücklicherweise nicht der Fall.Geschwindigkeit:Die versprochene Geschwindigkeit wird auch mit Daten drauf nahezu erreicht. Immer eine Frage wie man testet. Und wie oft überträgt man schon mit der Maximalgeschwindigkeit?Die Geschwindigkeit spielt bei mir eher eine Rolle für die Reaktionsgeschwindigkeit des Systems und für die Auslagerungsdatei.Ich habe die Screenshots der Benchmarks mit Atto Disk Benchmark (max Read 2800 MB/s / Write 2700 MB/s) und CrystalDiskMark (max Read 3227 MB/s / Write 2959 MB/s) angehängt.Die SSD war zu diesem Zeitpunkt mit 2.15TB Daten befüllt und jeweils ""kalt"".Bei leerer SSD sieht die Geschwindigkeit übrigens nicht anders aus.Temperatur:Ist schwer zu beurteilen. Nachdem ich 2TB Daten von meiner externen SATA SSD mit etwa 400-500MB/s kopiert hatte, war der Bereich der SSD am Notebook noch nicht einmal handwarm. Das war er aber auch vor dem Kopieren schon.Ich kann keine Hitzeentwicklung bei meiner bisherigen Verwendung feststellen.Beim Einbau wurde das Wärmeleitpad wieder angebracht, welches die Hitze auf das Aluminiumgehäuse ableitet.Das Asus ZenBook Pro Duo scheint aber generell eine extrem effiziente Kühlung zu haben.Sicherlich werden alle SSDs bei extremer Dauerlast heiss, so wie diese bestimmt auch.Zwischenfazit:Insgesamt ruckelt das System nun weniger und alle Reaktions- sowie Ladezeiten sind auf dem gewohnten Niveau meiner Samsung 960 PRO 512GB NVMe M.2 SSD aus meinem anderen Notebook.Gespannt bin ich auf die langfristige Stabilität, Haltbarkeit und Zuverlässigkeit der mutmasslichen Toshiba TLC Zellen.Die TBW dürfte ich vermutlich die nächsten Jahre nicht annäherend erreichen, da die Daten meist auf der SSD verbleiben und vermutlich ist bis dahin vielleicht schon eine 16TB SSD auf dem Markt die ich dann eingebaut habe.Das System läuft bislang stabil und ohne Abstürze oder Einschränkungen.Sollte sich an meiner Erfahrung mit der derzeit noch recht teuren (704,-) SSD noch etwas ändern, werde ich die Rezension überarbeiten.Ich hoffe diese vorläufige Bewertung konnte euch die Entscheidungsfindung etwas erleichtern und euch mit ausreichend Informationen versorgen.', ""Corsair un très bonne marque depuis longtemps , quand j'allume mon pc en même pas 2 sec je suis au bureau très rapide !"", '熱に弱いかもしれません、グラボの真上にm.2の刺さる場所があるのですが、新品買って半年ぐらいでブルースクリーンになり3カ月に1回2カ月に１回とブルースクリーンになる感覚が短くなっていき先日壊れました。マザーボードはb550トマホーク、マザーボードのエラーは毎回bootが光ってました。熱対策を万全にすればもう少し長く使えたかもしれません。', 'Mit Lesegeschwindigkeiten von bis zu 3.480 MB/s und sequenziellen Schreibgeschwindigkeiten von bis zu 2.000 MB/s sorgt diese SSD für eine blitzschnelle Datenübertragung und verkürzt die Ladezeiten erheblich. Egal ob es um das Hochladen von Dateien, das Installieren von Anwendungen oder das Öffnen von großen Projekten geht - diese SSD bewältigt alles mit Leichtigkeit.Die Installation war denkbar einfach, da die SSD im M.2-Format kommt und sich problemlos in meinen Laptop einfügen ließ. Die mitgelieferte Software zur SSD-Verwaltung von Corsair bietet eine benutzerfreundliche Möglichkeit, die Leistung und den Zustand der SSD zu überwachen.Die Wärmeableitung ist effizient, und die Temperatur bleibt auch bei intensiver Nutzung stabil.Während die Leistung dieser SSD unbestreitbar beeindruckend ist, könnte der Preis für einige Anwender möglicherweise etwas hoch sein. Dennoch, wenn man auf der Suche nach einer Hochleistungs-SSD ist, die eine spürbare Verbesserung der Systemleistung bietet, dann ist die Corsair MP510 definitiv eine Überlegung wert.', 'Déjà commandé sur un autre site, les caractéristiques bonnes, chauffe peu, utilisé pour le systeme.Déçu qu\'ils aient essayé de duper un client en envoyant un ""MP600 Core XT"" au lieu de la référence vendue.Attention à vous.Pas de SSD renvoyé et 10€ dans la vue.

I got the 128GB version, so it gives me more room to install additional software.  One important caveat is that you update all of your firmware on the Pi to boot from USB 3 first.

(SUR ORDI INTEL i9 et 128 Go RAM°Excellent produit !!!"", 'You need to have the screw handy as not supplied with drive!', ""I did a lot of research on SSD's before buying this model. Most people pay attention to the capacity or the speed of the read/writes. I already had a blazing fast M.2 SSD in my first slot, but I really wanted something that would be good for storing a lot of data read/write/delete.  This Corsair model has the highest endurance rating for Terabytes Written. I suppose only time will tell, but I am hopeful they deliver on this potential. The generous heatsink is a good value add for the second M.2 slot which doesn't come with it's own heat shield. I bought this drive while on sale at a price that beats most entry level value brands which are only PCIe3 drives. This Corsair drive offers TBW of 6-8 times those value brands, while also offering middle of the road PCIe4 speeds. The real world difference between the 5000Mbps speeds this drive has versus the top tier 7300Mbps speeds is pretty much nil unless you are a heavy gamer.  I do some light casual gaming and haven't noticed any difference in moving data between my boot drive and my data drive.I think Corsair should be commended for offering a drive with this type of endurance. I have always been partial to this brand as a good value and this SSD is no different. It is a touch pricey at MSRP, but still a solid buy. If you are looking for an M.2 SSD with strong PCIe4 speeds, a built-in heatsink, and best in class endurance, this is a no brainer. The only caveat is that Corsair has reserved more of the drive memory to achieve the longer endurance. This just means you have marginally less capacity to use, but for the 1TB model I bought, it is the difference of about 300MB between this drive and my other SSD.  I think this trade off is very reasonable if endurance is your top priority. The only other options I could find that were close to these endurance ratings all cost at least double this drive. It won't win any awards for top tier speeds. I actually have it installed in a PCIe3 slot as my Motherboard only has one PCIe4 slot, so speed was not a priority for me. This ends up throttling it back from 5000Mbps to 3300Mbps and it still feels just as snappy as my 73000Mbps PCIe4 SSD. Highly recommended, depending on your needs.  Note that removing the heatsink will void the warranty though, so if you don't need an SSD with a heatsink, you may want to keep looking."", 'I dont have any pictures of this drive but i built a gaming pc for my brother and when it is paired withCorsair H100x RGB Elite Liquid CPU CoolerCorsair Vengeance LPX 32GB (2 X 16GB) DDR4 3600CORSAIR RM Series (2021), RM750, 750 Watt, 80 PlusIntel Core i7-12700K Desktop Processor 12ASUS TUF Gaming H670-PRO WiFi D4 LGA 1700 (or similar motherboards)you can play fortnite, gta5 (at mid graphics settings) and many other games without a graphics card so when you add a gpuit will unleash ALOT more potential my brother and i are very pleased so far and i still think he is running without a gpu', 'Con este producto, la verdad no se muy bien como valorarlo.

Fast and easy.The data migration software is NOT “Magician,” as another reviewer stated— that is a disk utility, not a migration tool.The data migration software DOES migrate from non-Samsung drives (unlike what that same reviewer claimed).  Of course it does.  Worked like a charm.You connect an appropriate cable to the drive and your computer’s USB, and run the DATA MIGRATION program.It asks you to choose which Samsung drive you are migrating to, and then it has a dropdown box that will show you all the drives it sees on your computer.  In my case, there was just the one drive on my ASUS laptop— a Seagate, from which I would migrate.My connection was using the “Sabrent 2.5 SATA hard drive/ssd to USB adapter cable.”The default setting was to make the new Samsung 860 EVO a bootable drive.I started the migration, and by the time I put my mouse away, it was at 3% of my 500GB of data on the Seagate’s 1T drive, and showed an estimate of about an hour and a half.  However, it was done in less than an hour, and as the instructions stated, it powered down my computer when done.Flipping my ASUS on its back, I removed the screws, and the bottom came off easily.  The old Seagate was easily accessible, so I removed it, unplugged, plopped in the Samsung, plugged it in after securing it, reinstalled the laptop bottom, flipped it upright and hit the power button.For almost two years, that meant It would be several minutes before Windows asked me to scan my fingerprint, and then another ten to fifteen minutes before Windows was actually done loading its background stuff so that it was useable.I remembered my wireless mouse, and before I plugged the little wireless piece into a USB port, I was being asked for my fingerprint— less than 15 seconds.  I thought, *This is too good to be true.*I scanned my finger, and turned the mouse over to turn it on, and when I looked up, ten seconds later, my desktop was fully loaded and functioning.  Whatever laborious background tasks Windows does at startup, were already done.  That ten to fifteen minutes of constant disk access I had always endured was complete— and gone from my life forever.Again, I thought, *This was too easy.  Something is going to go wrong.*But nothing did go wrong.  My laptop now boots in seconds, is fully functional, everything loads about as quickly as my apps do on my IPad.  She’s a little hotrod.Thank you Samsung.  To ASUS’ defense, the version I got was intended to be a SSD driven machine, but they sold the mechanical disk version as an introduction package.  The retailer offered to do the upgrade to SSD for me, but I did not have time to leave it with them.', 'Ich mag diese Samsung SSD. Sie ist nicht so teuer wie die PRO und hat dennoch genügend Power und Geschwindigkeit, um sich hervorragend zu empfehlen. Ich verbaue jetzt bereits seit einigen Jahren SATA-SSDs in Laptops/Notebooks und Desktop-PCs. Die Samsungs sind alle grundsolide und empfehlenswert, selbst die etwas günstigere 750 EVO seinerzeit, die allerdings nicht so gut wie die 800er Reihe war. Die 800er nutzen eine 3(D)-Layer-Nand-Struktur und die 750 hatte das meines Wissens nicht, weshalb sie nicht so schnell war wie die 800er. Auch nicht so legendär langlebig.Etliche Leute, deren Computer ich somit ""gepimpt"", also modifiziert habe, nutzen nun noch immer ihre Geräte, die sie sonst am liebsten verschrottet hätten. Somit sind die Computer wieder fit für die nächsten Jahre. Im Desktop-PC verbaue ich die SSD im Einbaurahmen, im Laptop braucht man sowas nicht wegen des kleineren Formfaktors (2,5 Zoll statt 3,5 Zoll). Cloning, also ""Data Migration"" mache ich mit dem Samsung-Tool, außerdem gibt es von Samsung ein Überwachungstool für die SSD, mit dem man auf Firmware-Updates, den ""Gesundheits-Zustand"" der SSD und die Leistungsfähigkeit prüfen kann. Beim Cloning schließe ich die SSD extern per USB-SATA-Kabel an. Das funktioniert gut. Die SSD wird auch immer hübsch vom Microsoft Windows erkannt und als SSD mit der dafür vorgesehenen Performance genutzt (ab Windows 7). Nur ab und zu muss ich bei Desktop-PCs die SSD als neues Boot-Laufwerk priorisieren, wenn nur ein einziger Datenträger vorhanden ist, entfällt das logischer Weise weil der Computer dann kein anderes Laufwerk zum Booten ansteuern kann.Die SSD ist so schnell, wie SATA es maximal möglich macht, nicht mehr und nicht weniger. SATA 2 ist nicht so schnell wie SATA 3, klar, aber manche Computer haben halt nur ein (altes) Mainboard, das SATA 3 nicht verwendet. Ich habe mal einen Screenshot hochgeladen zum SATA 2-Speed auf einem ca. 10 bis 11 Jahre alten Laptop, der kein SATA 3 sondern nur SATA 2 hat und einen Intel Core i5-Zweikerner mit 4 Workern verwendet. Die hier verwendete EVO ist eine 500GB Variante. Schneller als jede HDD ist die SSD ohnehin. Die Samsung EVO finde ich auch schneller und reaktionsfreudiger als eine SanDisk. SanDisk war in der Vergangenheit halt meist günstiger. Außer im Falle der SanDisk Extreme. Doch auch da hat die EVO immer einen Ticken die ""Nase vorn"".Warum nicht die maximale Punktzahl? Weil eine SATA-SSD nicht so schnell ist wie eine M.2 bzw. NVME-SSD. Andere Anschlussart, bringt noch mehr Performance. Dafür kann aber so gesehen die SSD nichts, auch nicht Samsung, sondern eher die Computer-Industrie, die immer wieder mit neuen Schnittstellen aufwartet.Ich empfehle die Samsung EVO gerne, wenn es um No-Nonsense, Spitzenperformance und vor allem Langlebigkeit geht. Wird man nicht bereuen, auch nicht nach jahrelanger Dauernutzung. Die EVO ist ein bisschen wie ein Panzer. Nahezu unzerstörbar, Samsung beziffert die maximalen Schreibwerte auf extreme TB-Mengen und das glaube ich gerne. Und man hat durch die SSD wieder einen guten, gangbaren Computer. Durch die neuen SSD-Schnittstellen sind die SATA-SSDs preislich sehr interessant und erschwinglich geworden. Daher zugreifen.', 'Eine Rezension von einer SSD. Was soll man da schon schreiben? Das Ding sieht aus wie alle anderen SSD\'s oder Festplatten im 2,5""-Format. Die größte Herausforderung besteht darin, den Computer zu öffnen, ohne dass einem der Schraubendreher auf das Logicboard fällt.Na ja, nicht ganz...Ich beschäftige mich fast ausschließlich mit Apple-Geräten, und da kann das öffnen und vorarbeiten zu der verbauten Festplatte von so einem iMac schon eine Herausforderung sein.Was gibt es also zu der zu Samsung 860 EVO zu rezensieren?Sie funktioniert! Das tun andere auch. Jetzt könnte man sich mit der eingesetzten Technologie, dem Speichercontroller oder der eingesetzten Speichertechnologie auseinandersetzen, aber das auch irgendwie Unsinn, da die meisten Leute kein Elektrotechnik-Studium absolviert haben, um zu verstehen, was da dann so geschrieben steht, und wie im Titel erwähnt, verschwindet so ein Bauteil unsichtbar im Computergehäuse und hat unauffällig seinen Dienst zu verrichten.Und genau das macht die Samsung EVO 860. Meine erste SSD war eine Samsung 830 PRO. Eine PRO deshalb, weil sie 10 Jahre Garantie hatte. Irgendwann bin ich dann aus Vernunftgründen auf die EVO 840, EVO 850 und nun die EVO 860 umgeschwenkt, weil 5 Jahre Garantie eigentlich ausreichen in so einem schnellen Markt, und auch ich kein Geld zu verschwenden habe. Dazu sollte man wissen, dass diese elektronischen Bauteile, bevor sie auf den Markt kommen, im Vorfeld über Stresstests mit permanenten Schreib/Lesen, Temperaturextremen und möglicherweise auch Erschütterungen an ihre Grenzen gebracht werden, um eine ""Endkundenlebensdauer"" zu errechnen. Also die durchschnittliche Lebensdauer des Bauteils beim Endkunden, die durchschnittliche Lebensdauer des Endkunden berechnet natürlich das Statistische Bundesamt. Diese Berechnungen werden von jedem Hersteller unter Ausschluss der Öffentlichkeit selbst berechnet. Da Samsung eine langjährige Erfahrung mit Speichermodulen hat, traue ich denen zu, die Lebensdauer so zu berechnen, das keine übermäßige Anzahl an Produkten zum Garantiefall wird.Und genau dass ist der Grund, warum ich eher zu dieser SSD greife als zu einem andere Hersteller, der seinen Produkten ""nur"" zwei oder drei Jahre Funktionstüchtigkeit zutraut.Allerdings muss man auch bei Samsung ein bisschen aufpassen, hier geht es um die 860 EVO SATA III 2,5 Zoll SSD mit der Artikelnummer MZ-76E1T0B/EU. Die hat 5 Jahre Garantie.Es gibt noch die ähnlich klingende 860 QVO SATA III 2,5"" SSD mit der Artikelnummer MZ-76Q1T0BW. Die hat nur 3 Jahre Garantie und wäre aus diesem Grund eher nichts für mich.', 'Works great after using free third party cloning software.

An m.2 SSD would have required my to step down in capacity and probably not go with Samsung's PRO version to stay in the same range.

‎B0827NHNNY,ineo M.2 NVMe (PCIe) SSD Enclosure Built-in Cooling Fan and Write Protection Switch [C2598-NVMe],Storage,S$80.22,https://www.amazon.sg/ineo-Enclosure-Cooling-Protection-C2598-NVMe/dp/B0827NHNNY/ref=sr_1_155?qid=1695814082&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051%2Cp_n_is-global-store-asin%3A6809457051%2Cp_36%3A5000-30000&rnid=6450031051&s=computers&sr=1-155,https://www.amazon.sg/ineo-Enclosure-Cooling-Protection-C2598-NVMe/product-reviews/B0827NHNNY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,4.4,"['Works well. Bought a second one', ""So this enclosure works really well reading SSD's with full speed via thunderbolt 4 port.  For most the fan is the biggest question.  From my experience the fan does work but if you dont expect it to drop the temps at all.  What it will do is once my SSD gets to about 50 degrees then the fan kicks on and IT STAYS THERE!  So it is not going to hit 50 then turn on the fan and then bring down the temp to low 40's or anything.  But the fan is very helpful as it will keep my external SSD from going higher then 50 degrees! Worth the purchase and glad I have it."", 'I have a fully-functional extra M.2 NVMe 1TB SSD drive left over from a ""warrantee repair"" that Dell did for my Precision 7510 laptop, so I thot it would be nice to convert it into an external drive for massive backups.  The Dell supports the full USB-C 3.x Thunderbolt spec, and has a port for it.Summary:  after assembly and finagled startup, the drive works GREAT ... I copied a folder that had 67.1 GB, in 77 folders and 13,237 files, in a bit less than 5 minutes.  Whee!  Try that with a typical USB stick, and you\'ll be waiting for an hour or two.I\'m impressed with the housing (see snapshot).  It is precision-machined metal, with deep fins for heat control ... important since if the SSD overheats, the transfer rate slows.  It is small but heavy ... weighs about the same as my iPhone 7+ with case.  My guess is that I could drive a car over it without damaging it.This beastie even has a (cool-looking) built in fan ... which didn\'t kick on during my initial tests (I\'m assuming that it\'s not broken ... I would have been concerned if it activated for the brief time I tested it).  There were NO other NVMe SSD housing options with a fan, and few with beefy fins.  This guy is definitely the best in that department.Another nifty feature is a tiny switch to the left of the blue light, which allows you to ""lock"" the drive so that it is Read-Only vs Read-Write.  Nice feature ... again, I didn\'t see it on other offerings.The connection-cord is ""universal"" ... for either USB-C (aka Thunderbolt) plug with rounded edges, or a traditional larger square-edged USB-A port.  Of course, the speed of the USB-A depends on the guts of the computer.  It\'s all one cable (handy) ... a small converter plug on the end converts from the cable\'s USB-A to a USB-C plug.  The snapshot shows it in place.A thoughtful feature is the inclusion of a drawstring bag that has plenty of room to hold the enclosure, the cable, and maybe a few extra typical-size USB sticks.  I like this attention to detail.ISSUES:  all minor but just sayin\' ...1. there are five teeny-tiny machine-screws provided ... one is a bit larger than the others. The ""large"" screw is used to hold the SSD in place when you press it down; the other four are used to attach the top to the bottom of the case.  I very nearly ordered a replacement, when I couldn\'t find the fifth ""large"" screw ... filled out the form, etc, then started to re-box it ... and behold! the screw came out of hiding.  Friendly Amazon agent on the phone cancelled the return for me.2. A screwdriver was provided ... and much to my pleasure, it was slightly magnetic at the tip, so it made it easy to ""grab"" the screws and get them positioned.  I didn\'t realize this at first ... the screws are way too tiny to pick up with fingers ... I had gotten out my tweezers to do it - then I noticed the screwdriver was magnetic.3. The ""instructions"" are minimal ... reasonable, since the install is really simple.  But it would have been nice if they mentioned the magnetic feature.  Also ... there is a ""silicon pad"" that they provide, to place between the top of the installed SSD, and the bottom of the big upper cover of the unit ... presumably to insulate the exposed traces on the SSD from the metal cover.  The instructions do NOT mention that you\'re supposed to peel off a clear strip from one side, so adhesive holds it in place on the SSD.4. Initial Operation was a bit bumpy.  I booted the PC, and then plugged in the drive.  Note that the PC already has another identical drive SSD as drive C, so I was 100% confident that it could ""read"" this new drive (as long as the enclosure was working).  I plugged it in to the USB-C Thunderbolt port, and opened Explorer.  At first, it didn\'t ""see"" the drive.  I jiggled the plugs a little ... I think, though, that Windows was just mulling it over a bit.5. When the drive (E) did finally appear in Explorer, a Windows popup suggested a scan of the drive.  I selected the default and it appeared to complete, with a ""1024"" (GB) on the pane.  However, when I tried to double-click open the drive, it said that it was not accessible.  I unplugged it and re-plugged it (no Eject option in the tray).  Still would not let me access.6. So, I left it plugged in, and rebooted the computer.  When I got back to Windows and checked the drive, it was fully accessible.  I did a couple of copies from PC>external, using big folders with lots of nesting.  Lickety-split!  Exactly what I was hoping for.  67.1 GB in less than 5 min!7. Then, while Windows was open, I used the taskbar ""Eject"" option (which did appear after the reboot) to disconnect the drive.  Then I plugged it back in.  Immediately, a popup asked me if I wanted to scan it ... I skipped that and immediately the Explorer window appeared.  Perfect.  Ejected it again.8. This time, I removed the USB-C adaptor, and plugged it in to one of the USB-A ports that I *think* supports full-speed 3.x protocol.  I deleted the 67.1 GB folder, and then re-copied it from the PC (using this alternate port).  Apparently the PC supported similar speed thru this port, since the copy again only took about 5 min.  Interesting note ... the PC\'s internal fan kicked on for a little while at this point (Xeon processor apparently working hard) ... but the external enclosure fan never did.9. OK, now I repeated step 8, once again deleting the folder, ejecting, and then plugging in the USB-A plug into the other side of the Dell, where (if I recall correctly) the three additional USB-A ports are more conventional non-Thunderbolt spec.  This is a three year old machine so I\'m not sure what USB level they are.  Certainly at least 2.x, maybe 3.0.  The tiny ""battery"" icon on the side of the unit seems to indicate the USB-A port on the left that I just disconnected from, might offer higher power output for devices that draw a lot of current.10. Once again, I copied the 67.1 GB folder.  Apparently the USB-A ports on the right edge are a leetle bit slower ... but still, the entire folder copied in just 6 minutes.  This would have taken well over an hour using a typical 256 GB flash drive.11.  Final test ... and the ONLY SURPRISE.  While the drive was connected, after the big folder was copied, I flipped the tiny ""lock"" switch on the enclosure, which is supposed to make the drive READ-ONLY.  After doing that, I tried copying a couple of files, and they DID copy without issues.  So ... you can\'t activate the write-blocking feature *while* the drive is plugged in.  When I tried to eject the drive (with the switch still ""locked""), it refused to authorize ejection until I turned the switch back to unlocked position.  Then it ejected just fine.12. This time, I turned the switch to lock *before* plugging it back in to the machine.  The Explorer window opened the same way.  When I tried to copy a couple of files, Windows told me the disk is write protected (as it should be).  And this time, when I used the Tray Eject feature, it worked fine (with switch in locked position).I hope this ""beat it to death"" review is helpful to enquiring minds.  I\'m VERY PLEASED with this product!', 'First and foremost, fantastic product. For that price, I did not expect that level of quality. It came wrapped in sealed plastic, and did not give me the impression it was thrown together. It had some weight to it and the packaging was very professional. the enclosure itself felt high quality and not flimsy or thrown together like other products I got in the past. So here are the pros and cons:Pros:Solid enclosure - it fits together perfectly, no gaps and all screw-holes lined up perfectlyComes with everything - It actually comes with the screwdriver, and even a thermal pad so your drive makes contact with the heat sync top.Quiet - seeing a fan, i was afraid it would be loud, but in reality, in a quiet room, I cant hear it right in-front of me.Fast - No issues with speed at all. Its quite fast even though USB3Appearance - It is a good looking enclosure without being hokey. No LEDs, no clear plastic, so it doesnt look like a cheap toy.Cons:The fan guard - this is the only con. The fan guard seems to have been over tightened during manufacturing, and caused the fan not to run. I had to remove the fan guard, flatten the waves in the fan guard, and reinstall it. Because this is affecting the functionality of the device, I had to give it 4 stars. If it was purely visual, I would not care. It was a simple 5 minute fix.Final thought:If you need an external enclosure, simply put, get this one. Its high quality, it cools the drive, and it.s fast. I have bought others, and dollar wise, this one just makes sense.  I have only been using it for a day and a half, if anything changes, I will update this review.', ""The case is solid. Weighty and well built.The case is fairly bulky, which I was hoping would mean it could fit a drive with a built-in heat sink. It does not. It wasn't hard to remove the factory heatsink from my old drive. The thermal tape that comes with the enclosure seems like it's going to be easy to remove and replace in the future if I need to swap drives.To open the case you need to unscrew 4 screws on the side. Not a big deal, but not something I would want if you're swapping drives regularly. Inserting the drive is like any M2 drive, lock the drive in with the provided screw and screwdriver, put the thermal tape on, close the case and screw it back together and it's good to go. You can run this with the top off, which may be helpful if you're troubleshooting drives or regularly swapping drives.I tested the drive speed and it meets USB 3.2 spec for data transfer speeds. The amount of fins and the fan keep the drive cool. The fan only comes on at a certain temp, so it's off most of the time unless you're doing some heavy writing and reading from the drive."", 'I am using it with a WB black 1 TB M. 2 SSD. It works perfectly on my Windows 11 laptop, desktop, Andriod smartphone and tablet. I also use it on my Andriod TV box and projector. Works w/o any issues! Highly recommended!', ""The overall design of the device is appealing, but my unboxing experience was marred by a non-functional fan, which, upon further testing, seemed to stem from a PCB board issue. Adding to the frustration, the USB interface failed to initialize the disk as expected. However, Amazon's excellent customer service swiftly processed a return and refund. While I admire the design, it's clear that quality assurance might be lacking. I'm considering re-ordering to test another unit in the hopes that this was just an unfortunate exception."", 'I recently bought a sabrent that works fine but would get very hot when used extensively and would cause the drive to stall. This one seem to solve the problem so far. Haven’t been having the issue since', ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0I bought this device to insert a Samsung 970 Evo Plus 2TB NVMe M.2 SSD into so I could make my own faster portable hard drive.  We have a HP desktop from 2009 that originally had Windows Vista on it.  I installed Windows 7 on a SSD drive blowing away Windows Vista and it has been limping along with some older SSD drives since.  The machine is starting to really drag when we power it on so I wanted this device to backup about 0.7TB worth of digital photos and videos before we wipe the machine and donate it.  After inserting the Samsung chip at an angle, then adding the spacer below and screwing it in I removed the plastic on both sides of the thermal strip and put it on top of the NVMe chip.  This strip causes the top of enclosure to stick out so I had to press down in order to get the four screw holes to align.  The included magnetic screw driver is really helpful for unscrewing and screwing in all of the screws.I booted up my laptop using the USB-C cable and no device was recognized in the Control Panel->Device Manager.  I was using a Dell laptop so I ensured I installed all the latest updates and rebooted with the other USB cable.  This time Device Manager detected the hard drive.  After that, I opened Disk Manager and got a pop up for the new drive.  Click OK then choose GPT to create the new volume.  Quick format and then you get about 1.81TB of usable space (NTFS format).  The backup from my old PC (using first generation USB ports?) is taking about 2 hours to copy 0.7TB worth of data at around 29MB/s.  I'm looking forward to seeing how fast I can backup my latest round of photos and videos to my laptop.I haven't heard the fan come on yet.  The device is resting on a granite slab of my built in desk in my office.  The slab is always cold even in the summer so I wonder if I'll ever hear the fan turn on.It takes a few seconds to copy 2GB from this device to a laptop using the supplied USB C to USB C cable.  100GB will copy in two minutes.  This is fast enough for me.  Storage keeps doubling and getting cheaper.  By the time I run out of 2TB, I hope to buy double the size and hopefully there will be a newer enclosure that supports faster speeds."", ""This unit is very well built... nice thick heatsink with a quite fan. I'm using this for my car stereo cause its so sturdy.""]"

The websites reviewing this product were reporting 3300 MB/S read,  2600 MB/s write.  That's a fairly big difference.  I'm hoping Mushkin has an updated firmware or something.The Ugly:  To make matters worse, this product isn't even listed on the manufacturer's website.  I've opened up a support ticket with the manufacturer to see how they'll respond, maybe they'll have an updated firmware.  I'll report what happens here.Other Words:  In the meantime, if you want an SM2262EN-based NVME SSD, I would recommend the HP EX950 or the ADATA XPG SX8200 pro.Edit:  I'm revising my review to 5-stars.  Mushkin got back to me within a few hours of my creating a support case.  The person who responded was knowledgeable and assisted me troubleshooting the drive's  slowness.  It turns out it was my laptop, a Dell XPS 15 9570 having strange issues with this drive (strange issues in general).  When I re-tested the drive on my desktop Z270 chipset system, the scores were well within expectation.  I was getting 3300+MB/S read and 2800+MB/S write."", ""So far the drive is working one day in.  ease of install would be five star but it doesn't come with the screw. of course I have a ton laying around.  Just a heads up for those who don't.Didn't do any speed tests.  Didn't buy it for the speed, bought it for the saved space in a laptop.  SATA6 vs. NVME speed difference isn't noticeable at all unless you are doing large IO (more than gaming or day to day use) .. but the smaller foot print is worth the few extra bucks."", ""I just used this to upgrade the SSD in a new Lenovo P53s. A note on why CDM only shows partial capacity:  it was partitioned-- (Lenovo sales swore up and down the P53s model I bought had dual SSD drives.  Of course when I opened it up expecting to pop the Pilot-E in an empty slot, there was only one which was almost full due to migrated stuff from my previous computer, and also had the OS on it..)  I had to use macrium, recovery usb and an external HD to get the image on there.  What a PITA. I was just trying to get this thing working because school starts for me in a few days. (Mind you, I was upgrading from a 6 year old tank of a T530 with an Ivy Bridge which did everything I needed it to do, albeit....... ...slowly.)Anyway, I digress... this SSD works as advertised (fast!) and is incredibly inexpensive.  I've used Mushkin memory before many years ago with great results, which is why I didn't hesitate to buy this SSD.  What a steal!"", 'This NVMe works rather well. Not too sure if it was meant to be any faster than a regular SSD, but this has the same boot time as my WD Blue 1TB SSD.The NVMe is easy to install, installed on an Asrock B365 Pro4 motherboard.Would I get this again? Yes, I would. Especially at its lower price than other 1TB NVMe are.Finally bought a 2nd one so I can clone Win10 from the original. Still have no issues with the first one that I previously bought. And so far there has been no issues with this 2nd one.', 'Packaging was too thin and amazon just sends all of these SSDs in small, lightly padded Amazon envelopes, so something clearly crushed the packaging. The drive APPEARED fine, so I tried installing it. BIOS error message appeared.Also, FYI: this is a double-sided SSD, meaning that there are components in both sides, making it thicker. So if it’s a tight squeeze you’re looking for, for example: on a laptop motherboard where there’s already a thick thermal pad, it may be an uncomfortable fit. I sent it back because it didn’t work, probably because it was damaged in the mail and I went ahead and bought a Samsung 970 EVO Pro instead because I don’t really need encryption and because it’s a single-sided SSD and fits better in my laptop.I can’t say anything about drive performance or life because mine was DOA, but the manufacturer should be made aware that Amazon doesn’t box these and they can be damaged in shipping, therefore they need a more durable case. My Samsung SSD came in an envelope as well, but the product was in its own small box with a hard plastic shell protecting it.Rating it 3 stars because I don’t want to punish the company, but I want them to know about this and improve.', ""I'm glad I did this purchase.I recently bought a laptop that came with a 128GB m.2 drive and I was sick of running out of memory just with the windows installation.

I really wanted the EVO because Samsung is a brand I like, but when I realized its best features didn't apply to my use case I moved over to this.

I didn't care for that, and wanted the OS separate and on fast SSDs. I'd notice a considerable slow down in the Plex interface because of the database running on the RAID group rather than an SSD. I could have gotten an expansion enclosure and installed SSDs in there....  That would have been a more expensive and space consuming option. Sort of would defeat the purpose of buying the QNAP, so I decided to go this route.If you look at the QNAP site, it say the TS-453be is compatible with a large number of QM2 M.2 Expansion cards. You have to look closely to understand the differences in them. They're basically just SATA vs NVMe m.2 support and then the version + number of PCIE channels. I chose the QM2-2P-244A because that's all the faster the TS-453be could support. Getting a faster card would have wasted even more money... I wanted to get a non-QNAP card, but found out that QTS doesn't necessarily allow third-party cards to use SSDs for the same types of storage devices. Rather than risk I couldn't put the OS on it, I splurged for the QNAP card.Before installing I made sure to backup all my settings in QTS and my Plex database/config (that's really all I'm using right now). Installation was a breeze. Just a couple screws in the chassis and it slides apart. Installing the m.2 drives was interesting because you have to put spacers on the board to make sure the chips have good contact with the heatsink. Before starting it up, I pulled all my data drives out of the enclosure. The QNAP then had to be set up just like it was new. However, when I was done the OS and Apps were running from the SSDs.The SSDs I'm running are:Silicon Power 512GB NVMe M.2 2280 PCIe Gen3 x4 TLC SSDTeam Group MP33 M.2 2280 512GB PCIe 3.0 x4 with NVMe 1.3 3D NANDNeither of these drives is listed on the QNAP website as supported, and if you read QNAP's info they give a big warning about making sure they listed the SSD as supported. However, these work perfectly fine. I'm having no issues with them at all. I chose them because they were the cheapest at the time (and actually had better warranties than a lot of the bigger brands), they have high MTBF, and use different memory chips. Figured out after ordering they use the same controller chip...  I was trying to get 2 identically sized drives that used different memory chips and controllers so that RAID 1 made sense to use. Two identical SSDs in RAID 1 does make some sense, but since SSDs aren't mechanical drives they'll probably die at the same time so it's better to go with different drives (not the case for other RAID levels).The interesting thing about running this way was when I put my data drives back in. QTS scans the drives for volumes and then makes duplicate shares for them. It's kind of a mess to clean up, but it's easier if you just create new shares, transfer your data into those, and then delete the old ones. After lots of trial and error I ended up creating symbolic links so the new share locations just pointed back to the old ones. This allowed all the locks, logs, and caching to remain on the SSDs.Running with Plex on the SSDs has made a world of difference...  The pictures load so much faster now. It's back to like it's running on my more powerful desktop again.After all that I found out that Synology has a NAS nearly identical to the TS-453be but with 2x M.2 slots built-in (and accessible without disassembly). It hadn't shown up in my capabilities search when I was selecting a NAS box, so I didn't even consider before. It's more expensive than the QNAP, but after adding the QM2 card it wasn't...  Sorry I don't remember the model number of it, but just a fair warning if you're considering the TS-453."", ""Reviewing QNAP QM2-4P-342 - a quad PCIe X4 card.There are a number of excellent reviews for those cards, the main attractive point for the cards is that they do not require PCIe bifurcation (the chipset would present X16 slot as 4 X4 slots).There is a missing point in many reviews, specifically the difference in the design and consequently performance of 2 SSDs variants vs 4 SSDs cards.While 2 SSD cards are designed as a multiplexer, providing X4 slot to either of SSD on the card, the 4 SSDs variant divides X4 slot and dedicates 2 lines for each pair of SSDs multiplexing between them (the reference design diagram can be found on QNAP website).Consequently, the sequential reads and writes suffer and are limited by 2 PCIe lines bandwidth. In my tests Samsung SSDs capable of delivering 3400mb/s sequential  read/write in a single SSD adapter, would drop to 1600mb/s when placed in the Quad card in an X4 pcie slot.The random 4k read/write does not seem to be affected at all, likely due to less bus bandwidth dependency (they top at 200 mb/s).In the majority real world use-cases sequential reads/writes are rare, so it's a good compromise for most applications, the card can still deliver 4 ssds in a single X4 slot, providing significantly better random read/write in compare to HDD - certainly improving gaming experience.For anything requiring top sequential read/write the card is not the best choice.Lastly, many data center SSDs and Optane SSDs are of 22110 length and do not fit in the Quad card."", ""I had an older QNAP TVS671 NAS with an i3 CPU that I had previously replaced with a new model. I decided to undertake an upgrade path and ultimately replaced the i3 CPU with an i7 (not a trivial task). While this amped up the performance substantially, I also decided to move from QNAP QTS to Open Mediavault (OMV) and add a M.2 NVME SSD to up the performance further.I researched a variety of PCIe M.2 adapter cards but ultimately settled on this official QNAP product. It installs very easily and has room for two M.2 SSD's. Unfortunately the older BIOS does not allow me to boot OMV from the SSD. I use the SSD primarily for app and docker storage and leave the HDD's for data.My understanding is that you can install QTS to the SSD upon a clean (new) install of QTS but I have not tested this.Other than a higher price than other PCIe M.2 adapters, this card works perfectly in my QNAP TVS671 NAS and I would recommend it for a trouble free experience."", 'Works as it should.

There are no observable performance penalties in single SSD configuration compared to a passive single slot PCIe SSD adapter. These QNAP adapters are essentially an Aplicata Quad M.2 NVMe SSD PCIe x8 Adapter (B01MTU75X4) with 2 slots. If you're looking for a quad m.2 adapter, the QM2-4P-384A (B07CVGZZCT) should be comparable with the Aplicata in terms of functionality and performance.SSDs run ~8°C cooler compared to no heatsink/fan. The heatsink is quite beefy and appears to be made of pure copper. Unfortunately, more than half the airflow coming from the fan is escaping through the sides and end of the card. I will need to 3D print a fan shroud to redirect all the airflow along the length of the card. This will be for a future project when I have time.There is a performance drop in 4k synthetic benchmarks when both SSDs are being accessed at the same time. This appears to be a limitation of the PLX bridge chip. I have observed this on multiple systems with different SSDs. Perhaps someone can shed some light on this phenomenon?Overall, I would recommend this card to anyone looking for a multi-m.2 PCIe SSD adapter. This card is for anyone that requires additional m.2 PCIe SSD slots on a motherboard that does not support PCIe bifurcation.

Such a switch would be relatively expensive because it needs to manage a total of 20 lanes, 16 ""guest"" + 4 ""host"".A *cheapo* switch allows each ""guest"" device/drive only so much bandwidth that all guests cannot overflow the host connection. Here it would be 1 lane for each of the four guests, 4 host and 4 guest lanes and a total of 8 lanes with no oversubscription at all.If you were to connect very distinct devices such as GPU, network and storage via a PCIe switch, a ""perfect"" switch makes a lot of sense. But if all you connect is storage the returns for ""perfection"" diminish quickly, especially if your NVMe drives were to be fully present and striped as a RAID0: in that case ""perfect"" and ""cheapo"" would offer nearly the same performance as the ""switching"" would be largely moved to the storage blocks themselves, at least for large sequential I/O. For random I/O the perfect switch could still offer significant speedups.This card uses the ASMedia ASM2812 PCIe switch chip, which targets the compromise between *perfect* and *cheapo* using 12 lanes, 4 to the host and 8 to the guests.Actually the chip would be ""perfect"" if there was only 2 NVMe x4 guests. And it would be more ""cheapo"", if you were to use it with the maximum of six guests it supports.The chip itself is flexible, but actual lane allocations to guests need to be etched as traces into the board and in this case each of the four M.2 connectors gets two lanes, limiting the maximum bandwidth for each NVMe drive to 2GByte/s and resulting in an oversubscription of 2:1 which means that the aggregate guest bandwidth is twice the host bandwidth.I obviously would have preferred a ""perfect"" switch, especially since there are a lot more devices you can mount to M.2 connectors than just NVMe drives. I don\'t know how much more an ASM2824 would have cost, but it seems nobody is selling a 4:1 oversubscription x4 board today, so this one better fill your needs as I have not found any alternative.I don\'t know for how long this adapter has been available, but a year ago it would have been a real killer as NVMe drives with more than 2TB capacity and faster than PCIe v3 speeds were prohibitive in price.Today (Q2 2023) with pricing becoming linear at least up to 4TB and PCIe v4 becoming only a slight premium on v3 prices, it might just have missed the boat: you\'d really want a PCIe v5 host port and full 4 lanes to each NVMe drive. Yes you can recycle lower capacity NVMe drives that are still good into a higher capacity one that fits into an x4 slot you have no use for otherwise. But €150 also buy you around 3TB of NVME v3 storage or 2TB of NVMe v4 storage... YMMVI do like the fact that they are using the same screws to mount heatsink and the NVMe drives, and that they give you two extra ones and a screw driver: those screws are easy to loose and hard to get so it seems that practical product advice has gone into the design. It\'s single slot, no sharp corners etc.I am not sure I like the fact that the heatsink is so massive. If your system is portable or gets moved around, the risk of slot damage from the sheer weight is quite real as there is no back-bracket mounting option like you have with today\'s massive GPUs. It\'s probably better in an ITX or desktop case mounted upright, but sideways in a tower case you need to pay attention to its weight.Most PCIe v3 NVMe drives may not need that much cooling or trade power consumption with slightly lower performance. The switch chip may be another matter. I couldn\'t get specs on the power usage but in theory it could draw 25 Watts and that certainly would explain why the heatsink is so massive. It would also mean that using the board say for four 6 port SATA M.2 boards (also with ASmedia chips), a near perfect match otherwise, would be out of the question.It\'s ok not to hit customers with tons of detail technical data up front. But please do ensure that technical background material is at least available via links or somewhat deeper down.Having to buy such a board and then potentially returning it, because it\'s only physically testing which allows you to obtain all the information you need, doesn\'t do good for your customers nor for you as a company.', ""Currently using in a Dell Optiplex which does not have mboard bifurcation and all 4 nvme SSDs are seen and function without any noticeable issues after about 3 months of NAS use. Decided not to use the heatsink that came with it due to the weight since I'm using other thermal mitigation, so can't comment on use with any nvmes other than gen 3, but I would expect gen 4/5 to need the heatsink which would affect the position the box needs to reside in to avoid the weight pulling the card out of the slot."", ""Bought this as my motherboard didn't support bifurcation and works a treat. I can't tell you what full speed would be but I have 4 nvme drives in software raid 5 using truenas. Works perfectly so far and can saturate 10gbe connection giving 1gb second read / write."", 'I’m truly happy with this card. I put myself in a pickle when I purchased the AORUS GeForce RTX 4090 Masters. This video card was so large I had to move the ASUS Hyper M.2 card to the 3rd PCIe X16 slot on the ROG Stix X-299-E Gaming II that is wired as an 8X socket. I lost 2 drives and was unable to access my RAID drives in Microsoft Storage Spaces. I install this card and wouldn’t you know it, I recovered the 2 missing drives and I’m back to work. As far as speed is concern it didn’t matter to me as I was only using the Hyper M.2 card as a back to DaVinci Resolve. All I can add is that I backed up three different project and I couldn’t see any difference in time, but If speed is an issue this card is not for you. I highly recommend this card as a storage device.', 'Do you have a computer with an unused PCIe X4 slot? Need more cheap(ish), fast(ish) disk space? This is a good solution that does not require PCIe bifurcation; there\'s an ASMedia PCIe Switch on the card. The downside is that the ASMedia switch can only provide 2 PCIe lanes to each NVME drive. If you\'re looking for blazing fast NVME, look elsewhere. If you\'re looking for ~1500 MB/s speeds (PCIe 3x2) with inexpensive NVME drives, this is the card for you.If you know the limitations of this card and can work with them, it\'s a fantastic value.The Good:- Puts that extra PCIe x4 slot you have to use (Verify that your motherboard doesn\'t disable it when you populate all the motherboard NVME slots and other weirdness).- Adds 4x PCIe 3x2 NVME slots- Bifurcation not required.- Drivers not required.- Heavy aluminum heatsink looks good.The Bad:- No SATA drive support.

This one is a Sata and so it will be slower than a typical NVMe drive.  That doesn't mean you can't use it though, and it will still work decently, but the fastest drive is the NVMe drive so you might want to think about that.  Of course double check that your system can handle an NVMe drive before you buy one.  If you have an M key slot and no B key, then most likely it can handle an NVMe drive.  The M key is on the right side when holding the drive such that the connector pins are up and viewing from the top of the drive, and the M key is on the left side.  If you have any doubts, look it up on the internet.Second, physically installing the drive is pretty easy.  You do have to be able to handle a tiny screw though so you can screw it down when you put the new drive in.  There's only one screw though so it's not too difficult.Third, Installing the Windows 11 operating system CAN be very simple too, if you follow these suggestions.Before you install your new drive make a Recovery Drive with Windows 11.  You can find out how to do this on the web, and it's not hard to do.  It may take a while to make it, but you don't have to do anything while it is being made.  It could take up to two and a half hours to finish because it stores all the vital information on a thumb drive.  The thumb drive you need will be 16GB or larger, and it will erase all the data on it before it makes the Recovery Drive.  Actually, it is best to make the Recovery Drive before you need a new hard drive because if your hard drive goes you cannot very well make one.Once you make the Recovery Drive it becomes very simple and easy to reinstall your operating system, and it will activate automatically when you are finished installing and connect to the internet for the first time.  Once you get the drive in physically, you can push the Recovery Drive into a USB port and boot up.  The machine will boot to the Recovery Drive or you may have to press the key F7.  After that you just follow the simple instructions and it will start the installation.  It does not take very long to complete, then you start to type in your information and choose a password.  After a short time you get the new desktop and you can then go on to use the computer the way you normally would.

However, at a cheap price for a 256GB SSD let alone one that will work with macOS (which adds a premium price like OCW’s Mac SSD at $90 256GB). Personally would of preferred a Samsung SSD at over 2000MB/s read/write but the hassle of trying to get it to work (and might not) isn’t worth it. My stock 128GB (13” Mid 2014 MacBook Pro) had around 700-800MB/s read/write and this product is around 1100-1200MB/s read/write so a nice upgrade in speed. My SSD died after 7years of use (Samsung SSD - first gen of M.2 and any of them run hot so even a decent brand will die fast due to heat of the controller IC) and it was nice to read the instructions which implied macOS is preloaded on the SSD so install it, do the macOS setup process of clicking next on a few screens and was done. That is very nice vs having to have a 2nd Mac make a USB bootable usb drive which I didn’t have. Therefore, cheap price, decent speed/size upgrade to my supported model, stupid simple install makes me give it 5stars. As long as it can last 5years (doubt I’ll use it more then a few years since apple stopped updates which is stupid as the CPU is still fast, great screen, ac WiFi, SSD, etc no reason it can’t be a good PC for 5 more years - but could switch to windows once my browsers stop updating due to an old macOS as a lot of sites won’t work on outdated browsers) it is good value for the money.', 'This was by far the easiest hard drive upgrade I’ve ever done to the Mac.

Working well', 'I decided to switch to this brand of SSD after having the same PANIC NVMe issues with the OWC Aura Pro as others have mentioned in their reviews.  I would like to add that it\'s nice the two screwdrivers needed to remove the MacBook Pro cover and T5 screw on the motherboard are included with the drive.  I\'ll do a follow up review in a few weeks after observing performance and general use.I would like to comment on how others have mentioned they can\'t use this SSD out of the box or do a Time Machine restore and they only method to get this SSD functional is to clone the original volume. While cloning one volume to the other is ONE effective solution.  I would like to offer another solution that DOESN\'T require cloning and will allow you to restore your macOS Time Machine Backup.  First off, it\'s important to note fresh drives from the manufacturer are not formatted and do not have any sort of partition scheme. Hence, why you can\'t just place this SSD in your MacBook and boot it up and expect it to work.  The macOS recovery partition would need to be installed in order to get any boot options and since this drive out of the box is bare, I will walk you through the steps I took to get it to a functional state and a successful Time Machine restore.Step 1) You\'ll need to create a flash boot drive with the applicable macOS install files.  There are two methods for doing so: A) Download the ""Diskmaker X"" Application, which is a GUI interface for creating a bootable USB flash drive with the macOS install files.B) If you comfortable using the terminal command line, there\'s a simple one line command you can copy and paste from the following Apple Support article: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372** It\'s important to note, you must download the ""installer file"" from the App Store onto your machine in order for this to work.  And once a previous macOS version is no longer supported, you will have a hard time finding it on the App Store since Apple will remove it.Once you have your macOS Bootable USB Flash drive created, you are ready to proceed with the next step.Step 2) Provided you have installed the new SSD in your MacBook, you can now boot up your MacBook with the bootable USB drive also inserted into a USB port.  Power on your MacBook and once you hear the Apple boot chime, press and hold the ""option"" key which will bring up a prompt to allow you to boot from the USB flash drive.  You should see an icon with the application macOS version (i.e. Install macOS Mojave).  It will take a few moments to load the applicable installation files and then launch the macOS utilities menu.  Important!: You will first need to prep your drive with Disk Utility.Step 3) Open Disk Utility app. By default, Disk Utility only lists Volumes. You will want to see all devices by selecting View on the upper menu bar and select ""Show all Devices"". This will now display the hardware ID for the SSD ""TS480GJDM850 Media"" in the left column.  Highlight this hardware by selecting it and then click the ""Erase"" button. You will then be prompted to give the SSD a name (i.e. Mac SSD), select the macOS partition type (Mac OS Extended Journaled) and change the Scheme from Boot Record to GUID Partition Map. Click Erase.  After a few minutes this should prep the SSD for installation of the macOS. When complete, exit Disk Utility.Step 4) You are now ready to install the macOS Operating System. Select ""install macOS"", review the licensing agreements and proceed. You should be able to select your newly formatted and prepared SSD drive.After a while, the base operating system files will be installed on the SSD and you will have an option at that point to restore your files from time machine.  There is an option to restore from Time Machine from the Utilities Menu at the completion of Step 3 above, but I elected to install fresh new operating system files first. Simply technique.Step 5) Your Time Machine files will be restored from backup after several hours and you should be good to go at that point!Hope this new information helps others.', 'Die SSD läuft in meinem MBA 11"" Early 15 unter macOS 10.12 einwandfrei und schnell. Die bei Transcend und anderen SSD-Anbietern (auch Konfigurationen MIT Adapter) aufgeführten Hinweise, dass mind. 10.13 laufen muss, stimmen so nicht. Es ist so, dass neuere Versionen von macOS den Boot-ROM automatisch flashen und auf eine neuere Version bringen. Somit langt es, wenn einmalig eine Version größer gleich 10.13 installiert war. Danach kann man alles ab 10.8 installieren (da gabs erst eine anständige SSD-Unterstützung), soweit der Mac abwärtskompatibel ist. Das kostenlose Programm MacTracker hilft sehr gut.

It arrived very promptly, and was very easy to physically install. However, as many of the other reviews have indicated, the problems start when you try and get the Mac to recognise the new SSD drive.  the instructions that come with the drive are extremely basic, and really are no help at all. Even on the transcend website there is not much to help you load the new drive. The first thing that has to be done is that you must be running OS high Sierra for the Mac to recognise the new  Drive. the Jetdrive 850 has to be formatted for the Mac. Once you have physically installed the drive, you have to restart the computer holding down the 'option' key. This will allow you to reboot from a Time Machine backup. In order to reformat the new SSD drive go into disk utilities and click on the 'view' menu and select 'show all devices'. Then select the Transcend Jetdrive. Select 'erase'  and you get options of how you want it formatted. You can then select 'Mac OS extended (journaled)'. and select 'GUID' in the other option box. Then you erase the disc and it will reformat to suit the Time Machine backup or reinstalling from OS from the Internet. I did not need to use anything other than Time Machine, such as SuperDuper, or clone the system. It is just the hassle of getting the new disk formatted that is the problem.This worked for me on a 2015 MacBook Air and it seems to be working fine, giving me my MacBook Air  a new lease of life. However if I had had to rely on the Transcend technical support I would still be waiting now. I contacted them on three occasions and no one ever got back to me. One tip that I did discover is that there is a telephone number for UK technical support at Transcend on  (01442) 202880, so you could try that as a last resort if you're really having trouble.I would probably advise buying the Jetdrive 855 which comes with an enclosure, which allows the new disk to be formatted before removing the existing drive, and of course allows for the old drive to be used as an additional external drive once the new one is in place."", ""I bought this item to replace the original MacBook SSD which was broken, so for MacBook Pro mid-2015, A1502 is not working, and mac can't recognize the Transend SSD.

Whilst reasonably technically literate, it was with some trepidation that I decided to go down this route and open up the innards of the laptop rather than just head to an Apple specialist (and pay double)...This was overall rather painless, and far quicker than I anticipated.  Having read a number of slightly conflicting approaches on various websites, the following worked for me:- Formatting the new SSD using the standard IOS Disk Utility. 5 mins.- Installing Carbon Copy Cloner (Free trial) and copying all content across to new SSD. Took about an hour.- Following the useful YouTube guide by Tech Critter- “How to upgrade Mac SSD feat. Transcend Jetdrive 855” to check the SSD had indeed copied across and for the physical swapping of the new SSD from the enclosure into the MacBook Air (another 20 mins, but would only take 5 if you know what you’re doing!)Afterwards, a number of apps (Microsoft Office, Dropbox, Apple Cloud) needed re-registering etc.Whilst I’ve not run any benchmarks, even with the cheaper Transcend 825 rather than Transcend 855, I’ve noticed a speed improvement.All great, and I’ve now got over200gb of breathing space!', ""I ordered this with the Thunderbolt 2 enclosure. The SSD drive came pre-mounted inside the enclosure I could simply connect it to my Mac and clone the internal drive to it (I used SuperDuper 'Backup - all files' to do so). Then I simply took the drive out of the case and swapped it with the internal drive. The MacBook then booted from the new internal drive and I was up and running just as before but with additional free space!Some comments:1. While transcend includes a small leaflet with instructions for installing the drive, I strongly suggest looking at the iFixit walkthrough with screenshots.2. The default format of the disk is exFat. You'd probably want to reformat it to HPFS or APFS. If you'd like to use FireVault encryption, I suggest you first repartition it using the GUID Partition Scheme (the default scheme is MBR that doesn't work with FireVault encryption).3. Once you've taken out your old disk and put it inside the enclosure, you can boot into it while holding down the Option key and selecting the drive (usually shown as orange hard disc icon) when your Mac restarts - just in case you ever need it again.4. The transfer speed when connected over Thunderbolt 2 was quite good (I sustained around 200 MB/s averaged over 45-50 minutes while cloning my 512 GB internal disk to it).5. The enclosure is made of thick aluminium. It does get quite warm when transferring a lot of data. I guess the aluminium case helps dissipate the heat.6.

Versucht man eine Windows Installation mit dem Sintech-Adapter gelingt das zwar zunächst, jedoch generiert das später im Betrieb ständig einen Bluscreen. Wahrscheinlich gibt es keinen (noch keinen) funktionierenden Win Treiber von Apple für diesen Adapter im MacBook.Für die User, die Windows parallel nutzen möchten fällt diese Variante damit praktisch aus. Daher gibt es für diese Usergruppe nur die Alternative Transcend JetDrive. Zum Thema Akkulaufzeit mit der Transcend 480GB JetDrive kann ich aus Erfahrung berichten: Ja. Es gibt einen kleinen Nachteil in der Laufzeit, jedoch nur unter Mac OS. Ich hatte zum Test einen Film jeweils 60 Min. mit der Apple original verbauten Toshiba SSD und mit der Transcend 480GB JetDrive verglichen.Der Unterschied war relativ gering. Nach 60 min.

Abspielzeit noch 72% Restlaufzeit.Bei derselben Abspielzeit unter Win auf dem Macbook lagen beide SSDs bei exakt 72% Restlaufzeit.Die Zugriffszeiten finde ich aus meiner persönlichen Sicht erstaunlich gut. Beim Entpacken einer Zip Datei 5GB hat die Transcend 480GB JetDrive 48Sek benötigt im MacBook unter Windows. Eine EVO960 im Intel PC benötigte hier 23sek.

There are very easy to follow videos online, but the only tip is to make sure that you do not try to angle the drive in, but slide the old one out vertically and drop the new one in vertically as well.Within a couple of minutes I had the Mac Pro back up and running and booted it holding down the Option key, which allowed it to connect to the Internet and automatically started the download of the original operating system that came with the Mac Pro (in my case, Yosemite). It would also have been a snap to boot it with a USB external drive and install an OS from backup if so desired.At this stage, I cannot comment on the long-term quality of the drive, but in terms of an instant on replacement for the original drive, I have to say that it is excellent, and I am very pleased with it."", 'Excellent SSD which made my 2015 MacBook pro even quicker with start up to ready in around 30 seconds.

I didn\'t get the case along with it, bit pricey to reuse the old 128GB chip as an external drive (with that extra £70 I could get a 2TB external drive with ease). Recommend two prerequisites: 1. Make sure to have a completed Time Machine backup; 2. Make a bootable macOS installation disk on a USB stick (need at least 16GB - can find instruction on Apple\'s support site - make sure it\'s the same version as the macOS currently installed on the old drive). Changing of the drives is straightforward, tools are included in the box. Once upgraded, boot the MacBook up with the USB stick into recovery mode, format the new drive (make sure to change the bootable sector to GUID partition map - click ""View"" dropdown on top left of Disk Utility), install a fresh copy of the macOS on the new drive first to make sure the new drive is bootable.

It works GREAT.  It is fast -- I did a sequential bit-for-bit transfer from my factory SSD to this over USB3 using ddrescue & System Rescue CD, and did ~450MB/s of writes to it practically the whole time; the copy was done in minutes! -- and TRIM is working on both OS X (trimforce) and Windows.  I have experienced no weird slowdowns or issues with power management or sleep/wake.  Everything is as it was before, except I now have way more storage!I also love that the kit comes with everything you need to migrate over to the new drive, including screwdrivers and a very nice aluminum USB3 enclosure for your old drive that you can continue to use as an external drive after you have finished your boot drive migration.  Given how relatively spendy this drive is, a 5-year warranty puts me at ease, as does the fact that I know Transcend is a trustworthy brand that has been around for a while, so I\'m pretty sure they aren\'t going anywhere and will still be around should I need help during those 5 years.  Since there are now cheaper, alternative solutions for MacBooks with SATA-based flash storage, such as M.2/NGFF adapters and super-inexpensive standard M.2 SATA flash modules, these are important factors to take into account when weighing one\'s options.  For an aging 2010 MacBook Air that I have whose internal storage I also needed to increase, I went the cheaper route, and that has been going fine... surprisingly well, even.  But for my primary workhorse computer, the Pro, I think that I made the right choice to spend a little extra money to get something specifically built and tested for this machine, for that little extra peace of mind.The only thing I\'m still on the fence about is the software that Transcend provides to monitor the health of the disk.  It\'s very basic, which is fine, perhaps even desirable.  But given how basic it is, and with no explanation of the purpose for them or the benefits they offer, it makes no sense that when you launch it, it insists on installing a handful of ""Privileged Helper Tools.""  The names suggest that they may help with power save / sleep issues, but without those installed, I have zero issues, and even if there were issues, there should be no need to take care of that sort of thing in software...if there are problems, that should be addressed in firmware, not with privileged system extensions.  So I take care to launch JetDrive Toolbox very rarely and immediately remove these extensions after closing it.  It\'s possible that these helper tools are specifically made for the JetDrive Lite SD cards that Transcend also makes, but I\'m not using one of those, so they shouldn\'t force me to install these extensions whenever I run their Toolbox.Finally, I\'ll mention that I bought the 720 model instead of the 725 even though I have a 15"" rMBP.  I knew I was taking a risk, but the 720 happened to be on sale at the time I made the purchase, and as a result I saved a significant enough chunk of cash that the potential savings outweighed any risk that it wouldn\'t work and I\'d have to return it (which I determined was fairly minor after doing some research).  Given the fact that Apple uses the *same* OEM part #s for SSDs between the 13"" and 15"" models from 2012 through early 2013, that Transcend offers two different sets of SKUs for 13"" and 15"" models made absolutely no sense to me when I first started looking into the product.  As other reviewers here point out, it turns out that Transcend originally also only offered one part for both 13"" and 15"" models as well -- the 720 -- but the 720 was half-a-millimeter longer than the official Apple part, which apparently was a problem for a small subset of the 15"" rMBPs that Apple shipped, where manufacturing tolerances for the space that the SSD fits in allowed for a variance of that much room!  So Transcend re-designed the PCB to shave off that extra 0.5mm so that it would fit in *all* 15"" rMBPs and released the updated version as the 725.  When they originally communicated about this issue, they strongly implied that the 725 would *replace* the 720, since there is no reason that the 725 wouldn\'t also fit just fine in the 13"" model.  Instead, for reasons that I cannot fathom, they still sell the 720 and 725 side-by-side, and label the 720 as exclusively for the 13"" and the 725 as exclusively for the 15"".  Boggles the mind.  And it\'s definitely not the case that remaining 720s in the retail channel are just old-stock, because the solution to this problem (the 725) was released in 2014, and I can tell you that my particular 720 stick was manufactured in April of this year.  I have to believe at this point that 720 sticks manufactured after the release of the 725 are actually identical to the 725 in every way (because why continue to manufacture and stock two subtly different products that are otherwise identical in every other way?), and my best guess is that Transcend just figured it was easier to continue to sell both, since older 720s in circulation may or may not fit in a given 15"" rMBP, so this just reduces confusion in certain circumstances (but, as you can see, increases the confusion in others!).  Of course, this is just FYI and YMMV, and I\'m not saying you should do what I did.  But I\'d be willing to bet real money that the odds are extremely good that a JetDrive 720 manufactured within the last 1-1.5 years (so, the vast majority of them) will fit just fine in your 2012-2013 15"" model, and a 725 will have zero problems fitting in any 2012-2013 13"" machine.', ""Transcend Jetdrive 720 240Go acquis en 2014 pour remplacer le ssd 128Go d'origine devenu trop petit dans un macbook pro retina de fin 2012.Aucun problème de fonctionnement jusqu'en janvier 2017 où il a été remplacé parce que devenu trop petit par un jetdrive720 480Go.Aucun problème avec le nouveau jusqu'en décembre 2017 où le disque a montré des défaillances puis n'a plus été reconnu et finalement a fini HS. C'est pourquoi je n'ai mis que 4 étoiles.Le produit étant garanti 5 ans (attention de bien conserver tous les documents, emballages et carte de garantie comme indiqué par Transcend), mail à Transcend pour savoir comment procéder.Pas de réponse dans les jours suivants donc échange par Chat avec Amazon qui propose immédiatement l'envoi d'un nouveau disque gratuitement sous réserve que je renvoie le défectueux dans un délai de 30 jours, Amazon a pris en charge les frais de renvoi alors que je réside hors France Métropolitaine.Le nouveau disque est arrivé quelques jours plus tard.Service après vente très efficace et courtois, je n'espérais pas des démarches aussi simples.Transcend m'a répondu au moins une bonne semaine plus tard pour procéder au changement mais je ne sais pas si cela aurait abouti puisque je n'avais pas la carte de garantie ni les emballages avec moi.Je n'ai pas encore essayé d'installer le nouveau disque qui est arrivé en France Métro alors que je n'y suis pas actuellement mais j'ai ré-installé l'ancien jetdrive 240Go qui fonctionne de nouveau très bien, en espérant qu'il en soit ainsi jusqu'à ce que je puisse tester le nouveau.Encore une fois, on ne rappellera jamais assez de faire des sauvegardes régulières et notamment par time machine et/ou sur des serveurs en ligne.A part ce souci, qui j'espère ne se renouvellera pas (on se passe de ce genre d'événement), c'est parfait pour augmenter la capacité du disque dur tout en gardant une bonne réactivité.C'est ordinateur est encore un très bon modèle, dans lequel des changements (RAM et disque) sont encore possible par rapport aux nouveaux où il faut anticiper dès l'achat.La possibilité de garder l'ancien disque dans un boitier pour en faire un disque dur externe très discret et élégant est parfait.Sur ce modèle de macbook pro, la carte mémoire transcend jetdrive lite qui vient se loger dans le slot pour carte SD sans dépasser trop du boitier du portable est un bon complément mais qui n'est pas sauvegardée par Time Machine et peut-être pas indexé par spotlight (je n'ai pas vérifié).Merci à Amazon pour la qualité du service après-vente."", 'Die SSD unseres MacBook pro Retina late 2012 war mit 128GB eindeutig zu knapp bemessen - durch Internetrecherche wurde ich auf dieses Transcend Kit aufmerksam, und die Gelegenheit für eine Vervierfachung des verfügbaren Speichers war verlockend.Das Kit beeindruckt zunächst schon dadurch, dass die Verpackungsgestaltung sehr eng an die von Apple Produkten angelehnt ist - einzig die Einschweißfolie ist etwas schwer zu entfernen. Der Inhalt ist in drei Ebenen auf weißen Plastik-Einlegern untergebracht - erst die SSD, dann das Alu-Gehäuse für den externen Anschluß als USB-3.0-Festplatte und schließlich Kabel, Montagewerkzeug und - man staunt - ein Etui für das Alu-Gehäuse.Die Vorgehensweise ist tatsächlich so einfach wie im Angebot beschrieben: Neue SSD in das Alu-Gehäuse einsetzen, als externe Festplatte am Mac anschließen und in den ""Recovery Modus"" (CMD-R) booten - dort per Festplattendienstprogramm die neue SSD formatieren und dann ein Abbild der Systemplatte dorthin rüberkopieren. Bei unserem System (Mac OS 10.10 ""Yosemite"") sehen die Funktionen etwas anders aus als in der beigefügten Anleitung, man findet aber die richtigen Einstellungen trotzdem ganz leicht.Dann folgt der ""fummelige"" Teil - Das MacBook ausschalten, Bodenplatte lösen (vorsichtig anheben, da sie mittig an zwei Stellen eingeclipst ist) und unbedingt auf die Schrauben achten, die sehr klein sind. Die beiden Schrauben hinten mittig am Displayscharnier sind übrigens kleiner als alle anderen und müssen auch exakt an dieselbe Stelle zurück - andere würden hervorstehen und zu Kratzern führen.Hat man die Bodenplatte gelöst, kommt der einzige Teil, bei dem die Anleitung nicht 100% akkurat ist: Beim MacBook pro Retina late 2012 befindet sich die SSD in einem schwarzen Gehäuse unter dem Trackpad. Zur Entnahme muss vorsichtig das Festplattenkabel gelöst werden (dazu sollte man eigentlich einen Kunststoff-Spatel (sog. ""Spudger"") benutzen, der im Kit nicht beigelegt ist - ein anderer nicht allzu scharfkantiger Gegenstand (z.B. Gitarren-Plektrum) tut\'s auch, jedoch hatte ich von einem iPhone-Repair-Kit genau den passenden Spudger eh rumliegen). Die Anleitung bei ifixit empfiehlt sogar, vorher den Akku abzuklemmen - das war aber nicht notwendig.Achtung: Man _kann_ den Austausch auch machen, ohne das Festplattenkabel zu lösen - wer aber einmal erlebt hat, was ein MacBook macht, bei dem das SATA-Kabel auch nur minimal geknickt wurde, möchte diese Erfahrung nicht riskieren.Ist das Festplattenkabel gelöst, wird der SSD-Träger vorsichtig aus seiner Position entnommen - der ""Handgriff"" ist dabei zugleich der Riegel, der das Teil in Position hält - einfach den Griff leicht nach hinten drücken und das komplette Teil nach oben herausnehmen. Der Träger ist unten offen und die SSD nur mit einer Schraube befestigt. Der Tausch ist einfach.Als positiven Nebeneffekt kann man nun noch den Staub von vier Jahren Benutzung aus dem Laptop entfernen - vorsichtiges Ausblasen ist besser als einen Staubsauger zu verwenden - wegen der Gefahr statischer Entladungen bitte keine Staubtücher oder Staubwedel nehmen.Danach wird einfach alles wieder eingebaut (unbedingt das Festplattenkabel _vorsichtig_ wieder anschließen damit die Kontakte nicht beschädigt werden) und der Boden montiert (durch sanften Druck auf die Mitte der Bodenplatte dafür sorgen, dass die Haltenasen wieder einrasten - sonst lässt sich das MacBook nicht einschalten)Nach dem Einschalten dauert es evtl. einige Sekunden bevor das MacBook startet. Anschließend sollte man sicherheitshalber in die Systemeinstellungen gehen und das ""Startvolume"" wählen (dazu wird noch einmal neu gestartet) - mit dieser Auswahl ist sichergestellt, dass weitere Neustarts gewohnt schnell gehen.Die alte SSD haben wir in dem externen Gehäuse ""geparkt"" - vorläufig als Backup, auf Dauer macht sie sich aber auch gut als rasend schneller (wenn auch etwas klobiger) Speicherstick-Ersatz.Perfekte Ergänzung wäre noch, standardmäßig den sicherlich nicht teuren Kunststoffspatel beizulegen, ansonsten ist das Kit perfekt und hat alle Erwartungen erfüllt. Klare Kaufempfehlung.', 'Ich habe mit der 480GB Version des Jetdrive 720 mein MacBook Pro 13"" Retina Late 2012 aufgerüstet. Dank des mitgelieferten externen USB-3 Gehäuses und der verständlichen Video-Anleitung war die Übertragung meiner Daten auf die neue SSD ein Kinderspiel.Leider war der Einbau der neuen SSD in mein Gerät nicht so einfach. Mitgeliefert werden Torx Schraubendreher des Typs T5 und P5. Die Anleitung sieht vor, dass das mit drei Schrauben gesicherte Batteriekabel abgeklemmt werden soll. Leider waren die mitgelieferten Schraubendreher zu klein für die Schrauben des Batteriekabels. Ich habe die SSD dann mit abgeklemmter Batterie gewechselt, was auch ging aber nicht zu empfehlen ist und zu einem Kurzschluss führen kann!Nach dem erfolgreichen Umbau zeigt die SSD eine sehr gute Leistung. Der BlackMagic Geschwindigkeitstest (im Appstore kostenlos erhältlich) wird die Datenübertragungsleistung beim Lesen mit ca. 480 MB/s, beim Schreiben mit ca. 400-420 MB/s angegeben. Das sind gute bis sehr gute Werte für eine SATA SSD.Bitte beachten:============- Aufgrund neuer Chips auf diesen SSDs sind alle SSD Modelle, die eine KLEINERE Gesamtkapazität als 480 GB haben beim schreiben deutlich LANGSAMER!!! Dies steht auch in der Amazon Produktbeschreibung!Früher war dieses Leistungsgefälle unterhalb von 256 GB Gesamtkapazität zu finden. Aufgrund der höheren Speicherdichte pro Chip hat sich das nun geändert. Aus diesem Grund ist die volle Datenübertragungsleistung der Jetdrives erst ab Modellen mit mindestens 480 GB Gesamtkapazität gegeben!- Der Umbau der alten SSD in das externe Gehäuse wird auf die Dauer Leistungseinbußen bei dieser SSD zeigen. Apple unterstützt für via USB angeschlossene SSDs den Leistungssteigernden TRIM-Befehl nicht. Nur SSDs, die via Thunderbolt angeschlossen werden, halten auf Dauer die volle Leistung! Das JetDrive USB-Gehäuse hat ausschließlich einen USB-Anschluss (USB2/USB3).- JetDrive ToolboxDas mitgelieferte Programm JetDrive Toolbox zeigt den ""Wear Out Indicator"", also den Anteil der Betriebszeit bis zum wahrscheinlichen Ausfall der SSD an. Hintergrund: jeder SSD Hersteller gibt für seine Geräte an, nach welcher Menge geschriebener Daten die Chips und somit die SSD kaputt gehen. Viele SSDs zeigen dies über den ""Wear Out Indicator"" an. Diese Anzeige sollte man auf jeden Fall ernst nehmen!!! Erreicht der ""Wear Out Indicator"" ca. 10% sollte man die SSD auf jeden Fall tauschen, da der baldige Defekt der SSD wahrscheinlich ist. Ich finde es aus diesem Grund sehr gut, dass dieses Tool bei Transcend zum Download angeboten wird. Der Ausfall eines einzigen Speicherchips führt bei einer SSD zum endgültigen Verlust aller gespeicherter Daten! Eine Reparatur wie bei einer Festplatte ist nicht möglich! Aus diesem Grund ist ein gutes Backup besonders für SSDs sehr wichtig. Also am besten gleich die Time Capsule mit bestellen :-)Fazit:====Bis auf die Sache mit dem Batteriekabel kann ich den JetDrive Aufrüstsatz empfehlen. Dank des mitgelieferten USB-Gehäuses ist die Übertragung des kompletten Betriebssystems inkl. aller Daten von der alten SSD auf die neue ein Kinderspiel und in wenigen Minuten erledigt. Nach dem Umbau der SSD startet der Mac dann sofort in alter Frische und alles ist da, ohne Installationsorgie. Die SSD ist sehr schnell. Der Aufrüstsatz ist günstig.Eventuell sollte man einen Torxy T6 Schraubendreher dazu bestellen (ich hoffe der passt, ich kann es nicht versprechen).', 'Der Einbau der SSD war sehr sehr einfach und innerhalb von 30 Minuten vollzogen und obwohl nur zwei Schraubendreher (Apple Pentalobe P5 und Torx 5) im Lieferumfang enthalten sind und die Schrauben für die Batterie eigentlich in der Größe einem T6 entsprechen, ließen auch diese sich ohne Problem mit dem T5 entfernen. Vielleicht ein Hinweis zu den P5 Schrauben des Gehäuses: sie kommen in zwei unterschiedlichen Längen und sollten am besten der Reihe nach heraus und wieder hineingedreht werden - so wie sie im Gehäuse waren. Außer der Tatsache, dass mein Late 2012 Retina MacBook Pro ziemlich verstaubt war und erstmal durchgeblasen werden musste gab es keine weiteren Zwischenfälle.Vor dem Kauf schrieb ich Transcend um nachzufragen, ob die SSD ihren eigenen Garbage Collection Algorithmus hat und ob dieser irgendwas taugt. Ich bekam vom freundlichen Kundenservice eine sehr schnelle und professionelle Antwort, die mir bestätigte, dass die SSD tatsächlich einen sehr funktionstüchtigen Algorithmus betreibt. Das ist auch unter OS X Yosemite zu bestätigen: TRIM ist nicht notwendig und war übrigens ursprünglich von Apple auch gar nicht vorgesehen (kann man auf sämtlichen Websites und Wikipages über Apples Samsung SSDs und TRIM support lesen), falls es hier noch jemanden gibt der sich darum Sorgen macht, dass seine neu eingebaute SSD nicht so flink ist wie mit TRIM und vor allem, weil das Thema hier immer wieder angesprochen wurde und als ein negatives Feature beurteilt wird. Gibt nix negatives. In der Tat bringt der Blackmagic Disk Speed Test im Vergleich zur Stock SSD (bei mir) die folgenden Werte:5GB Stress Test:Alt:Write 343 MB/s, Read 431 MB/sNeu:Write 437 MB/s, Read 478 MB/s (mit TRIM: 435 MB/s und knapp 481 MB/s)Und das nach einem Preconditioning von mehrfachem Kopieren sehr großer Mengen an Daten (SSD fast voll, wieder leer, wieder voll, etc.). Wem also die drei (manche Benchmarks sagen bis zu 30, was ich nicht nachweisen konnte) MB/s tatsächlich fehlen, der kann gerne für viel viel Geld eine größere Stock SSD von Apple bestellen (natürlich nicht ÜBER Apple, sondern über iFixit, z.B.) und auf das geniale externe USB 3.0 Gehäuse von Transcend verzichten.Noch eine kleine Bemerkung zum Einbau der alten SSD in das mitgelieferte USB 3.0 Gehäuse von Transcend: meine Stock SSD hatte ein dickes silikonartiges Pad auf dem Controller kleben. Einfach abmachen und keine Sorgen machen, denn Transcends Adapter im Gehäuse hat eine antistatische Folie drauf und schützt so auch die Stock SSD.Für diejenigen, die TRIM immer noch nicht ganz verstehen, einfach mal bei Wikipedia nachlesen und ein paar videos auf Youtube dazu schauen. Inzwischen sagen außerdem die meisten Hersteller das TRIM überflüssig geworden ist. Übrigens sind weder Firmwareupdate noch Transcend Toolbox notwendig um die Festplatte anständig betreiben zu können. Sind lediglich Gimmicks.Mein Tip also: Nicht so lange den Kopf zerbrechen, kaufen. Ist ein super Upgrade für die älteren rMBPs. ;-)', 'I bought this drive as an upgrade to the 256GB Samsung SSD that came with by 2012 15"" rMBP.The package contains everything you need. It includes 2x screw drivers with the relevant heads. I particularly like how the screwdrivers are magnetic which helps in removing the old screws.The drive is very easy to install and it took me about 10 minutes to do it all. It took far longer to restore everything from Time Machine.The drive seems to work well and doesn\'t suffer any slowdown when dealing with incompressible data, e.g. when FileVault is enabled.Running the BlackMagic disk test, the old Samsung scored 326MB/s write, 340MB/s read. This Transcend JetDrive scored 424MB/s write and 507MB/s read, so this is a pleasant surprise.This is an excellent upgrade as it\'s improved both capacity and speed, though I don\'t actually notice any difference in speed as the old drive was fast enough for my needs.edit:After 4 months of daily use (loads of VM work, building software, etc) I can say that my feelings about this drive is mixed. I ran into problems when I upgraded to Yosemite and enabled ""TRIM"" using Transcend\'s JetDrive toolbox. I had to wait initially for Transcend to update the  JetDrive toolbox to support Yosemite. Then once it did and TRIM was enabled, I noticed a lot of instability and a number of times when the drive would fail to boot. Wiping the drive and restoring images from Time Machine did not help.Reinstalling everything manually and re-enabling TRIM also seemed to cause problems. However, fully reinstalling everything and not re-enabling TRIM appears to have solved my problems. I suspect that the changes to drivers in Yosemite (look up kext signing on the Internet) is at the root of this and the Transcend have not properly tested their drivers. So for now, I\'ve not bothered with TRIM and have had no issues.I\'m knocking off one star off the review for this, and I would have been a lot happier if Transcend had bothered to get their drivers approved  and signed by Apple.', 'I have a mid-2012 15"" Retina MacBook Pro, model 10,1I bought the 960GB version to replace my stock Apple 512GB SSD, since I was almost out of space on that drive. After I ordered the drive, Transcend changed their compatibility details to exclude 15"" Retina MacBook Pros, but I had no problems installing the SSD in my machine, thankfully!The bad news is that the installation instruction video and Quick Start Guide are woefully inadequate and it took me quite a bit of searching to figure out exactly how to clone my existing SSD to the external JetDrive before swapping it out into the Macbook Pro. I am running OS X Mavericks 10.9.3 and my original drive was FileVault encrypted. Here\'s how I went about my installation, hopefully this will save someone else a bunch of time and make it easier to perform! (Four stars for the crud instructions, otherwise I\'m very happy with the product, so far!)Oh and BlackMagic Speed Test records write speeds of 415MB/s and read speeds of 450MB/s, so this is a nice, fast, large, if slightly costly, upgrade!Installation Instructions for OS X 10.9.3 users (with FileVault enabled on original SSD / HDD):1. Install the JetDrive into the external enclosure provided and plug in the enclosure to an empty USB slot2. Start the MacBook up, holding down Command + R. This will load the restore options. (This step wasted a good deal of my time)3. Click on Disk Utility4. Highlight Macintosh HD (or whatever your existing SSD / HDD is called)5. Click on Unlock in the menu bar, if your source drive is FileVault enabled. You cannot clone the drive while it is FileVault locked. (This step wasted a good deal of my time as well)6. Enter your password7. Click Restore with your source SSD / HDD selected (Macintosh HD by default)8. Drag ""Transcend"" to the Destination slot (you will now have your existing SSD / HDD chosen as the Source and the new Transcend drive chosen as the Destination)9. Click RestoreThe cloning process took about 40 mins for my nearly full 512GB Apple SSD to clone to the new JetDrive. After that it was just a matter of swapping out the new SSD for the old one and then a couple more steps...10. With the new drive installed, restart holding down Command + R again11. Click on Disk Utility12. Under the Disk Utility menu click on Startup Disk13. Select your new SSD, this should be the only option if you do not have any other drives plugged-in to your system, and restart the system (this step tells the OS to default to your new drive on startup every time, otherwise it wastes several seconds searching for your old HDD / SSD at startup before using the new drive to boot)14. Check if TRIM is enabled by clicking on the Apple menu, About this Mac, More Info, System Report, Click on SATA and check to see if it says ""TRIM Support YES"". If it does, you\'re good to go. If it doesn\'t...15. Go to [...] and dowload the app16. Run the app and flick the switch from Off to On17. Restart your MacBook and you\'re good to go!', 'I\'m delighted with this upgrade package from Transcend.  This is a high quality replacement 480 GB SSD for Macbook Pro which was installed with ease.  It has nearly doubled the storage space available AND given increased disk read/write speeds.  My factory installed SSD (Sandisk 256GB) achieved speeds of c. 454 MB/s read, 390 MB/s write.  This Transcend Jetdrive 720 (480GB) achieves speeds of 522 MB/s read, 437 MB/s write (BlackMagicDesign DiskSpeedTest).  The System Report confirms that the drive is an Intel 7 Series Chipset with 6 Gigabit link speeds on the SATA/SATA Express device.  TRIM support and SMART status are verified.The startup speed is slightly quicker when the System Preferences/Startup Disk is correctly selected.  Make certain that you go to the Transcend support pages and view the correct video for the Macbook, Operating System and Jetdrive configuration that you have.  Some reviews state that they cannot enable TRIM - but this is only the case when running \'old\' versions of Mac OS.  My install was with a mid-2013 Macbook Pro Retina 13"", running Mac OSX 10.11.6, El Capitan.  TRIM was enabled in the native operating system using the instructions provided by Transcend in their FAQ pages.Only one slight niggle.  Transcend provide a P5 screwdriver (for Macbook bottom case cover) and T5 screwdriver for the internal battery adaptor screws.  In my Mac, (MacBookPro10,2) the internal battery adaptor screws were T6!I purchased this \'Used\' item from Amazon Warehouse deals for 2/3rds the retail price for new!  The box had previously been opened/reselaed and there was some sticker residue on the original retail box.  All the contents were perfect and the SSD had never been used.  The full five year warranty still applies to my purchase.  I was very happy with this deal.', 'I\'ve been using this Transcend SSD (480GB) for 100 days now, and I\'m rather disappointed. I upgraded from my stock 128GB Samsung SSD on my 13"" rMBP. In using my old SSD, I’ve encountered 0 crashes or restarts for 24 months since first purchasing my Retina Macbook Pro 13”.However, Transcend JetDrive 720 SSD drive has crashed 12 times or more in just 3 months.To maintain longevity and durability of my new SSD, I’ve read on other forums that you should allow for ~20% free space on your disk. While doing a clean install of OS X Yosemite 10.10.2, I allowed for 95GB (19% of Total Space) to be partitioned as empty space to prevent wear+tear on the SSD, which may or may not apply to newer SSDs. I\'m only using ~162 GB of the 383 GB on the first partition while the other 95GB on the second partition is completely unused and empty. I have TRIM enabled, and followed all directions on the Transcend website for this SSD yet I still get many crashes.System Specs:MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2012)Processor 2.5GHz Intel Core i5Memory 8GB 1600 MHz DDR3Graphics Intel HD Graphics 4000++Via Black Magic Speed Test, I get 431 MB/s Write Speed, and 511MB/s Read Speed on Transcend JetDrive 720, comparable to the stock SSD from Samsung.While installing, I backed up my files to HDD and I recommend you do too. Also, a clean install is said to be a smoother process than using Time Machine Backup or Upgrading OS X.Final note:I\'m not a power user, don’t do photo/video editing, minimal gaming (4 hours a week) but I get a lot of freezing issues when using Safari and opening more than 8 tabs… this should NOT be happening. I also can’t go back to being confined on Apple/Samsung 128GB drive. Guess I’m stuck with this buggy driveUPDATE 11-November 2015.After owning this drive for 8 months, I\'ve updated my recommendation from 2 star to 5 stars. Updating to OS X 10.11 El Capitan has greatly improved the performance of the drive. There are no more issues listed above, the computer does not freeze.Transcend customer service was very timely and courteous and replaced my drive right away after I wrote my initial 2 star review. I had tested the new drive for 4 months since June and noticed a big difference between OS X 10.10 and OS X 10.11. Very satisfied customer. Thanks- Transcend and Amazon.', ""I purchased the JetDrive 720 960GB version to replace the 500GB drive in my Retina Macbook Pro, 15-inch, Early 2013. I do a lot of video editing and was thinking about picking up a TB external firewire SSD to help with on-the-road editing. The JetDrive was intriguing because not only would I gain an additional 500GB internally, but I'd have an extremely capable and portable external drive, made of my internal 500GB Apple SSD. Overall, I am very pleased with the drive and the external enclosure for my OEM drive. Here are the pros and cons I've come up with after a few months of use:Pros:- Very easy to install, takes less than 5 minutes- Migration is easy, made large in part by how OSX works- As fast as my OEM drive. Average 400MB/s write and 450MB/s read.- TB internal drive, what's not to like?- External USB 3 enclosure is as good as it gets. Super fast (I use for FCPX projects with no issue) and super portableCons:- My wake from sleep time is now about 5 seconds, Apple OEM drive was 1 second- Boot time is now about 45 seconds, OEM drive was about 15***Update 8/1/14***I did a clean install of the OS and migrated my data back from a Time Machine backup and all is right with the world. No more delayed wake from sleep and long boot times. Something must have gone wrong with permissions or what not with the copy transfer. Updating from 4 to 5 stars. Excellent drive.I did the copy-style migration, where you basically copy your existing drive and swap them out. This is the first time I've done that type of migration. When I have some downtime, I may do a clean OS install on the drive and use migration assistant from my time machine backup and see if this alleviates some of the boot/wake delay.Other than that, normal performance is great and having the extra breathing room for internal storage has made my life so much easier.

Das RNS legt bei der Installation der Firmware im Hintergrund verschiedene Partitionen für die betreffenden Inhalte (Musik/Navi etc.) an. Die SSD macht das RNS 510 nicht zur Rakete da der langsame Prozessor (für heutige Verhältnisse) auch nicht flotter dadurch wird.

Several years ago I maxed out its RAM (to 2GB) and installed Windows 7 Ultimate Edition (the machine was originally designed for Windows XP). Everything was working great but over the years with the installation of service packs, hotfixes, additional apps and utilities, the machine had gotten quite slow and I found the hard drive to be the performance bottleneck. After purchasing the 128GB Transcend PSD330 drive, I was able to clone my old 95GB PATA drive to this SSD, and installed it into the laptop; the drive fit perfectly, being the same form factor as the old 2.5"" mechanical PATA drive (I just had to be careful to set the master/slave/cable select jumper the same way it was set on the old drive). After this change, my laptop is fast again; gone are my excessive waits browing the web, taking the machine out of hybernation, and even while starting it up. Although the PATA interface only runs at 100MB/s max (much slower than today\'s SATA disks), with this near-zero latency SSD the performance has improved significantly and is now more than acceptable for my type of use. In fact, the Windows Experience Index (for the hard drive specifically) changed to 5.9 from 4.2 after installing this drive in my notebook which is excellent. As you may expect it is very quiet as well (no noise at all). I can\'t comment yet on durability but everything else so far has been a great experience. I am expecting this drive will extend my notebook\'s life for another two years or so, which makes it well worth the money spent on it.', 'I replaced a 100 GB HDD in my Dell Inspiron 9300 laptop with this Transcend 128 GB SSD and I have to say that it has been the best improvement that I could have made to this aging 9300 laptop. Not only do I have more disk capacity, but also the WEI subscore for the disk data transfer rate increased from 4.4 with the HDD to a significantly increased 5.9 with the Transcend SSD. This upgrade alone has made my laptop performance so much better. The SSD was easy to install and it fit perfectly in the drive caddy. I performed a fresh, clean install of Windows 7 Home Premium onto the SSD and Windows is running absolutely great on it. The SSD has breathed new life into my Inspiron 9300, making it a lot more pleasant to use with its increased performance. Note that the SSD packaging clearly shows a ""Compatible with Windows 7"" logo on it so you can be assured that it works with Windows 7 PCs. I would highly recommend this SSD to anyone that wants to replace a traditional IDE/ATA HDD in their laptop. It\'s been a real blessing having this SSD ever since I installed it. It\'s by far an excellent performer, and it runs whisper quiet. Definitely worth a five start rating.', 'I had high hopes for this drive, and took a chance.  I installed it in an ASUS W-5F laptop.  No joy; the computer doesn\'t see it at all.  The bios can\'t see it, so I can\'t do anything with it.  I reset the bios to default, and everything else I could think of, with no success.It\'s a solid portable that we bought in early 2006. [...]Don\'t bother. I bought it a year ago for the Asus W5-F. Worked great for about 9 months. Then, it starting ""hanging"" on file downloads. Now, it hangs about 5 minutes after booting into windows. It was great while it lasted, but the expense I paid to retain a nostalgic piece of gear could have been spent towards a an i3 setup...I will be returning the drive in the next few days.  I wish there was a PATA to SATA solution for laptops.', 'Unit arrived within the quoted delivery timeframe quoted. Unit fired up and all is good so far.']"

But part of this review is *definitely* going to be generally useful to anyone contemplating upgrading an older PATA based machine (including, lol, probably at least one reviewer who reported performance problems with his XP install after a few months had passed).I figure that almost anyone even thinking about doing something like this is probably pretty technically adept already, so my primary purpose here is less in recommending the drive itself (and, I do recommend it) than to detail specific details of my own machine upgrade. And to include some generally useful procedures (new ""tricks"" whoo-hoo) for doing this sort of upgrade....if you weren\'t a relatively experienced DIY\'er, you probably wouldn\'t be bothering with something like this.--------------------------------SSD BRIEF REVIEW:As for the Kingspec SSD itself? - Well, it\'s a good price for a relatively rare beast. PATA SSD\'s aren\'t ever going to be all that common ...it was just luck of the draw that I took this over the Transcend version I was also looking at.To cut to the quick, I\'d buy another Kingspec in a heartbeat, and I have no problem in recommending it. (I have five other machines with SATA SSD\'s btw, so I\'m not exactly a noob\' regarding their care and feeding.)--------------------------------SSD DETAILS:I had no dimensional fitment issues:_1. the SSD was *exactly* the same size in every dimension as the OEM Seagate Momentus 4200.2 (Mod. No. ST960821A) I pulled out of the drive tray_2. the SSD bolted to the drive bay as expected_3. the tray assembly subsequently slid into the laptop HDD drive bay perfectly_4. the SSD pins plugged into the internal PATA connector smoothly_5. there were no clearance issues whatsoeverI had no BIOS-related issues: the Kingspec was immediately picked up by the [old] Acer BIOS. (The drive jumper came set to the typical ""master"" setting that a boot PATA drive should be set to ...it\'s been awhile since I\'ve seen one of those lol.)I have had no performance issues for the few days it\'s been running (and I will follow-up if I ever do) ...I\'ve observed the performance is significantly better than the Momentus it replaced (in W7 WEI, the SSD has a 5.9 rating ...so it\'s easily the fastest HW component in the little Acer lol ...uh, there\'s no ""WEI"" in XP, so all I can say is that the OS boots faster, the laptop resumes from hibernation - and sleep mode - WAY faster, and applications and the like load way, way faster).Battery life seems the same (although at this point, both the batteries on the Acer are - unsurprisingly- in dire need of replacement); I just don\'t have a good baseline of comparison here though, so YMMV.--------------------------------BACKGROUND:I purchased a 3002WTCi [ultra-light] as an onsite laptop in late summer 2007 ...it was a faithful and invaluable asset for onsite work (I\'m a sys admin with 30 plus years experience) for over 3 years. After that, it did yeoman duty for another couple of years plus as a ""bedtime companion"", to catch up on the news and blogs late nights - I have minor insomnia - before I finally bought a \'droid Nexus tablet. The little Acer has pretty much sat on a shelf since then.The Acer originally came with a 64GB Seagate HDD that was partitioned into two 30GB logical drives ...one partition was still empty, and the boot partition was about 75% used with XP and MS Office and the various software utilities and files I found it useful to carry with me to onsite locations. So I was pretty sure the 64GB of the Kingspec wasn\'t going to pose any capacity limitation issues.I\'d thought about upgrading it with an SSD for several years, but it was hard justifying the expense (especially when I started to use it less). Plus, the techie community consensus seemed to be that the performance of a PATA SSD wasn\'t exactly all that much of an upgrade. (And finding PATA SSD\'s was no piece of cake a few years back, either.) Regardless, that was then, and now is now, and I\'ve my own SSD experiences to draw upon ...and at least as far as price (and aforementioned capacity), the Kingspec at 64GB wasn\'t going to be much of a budgetary hardship.--------------------------------OS UPGRADE:I decided that even though there\'s absolutely no driver support for Windows 7 for the little Acer (which has an old-school Intel 915GM graphics engine, and various other ancient and non-W7-supported HW bits and pieces ...you\'re not going to find W7 support for the 3002WTCi no matter how good your mad googling skillz are lol), it was still worth it to me to try a fresh W7 install, just to avoid the lack of support for TRIM in XP ...especially as TRIM support is kind of vital for an SSD, for longevity and performance, making a W7 attempt was ""worth a shot"".I also didn\'t want to deal with alignment issues with XP on an SSD either (there\'s a thread at oczforum.com - google ""How to Align OCZ SSD in XP using USB - SATA and Vista recovery disk"" - that explains the procedure pretty thoroughly).Sooo ...since W7 has TRIM support built-in, I decide a fresh install ""just to see"" would be worth the little additional effort involved in a new W7 install, even if I eventually decided I\'d have to undo it all, and go with XP (I didn\'t really have any vital and/or personal files to worry about - they\'d long since been copied to network storage - so there wasn\'t even a reason to clone the original drive: I just pulled the old HDD, and set it aside).Plus, I had the luxury of a spare W7-Home Premium license that I purchased years ago that I\'ve never used: like I said, ""...worth a shot.""--------------------------------OS INSTALL:The 3002WTCi is an ultra-light (by the old definition); it didn\'t have an internal optical drive to boot the W7 DVD setup disc from.So I googled around a bit, and found (and followed) instructions by Steve Tyler at instructables.com - google ""Install Windows 7 without USB or DVD without upgrading!"" - for doing a self-booting SSD install.Basically you copy the \\boot and \\sources folder and the ""boot"" file from the W7 DVD to the root of your freshly NTFS formatted SSD using a working PC, and use the Windows 7 diskpart utility to make the SSD active ...then, install the SSD to your laptop, and at first boot the process goes right into the familiar Windows 7 setup screen.I had absolutely no issues whatsoever with the setup portion of W7 on the little Acer. After a couple of the typical W7 setup process restarts, I had a working OS. Cool.NOTE: My W7 license was an upgrade license ...and the setup wouldn\'t accept the [entirely legal, as the laptop came with XP Pro] upgrade key because it was a ""new fresh install"" which was ""not supported by the upgrade license"". (The help menu suggested re-installing an earlier version of Windows, and then re-installing W7: LOLOL. *That* wasn\'t going to happen!) So I skipped past the license key entry screen (which turns a new install into a 30-day trial), and went looking for an alternative solution.To get around that problem [error code 0xC004F061], I found instructions by Kapil Arya at thewindowsclub.com (google ""FIX : Error 0xC004F061, Unable To Use Product Key For Clean Install"") that detailed changing a DWORD key setting in the Registry (change the value of HKLM/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Setup/OOBE/MediaBootInstall from the default value of ""1"" to a ""0"") and then running the command ""slmgr /rearm"" in an elevated prompt command  ...which fixed the issue.--------------------------------POST INSTALL DRIVER ISSUES:After the Windows Setup process was finally complete, I booted into an 800x600 resolution display (heck: at least it was better than 640x480), and was able to change that to 1024x768 using the default W7 VGA driver. The trackpad worked as far as basic functionality. The keyboard worked just fine. The wired network port didn\'t report any errors (thank you Broadcom). The USB ports worked (good thing, too). Gratifyingly enough, the laptop was more than marginally functional at first boot.All the more specialized HW bits were down. No internal wireless (this was *not* a huge issue AFAIWC, since I had stopped using the internal wireless years ago, as it simply couldn\'t connect to any modern-era, n-capable routers ...it was great with the old Linksys WRT54G, but c\'mon lol). No sound card (I\'m not sure there is sound yet, though the error is gone ...just haven\'t tested it). UPDATE (06/2014): I got the internal network card to work after all (it was me, not it lol).But - more serious - the stock W7 VGA driver didn\'t support the 1280x768 native resolution of the little Acer (a Very Big Deal that would have killed continuing using W7 for me).To cut to the chase: most driver related issues were fixable, by the simple expedient of installing the original XP drivers, in compatibility mode.(Find the particular XP era, driver setup executable, and right click, choose Properties, click the Compatibility tab, and check-mark ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:"" (choose XP) and you\'re good. At least in the case of the little Acer, XP drivers haven\'t appeared to cause any deal-killer problems.)The only caveat to installing XP drivers in compatibility mode is that the older Intel graphics driver - while supporting the resolution just fine - isn\'t, ever, going to win any speed contests.Plus, the Intel 915GM chipset simply does *not* support W7 Aero functions at all at the hardware level (which is not the fault of the driver itself); it\'s old, and that\'s just the way it is. There\'s no work-around. Which leads to: I\'d suggest (highly!recommend!) that you set the graphics properties to ""Classic Windows"" and change the Advanced Options to ""Performance"" ...because with those settings, the display performance is at least perfectly acceptable for mundane Internet related purposes like browsing and emails.The WEI 1.0 rating of the graphics card is the worst rating (of any piece of hardware) I\'ve ever seen. You\'re not going to do any gaming beyond solitaire with this, lol. But its performance *is* fine for almost anything else.--------------------------------MISC. OBSERVATIONS:I\'d do this again in a minute.It was well worth the $70 to have a reasonably quick ""spare"" laptop (whose entire history I am intimately familiar with).The Acer is much, much quicker in common usage with W7 on the SSD. Much. Quicker.(This observation seems to contrast with other reviewers who stayed with XP installs, and reported lesser gains. While the little Acer is [still] not a speed demon due to the use of an SSD, it is transparently and obviously faster ...which was also the case when we updated my wife\'s older Lenovo X-series laptop. So if you have a Windows 7 license, you might want to try upgrading even older, non-supported hardware - using XP compatibility mode for drivers - before you stay with XP. Just sayin\' - and YMMV - but W7 worked for me.)...I will follow-up in a few months if I have any additional observations. If the SSD has any issues at all, I\'ll also do a follow-up.--------------------------------UPDATE (06/2014):As stated above, the internal network card is, actually, working. (Basically, I should have been paying closer attention during the post-install setup lol.)...and I\'ve found the little laptop useful enough to have installed an old Office 2010 license to it (which install demonstrated that some hardware performance issues aren\'t mitigated by the faster SSD: the 2010 install took a couple of *hours* lol ...I\'ve upgraded to Office 2013 subscription for the rest of my workstations, and as the little Acer has proven to be - again - useful, I decided it needed a proper email app\' ...and I\'ve long since been an Office Outlook ""fanboy"" lol)....still no real issues. It\'s not a multi-tasking warrior (the Acer\'s 2GB of RAM is adequate for single-tasking), but it\'s proven pretty do-able for keeping a few IE tabs open. (I open Outlook ""as needed"", and close it afterwards.)', 'Sustitución de disco averiado', 'Verkäufer ist hat sich im persönlichen Kontakt mit mir sehr bemüht den Zustellungsfehler des letztenAuslieferungsservices wieder gut zu machen.Außerdem ist er einer der wenigen, die noch PATA SSD-Laufwerke zu einem guten Preis anbieten.', 'Clonage disque dur CIC BMW', 'Triple the storage on the laptop', 'Avevo idea di fare una recensione molto approfondita di questo prodotto, ma credo che alla fin fine le cose più impoprtanti da ricordare sono le seguenti. Avevo già acquistato da altro fornitore questo prodotto e ne ero rimasto soddisfattissimo per le prestazioni. Quando ho trovato lo stesso prodotto su amazon non ci ho pensato due volte e ho deciso di prenderne altri 3 pezzi con l\'intento di migliorare le prestazioni di altrettanti vecchi notebook con Hard Disk IDE Arrivati tre pezzi che avevo ordinato, a parte il case completamente differente da quello che avevo già in casa, al momento del test sono rimasto sorpreso negativamene per le prestazioni misurate. In particolare avevo problemi di riconoscimento della modalità di funzionamento IDE. Questo era dovuto in parte perchè uno dei notebook aveva un chip che arriva al massimo a UDMA5 mentre gli altri 2 fino a UDMA6. Mi capitava che i 3 HD venivano riconosciuti in maniera diversa quindi dai notebook. Anche le informazioni del BIOS risultavano differenti e le prestazioni pure. Capitava così 2 HD rispondevano prestazionalmente SOTTO le aspettative su tutti e 3 i notebook, mnetre uno di questi 3 HD faceva bella mostra di prestazioni solo su 2 dei tre notebook. Questa cosa mi aveva messo confusione perchè da un lato capivo che i notebook avevano prestazioni differenti, ma dall\'altro sembravano differenti anche gli HD. Provando e riprovando gli HD su PC diversi, andando ad utilizzare un adattatore IDE-miniIDE per poter collegare l\'HD su una mother board con connettore IDE standard, per confrontarne le prestazioni su un PC regolare, uno degli HD ha smesso di funzionare: non veniva più riconosciuto. Tra il nervoso e la rabbia sono risalito alla PROBABILE causa e cioè poteva essere successo che l\'adattatore volante utilizzato avesse toccato il case del pc durante una di queste prove e poteva essersi guastato l\'HD. Non ne ero certo, ma avevo i miei ragionevoli dubbi che poteva essere successo e quindi di avere guastato involontariamente l\'HD. Ero già intenzionato a tornarli indietro, ma ora che ne avevo (presumibilmente) guastato uno come potevo pretenderne la sostituzione? Rassegnato alla perdita ho deciso di aprirlo per verificare se poteva essere riparabile. Aprendolo però ho scoperto che l\'HD non era quello che avevo ordinato, ma un modello precedente (con un chipset differente).  In particolare con la board colore verde piuttosto che viola (come il modello che avevo in casa). L\'unico HD dei tre che mostrava buone prestazioni (quelle che mi aspettavo) aveva proprio la board colore viola e l\'altro ancora scarso era aveva la board colore verde come quello guastatosi (Il colore lo si può intravedere dal lato connettore IDE illuminando la fessura sul case con una torcia).A questo punto la situazione era che avevo ricevuto: 1 PRODOTTO CORRISPONDENTE ALL\'AQUISTO 2 PRODOTTI NON CORRISPONDENTI A questo punto ho contattato Amazon spiegando l\'accaduto e il problema dell fornitura di due modelli errati (a quel punto FAKE visto che l\'etichetta era corretta). Ho chiesto la sostituzione sicuramente di uno dei due HD sbagliati cioè quello ancora funzionante e ho richiesto di trovare una soluzione per quello che PRESUMIBILMENTE avevo guastato io, anche se questo era accaduto durante una serie di test infinita per cercare di capire le motivazioni della variabilità delle prestazioni. Amazon come mi aspettavo, non poteva sotituirmi quello che avevo aperto ma ha contattato il fornitore cinese che si è detto disponibile a sostituirmeli  a patto che glieli avessi spediti TUTTI E TRE (cioè quello esatto, quello sbagliato funzionante e quello sbagliato guasto). Certo ho speso mi pare 50 euro per la spedizione ma ho ricevuto immediatamente indietro 3 nuovi modelli ESATTI e prestazionalmente come me li aspettavo e anche se alla fin fine ci ho ""rimesso"" la spedizione, si potrebbe dire invece che il modello nuovo al posto di quello guasto mi è costato quanto la spedizione, quindi ad un prezzo più conveniente. Gli errori ci stanno sempre da parte di tutti quindi la cosa importante per me è che sono stati disponibili a venirmi incontro non solo per la parte di cui era giusto dovessero rispondere, ma anche per la parte di cui non erano in realtà tenuti a fare nulla se non per un aspetto ""morale"" di sostegno al danno. La cosa importante comunque per chi volesse acquistare questo modello, è di ricordarsi di verificare la corrispondenza del modello ricevuto attraverso il riconoscimento della board che DOVREBBE essere viola e non verde (il colore potrebbe anche cambiare però a seconda delle successive versioni di board) e ancor di più le prestazioni del prodotto ricevuto.', 'Felt that the OEM BMW HD in the CIC entertainment system was getting old and glitchy.

This drive is not up to the task as a daily driver running core operating system and installed software.Since I\'m well past the return, I continued to use the GK as a secondary drive until I can get a solid performing mSata. Basically it\'s used to store large 40GB+ games (steam, ubi, etc), virtual machines and other storage hungry software : NOTE I do not use this to store videos, pictures or audio/music. So, all things considered, it has acceptable enough performance, and the computer\'s overall experience is not degraded with exception to a few case scenarios. To practice CyberSecurity I run a variety of VMs and build a test lab of sorts on my one laptop. While this drive stores the VMs it\'s way too slow creating virtual disks (and I\'m only building 32G drives), so what I do is build/clone the vm on one of my faster drives and then copy it all over to the GK - this saves me at least 45-min compared to building on the GK.[Original Review]SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy something reputable.I bought this for my gaming laptop that came with two drives installed: 128GB Liteonit SSD for the Operating System and 1TB HGST Travelstar 7k1000 for everything else.We all know 128GB is too small these days, Windows takes up 40GB on a fresh install and games these days are 30-40GB. I figured with a 500GB SSD I can run windows and install games on the same disk instead of saving & loading everything from the secondary drive because games took a long time to load.Unboxing the ""GamerKing"" SSD was my first warning and cause for return because this SSD is infact a ""DOGFISH"" SSD with a GamerKing sticker. But, I was traveling for work and the difference between Dogfish and Gamerking was a toss-up -- I just happened to add the Gamerking to my cart. This was in September 2019. Windows and UEFI (BIOS) Read a DOGFISH SSH TOO for what its worth.I\'m still traveling and it is now April 2020 and as I use my laptop more and more I am really noticing how slow AF my laptop is running. I click a button, icon on the desk and the computer just sits there for 10 seconds or more..Sometimes I keep clicking in frustration. Happens when browsing the Internet and not running anything else and was getting down to my last nerve. I clean out the laptop, blow out all the dust. I have fresh installed Windows four times and after going through all the Feature updates ... same thing. I\'m checking the CPU utilization, memory utilization, everything. SO then I download userbenchmark and run to see what the hell this computer is doing..The whole problem is this lousy GAMERKING SSD!@#$ Are you kidding me? ITs performance is on par with a standard 5400rpm  drive! Holy cow. So I think, well maybe it\'s because I\'m using it as my main SSD. I load up Windows Install Disk, delete every volume/partition on both SSDs, and reinstall Windows on my old 128GB Liteonit.Same test, different results. Liteon and Gamerking are on the same bus - a dual stack MSATA connection. See my image for test results.[EDIT] I guess there\'s no option for pictures so here\'s benchmark for sequential and random access.Liteonit  SusWrite @10s intervals: 301  304  306  306  290  305 MB/sDogfish  SusWrite @10s intervals: 261  43  54  54  43  55 MB/s <----- SO LOW!!!Travelstr  SusWrite @10s intervals: 115  115  112  114  118  119 MB/sUserbenchmark note: Performing above expectations (92nd precentile)  with an overall bench score of 85.6%  Liteonit LMT-128M6M ***** Sequential *****:  Read: 475  Write: 304  Mixed: 252  SusWrite: 302  Benchmark 85.6% @ 333 MB/s  Liteonit LMT-128M6M ***** Random 4K *****  Read: 29.1  Write: 55.7  Mixed: 31.1 Benchmark 113% @ 38.6 MB/sUserbenchmark note: Performing below expectations (25th precentile)  with an overall bench score of 42.8%  Dogfish 512GB ****** Sequential ******  Read: 493  Write: 425  Mixed: 30.3  SusWrite: 85 Benchmark 57% 258 MB/s  Dogfish 512GB  ****** Random 4K ******  Read: 25.7  Write: 19.3  Mixed: 1.2  Benchmark 51%  15.4 MB/sAnd for funUserbenchmark note: Performing below expectations (25th precentile)  with an overall bench score of 42.8%  HGST Travelstar 7k1000 2.5"" 1TB  ****** Sequential ******  Read: 73.1  Write: 72.4  Mixed: 21.1  SusWrite: 115 Benchmark 51% 70.5MB/s  HGST Travelstar 7k1000 2.5"" 1TB  ****** Random 4K ******  Read: 0.7  Write: 1.6  Mixed: 0.6  Benchmark 126% 0.97 MB/s', 'De momento no me ha dado ningún problema y la instalación fué sencilla', 'Funciona perfecto en Steam Deck', 'Quedo excelente y buena velocidad =) recomendado.', ""The first one I received was broken, bur sometimes you get a dud ( dont just call it junk, unless you've tried a second one).

I took everything out of the box, and it gives you the metal housing and 2 white thermal paste pads and 2 grey thermal paste pads and a very small screw.  After researching on the web and trying to figure out how the thermal paste pads go, I couldn't find anything at all about it.  So just like almost everyone else I put a white thermal paste pad on the bottom and a grey one together after you peel the plastic off each side of the thermal paste pads.  I repeated this for the top metal piece thinking that would work.  Then I got to looking at the M.2 drive itself before putting it in the metal housing, and it don't tell you what side you put up or down before putting on the top metal piece and snapping it together.  So, after all the dead ends, I came back here to return the SSD drive maybe because the drive itself after all 4 thermal paste pads were installed, the metal housing for the drive wouldn't snap together.  So, I decided to scroll down a bit and saw that the M.2 drive installs chip side up and I also noticed from watching another M.2 install video that the person in that video had 1 white thermal paste pad on the bottom metal housing piece and then they put the M.2 drive chip side up and put 1 grey thermal paste pad on the top metal housing piece, and guess what..... I was able to finally snap the housing on my drive and have it install correctly.  But that still isn't the end... I got my PS5 out and the metal door for the SSD drive off and when I went to put the drive in the PS5 I noticed the end piece that has the gold metal connectors wasn't fitting to good into the slot on the PS5.  So, I push the drive just a little back out, so the gold metal pieces were showing a bit more.  So, after all of the BS and LACK of directions for install I got it working.

I wanted something to expand the storage in my PS5, since for some reason next-gen consoles only come in ""1TB"" models--which in actual fact are more like 800GB models. This was easy to install in my console, but make sure you have a #1 screwdriver on hand because this product does not come with one and you\'d need it to remove the fastening screw. It is indeed a full 2 terabytes. The transfer speed is pretty good; frankly I\'m not sure what kind of transfer speed should be expected these days, but I think it took about a half hour to move a terabyte and a half, which I honestly consider pretty good. Comes with the heatsink needed for the PS5, which is great. Basically everything I needed in an M.2 drive for some $50 less than what the other manufacturers charge.

So I turn my PS5 back on and I get a message that says my drive was removed. I already know what this means. The drive is dead. Tried a few times to remove and reinstall the drive with no luck.

When you first get this NVMe SSD, it also comes with a thin metal heat spreader along with a thermal pad, m.2 mounting screws and a mini screwdriver. The mini heatspreader can be a bit annoying to install, however, as it is designed to clip onto the sides of the SSD, but forcing it on is tedious and made me worry that I could damage it in the process. Aside from that, applying the thermal pad was simple, and the SSD worked perfectly once the heat spreader was attached and installed inside my PC.Through my motherboard when installed directly, I pulled nearly the advertised speeds, but when then removing the SSD and placing it into an NVMe enclosure over USB, the same cannot be said. It's not slow by any means when using it in an enclosure, but it is definitely intended to be installed directly to the motherboard. When installed directly, I was able to transfer 678 GB of videos and other content in around 10 minutes from my other internal NVMe SSD, but when using it in the enclosure the same transfer took around 28 minutes. This could simply be a limitation of the USB port itself, but that's still a respectable transfer time and is even fast enough to run games when using it over a USB connection.The real impressive part, however, is the PS5. Despite the 5.5GB/s recommended specs for the PS5, the SSD still worked even though it did not perform to its specification. I even transferred over some PS5 exclusives such as Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, and God of War: Ragnarok, and all were able to run just as well as if they were installed to the integrated PS5 console storage. While the games work just fine on it in the PS5 for now, some games in the future might more closely utilize the PS5's recommended speeds at which point the SSD may or may not work as well (at that point it would still work great for older PS4 games).Overall, this is a great NVMe SSD that is more than capable of holding its own against the competition, but it doesn't cost all that much lower than some higher speed SSDs in the same class. Regardless, I am very happy with it, and I would highly recommend giving it a chance."", 'I am using this 1 Tb NVMe SSD in a Sabrent external USB enclosure connected to a USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type A motherboard port via a certified superspeed data cable.In this configuration, I am transferring files at amazing speeds both to and from the SSD reaching 980MB/sec under some conditions which is right at the claimed limit for this excellent enclosure. While I realize that this is still far below the manufacturer’s claimed maximum speeds for installation on the motherboard, it is of course, lightning fast for an external drive.During extensive file transfer speed tests, the drive became just barely warm, likely due to the layer of heat transfer tape that it comes equipped with out of the box and the aluminum enclosure that is designed to act as a heatsink.Working with my extensive digitized music collection, this drive allowed me to move very large folders from my NAS storage to specific local PC servers with ease. I have been using Western Digital Elements drives prior to this solution and this SSD in the external enclosure is running over 10 TIMES faster.About the only things that I can find that make this drive less than perfect are the current cost (as of 6/29/23), which, even with the applicable coupon, equals the price of drives from established big-name suppliers for similar hardware, and a lack of attention to detail. To their credit, MOVESPEED provides a 5-year warranty and their drive comes with mounting screws and a micro screw driver. Unfortunately, though, their attention to detail is lacking, as the supplied screwdriver barely fits the head of the screw and cams out while tightening. A proper Phillips™ 000 (triple zero) tip fits much better, hence that’s what should have been included. (see pictures)']"

Most common USB-C enclosures are 10 Gbps and you might get 1000 MB/s over USB, leaving a potential 6000 MB/s wasted. This drive will do up to 7000 MB/s (on reads), as advertised. You can spend a lot less if you're just looking for something to put in an enclosure.Now, I didn't really put these drives through a rigorous test. After all, benchmarks tend to reduce the lifespan of SSDs. However, to give us an idea of how this drive performs, I ran a Crystal Disk Mark test against my existing XPG Gammix S70 Blade PCIe4 SSD and the MegaPC PCIe4 SSD. The read performance of the MegaPC drive is on par with the XPG on the 128MiB test. It's the write test that distinguishes the MegaPC drive from the XPG drive, where it only reached about 70% of the XPG's performance.Now, if you consider the SSD I'm comparing this product to is about twice the price for the same size, it makes this product an excellent value. Gaming is typically read heavy, so this would make a great budget gaming PC drive. Now this may not have the longevity of the XPG, but I still think I'd rather have two of these than one of the XPGs if write performance wasn't a concern for the application.Overall, this is a great value for the performance. I recommend to anyone looking for performance on the cheap."", 'I used this with an pcie nvme adapter and it has been rock solid. Speeds are a little under the advertisement but it is a big improvement over a SATA expansion. Highly recommended.', 'The MegaPC PCIe SSD 512GB NVMe M.2 2280 Internal Solid State Hard Drive is a great drive at a great price. Unfortunately the motherboard I have only has the PCIe 3.0 M.2 Slot. The MegaPC is backwards compatible. I used the MegaPC SSD as the primary OS drive running Windows 10. Previously I was using a Western Digital Blue SATA SSD as my primary OS drive. Boot times using the MegaPC are significantly faster.My plan is to upgrade my motherboard to one that has the PCIe 4.0 M.2 Slot. I will update my review when I do so. If you are in the market for a PCIe 4.0 M.2 Slot SSD, the MegaPC PCIe SSD 512GB NVMe M.2 2280 Internal Solid State Hard Drive should be at the top of your list.

The styling looks nice, and the chips on it appear good . However, I've struggled with two issues with it and they're such easy fixes.First, the manual. It leaves a little to be desired if you're looking for more information about your drive. Like it says 7000 MB/s, but is that read speed? write speed? both? it's not usually identical but sometimes it is. What about read/write limits? like how many passes is this rated for before it fails? (some go up to 100,000 and that will last a good long while, but others are much less).Especially if you haven't worked much with computers, knowing good NVMe operating temps would be nice, or how to apply a cheap metal heatsink if you buy one (it doesn't come with one, only the barest hardware, but that's fine for me).The second thing which is related is, nowhere on the web listing or in the manual could I find what key this is. Now if you study the photos you might figure it out, but photos are (in my experience) NOT what we should be relying on; documentation is always better.This is an M-keyed drive and my only spot for it is a B-key. What does this mean? not a whole lot except that they're not compatible. So until I get my hands on an M-key enclosure or something like it, this pretty looking thing has to wait for proper tests. - - - OTHER NOTES - M-key drives tend to be more common than B-keyed in my observation, but many are keyed to fit both. - M-keys, in my observation, have slightly better performance. - Never try to install an M-key into a B-key. It may look like it could work by flipping it over, but at best it won't and at worst you'll wreck your drive AND host controller. - We can tell the difference between the two by looking at the little nub keyed to the side. M-keys have one less contact strip (the little bronze stripes) than B-keys. - You really should consider a heatsink, as these can get hot very quickly in operation. They can tolerate it, but it isn't good for their longevity. - If you've not installed one of these before, make sure to check that your motherboard or enclosure is size-compatible with it. 2280 is its size (this part is listed at least) and this information can be found on most manufacturer listings."", ""This a great SSD and installed easily in my second M.2 port. My PC recognized it after the basic setup and I migrated all my games to it without issue. I've had no problem playing some memory and speed-heavy games like GTA V and such on this new drive, so I consider that a win. I got the 512 GB version and doubled up my laptop storage, and freed up the space on my OS M.2. I've been running it for a while now and haven't seen any problems yet, so I can definitely recommend this SSD to anybody needing to expand their storage capacity.""]"

I\'m happy with them considering this will just be a data storage drive for an Unreal Engine project.The cons: it\'s not the fastest SATA SSD out there.  There is absolutely no mention of the drive\'s TBW or endurance rating so you don\'t know what it\'s likely lifespan will be.  I\'ve seen TBWs as low as 120 on SATA SSDs from a reputable manufacturer like Crucial so there\'s no telling where this one falls.  You\'ll want to use a SMART monitoring tool to keep an eye on the drive\'s lifespan rating.  It should update periodically and give you an estimated % life remaining.It is one of the most affordable 1TB SSDs on Amazon at the moment.  If you use the current coupon offer it comes down to about $38.  The cheapest 1TB SSD at MicroCenterif you\'re lucky enough to have on near you is running $45.  Assuming the drive\'s endurance is decent I think it\'s a pretty good deal.']"

Heatsink, thermal pads and a screw driver were included in the packaging.', ""I have used a few Fikwot SSDs in the past and they have proven to be decent. Needing a new NVMe drive for my computer, I didn't hesitate to try this one too.The drive comes in a typical M.2 NVMe form factor and also comes with a metal heatsink that helps to keep the drive cool in use - something that is needed with the newer and faster drives. This comes detached in case you need to fit the drive in a more enclosed space but that does mean the drive gets much warmer than it otherwise would.For anyone who has used and replaced M.2 drives in the past, fitting this one is simple and took seconds. The highest speed benefits come when using the latest PCIe connectors supporting the latest standards, but I still found some speed improvements even on slightly older standards. Overall, the benefits were worth it.One thing I did note was that the Fikwot website and link through the QR code on the pack no longer work. For a new model this is not helpful if you want to use it for use and fitting instructions."", ""I couldn't quite get this SSD to hit its claim of 5000Mb/s speeds...PerformanceHowever, it still delivered a consistent 3475Mb/s sequential read and 2555Mb/s write. For Random 4K IOPS, it did around 143K read and 128K write. The numbers stayed the same even though there was a lot of data saved on the drive. Many SSDs experience decreased performance when reaching full capacity, but this Fikwot SSD does not have this issue.Performance tier-wise, this puts this SSD in the mid-range. It doesn't get to fully utilize the PCIe Gen4 interface, but it would be fast for a Gen3. I would think of it as a fast Gen3 SSD, updated with a Gen4 interface.Inside Windows, it will do a write-to disk, at around 1800~1500Mb/s peak, and 600Mb/s after the SLC cache fills up. The read speeds consistently reach over 2000Mb/s, making it feel fast enough for most tasks. Additionally, the load times for games felt fine.Hardware DetailsThe controller is a Maxio MAP1602A, which is also known as MAP1602-I. The specifications for this controller indicate a maximum sequential read of 7200Mbps, sequential write of 6500Mbps, and 1,000K IOPS.The NAND is SYMN09TC1B1HCGC. Presumably, these are from YMTC and use a 128-layer 3D NAND. The information on these is difficult to find.The 512GB model, most likely, cannot fully utilize the full power of the MAP1602A controller.HeatThe SSD comes with a bonus heatsink. I didn't find the heatsink to be entirely necessary, even when used inside a laptop. The bare drive would sit at around 44C idle, and peak at 50C. Installing the heatsink dropped idle to 40C, and peak to 49C.The drive does run warm when idle, but it doesn't get hot enough for a heatsink to be all that much beneficial either.ConclusionOverall, I would rate this PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD from Fikwot to be a solid 4/5. The SSD might not be the fastest, but does offer solid performance. It comes with a heatsink and adhesive thermal pads as a bonus, which adds extra value.ExtraIf you do want to install the heatsink anyways, you might find that there are no instructions in the packaging.Installing the heatsink is fairly easy, but it's recommended to have a pair of scissors and tweezers on hand.Instructions for installing the heatsink1. Cut the thinner (grey) pad to length for the NAND chips, and the thicker (white) pad for the controller.2. Peel off one (1) side of the clear backing on the pads, and stick them onto the SSD.3. Carefully peel off the clear backing from the other side of the pads. (If the pads peel off too, just do your best to get them back on again)4. Slide in the SSD and unused thicker (white) pad into the U-shaped piece. (You must leave the clear backing on unless you want the SSD to be permanently sandwiched.)5. Snap-in (as in, do not slide it in) the heatsink from the top.6. Remove the U-shaped piece by sliding it out. The top heatsink should be stuck in place. (You should probably let the glue cure for a few hours, but I had no issues doing it this way.)"", '☑️ As described and as advertised.☑️ Easy to fit with good instructions with heat sync etc.☑️ Standard sizing so no compatibility issues.☑️ Test fine with windows 11 but also fine for use with PS5.☑️ Decent capacity but the 1TB looks better value.☑️ Great for external Ssd enclosure.☑️ Good speeds and feeds for normal read/write usage patterns', 'With this piece of hardware nestled snugly inside my PC, loading times for all my applications have been reduced to nearly nonexistent. I found myself smiling with the seamless transition between scenes in my favourite video games. A noteworthy aspect is its suitability for the PS5, effectively expanding its storage capacity. The heatsink kept the temperature low, even during high-intensity tasks. One thing that caught my attention was the prolonged durability and stability, well-tested in various aspects. However, the installation process needed some precision. Nonetheless, the noticeable speed and reliability made this a worthy part\xa0of\xa0my\xa0setup.', ""I recently got this SSD for my PC, and it's been a fantastic upgrade! The Gen4 speeds are seriously impressive, making everything on my computer feel much faster. You will need a Gen4 compatible board to take advantage of the full speeds though.The installation process was really straightforward. It fits perfectly into my motherboard, and the heatsink it comes with helps keep it cool during intense tasks.I've used it for gaming, video editing, and handling large files, and it's been handling everything like a champ. The dynamic SLC cache feature is a nice touch, ensuring smooth performance even during heavy workloads.One cool thing is that it's also compatible with PS5, so if you have one, you can use it to expand your console's storage and enjoy faster load times in games.Overall, I'm thrilled with this and i is a solid performer with easy installation, and it's made a noticeable difference in my computer's speed and responsiveness and is much cheaper than the big brands."", 'This was ordered to go in an external enclosure to write to and eventually archive home video.Straight out of the box, there were no issues encountered with formatting and I am impressed with the read/write speeds. I may try and use this as a boot drive to run legacy software that has become far too expensive to upgrade and the capacity of this - albeit smaller than most on the market nowadays - should be ideally suited to it. It is a good size to house phone backups too. Just need to triple check that I will not lose anything in the process :-) The heatsink is a good addition but not used yet as still testing and it will depend on how heavy the editing will be, (which will be minimal due to time constraints).So far, so good and I will update here if I find any problems as a boot drive - should I go down that route.', ""I only have a PCIE x 3 slot on my motherboard. Claimed speeds were 2650MB/s write. Similar to the attached photo's which is fine.  Read peaked close to 3500MB/s which is probably the maximum you get for a PCIE x 3 slot.Installing the heatsink was very confusing (to me) from the description. I ended up putting just one thermal pad on and it worked fine.Tested with HD Tune Pro (200GB read/write) it didn't go over 45C. In a PC not a laptop.Bit expensive I think for a 512GB NVME £33.99.  You can get a 1TB drive..the same model for around £42."", ""My plan with this solid state drive is to replace the 128Gb NVMe stick in my laptop with this device which is four times the size. However, this requires duplication of the main drive which needs appropriate software and access to both drives at once. In the meantime I'm using this as an external backup device via an external housing.As with any new drive, it required partitioning and formatting, which was very quick and simple to do via my windows 10 laptop. Once plugged in via an external USB-C socket I was pleasantly surprised at the transfer rates, which were around 150MBs. Whilst way down on what it would be expected to achieve if installed directly, it's significantly faster than any of the USB memory sticks I've tested recently, typically by 10 times.It ships well packaged with plenty of thermal pads and a pretty substantial heatsink. Whilst it does get a little warm in use there's no great concerns over the temperature curve. Despite being hammered by multiple Gb of transfers it didn't heat up more than a few degrees.At £34 for 476Gb of usable space this is well priced."", 'This m.2 drive comes in a retail cardboard box and inside you’ll find the m.2 drive, screwdriver, 1x riser screw, heatsink, and 4x heatsink pads. The M.2 drive is lightweight and is a PCIe Gen 4 SSD. The Gen 4 standard doubles the amount of available bandwidth over gen3 and can give you a top speed of 4 GB/s per lane. This drive can be used in a Gen 2/3/5 slot with no issues, advantages, or disadvantages. Installation is straight forward and can be installed within a minute. I didn’t use the included heatsink and pads as my motherboard already has one which lies on top of all of my M.2 drives but it’s really easy to attach the heatsink with a pad if needed. Read and write tests give a sequential read speed of 5033MB/s, write speed of 2533MB/s, and a random read speed of 546MB/s. I’m quite impressed with the results of this given the price point and it has the advantage of being NVME which gives it a speed boost. I was able to completely fill the SSD to its maximum capacity which was 476GB after Windows 11 was installed on it. As a boot drive, it is extremely fast and Windows boots within a couple of seconds after the BIOS screen has done its checks. Overall, this is the perfect size to be used as a boot drive and you’ll get the best advantage this way as Windows can boot so fast and explorer windows pop up immediately within the OS as it makes it so much snappier. If you’re using an old mechanical or 2.5” SSD, and you have a m.2 slot available, definitely upgrade to this as you’ll see a big increase in speed.']"

It may look like a sata adapter but it is NOT and will not fit a sata cable. The device itself does work though. It provides you with the screw to attach your NVMe drive to this. It does not come with any kind of heat sink nor would you really be able to have it placed on this. Regardless, it is open so it does not confine your NVMe drive and cause it to overheat. That being said, it is pretty easy to install and adjust. The drives I had on end worked fine. I did not have any issues with the drive not detecting. It does have mounting points on the edges that make it easy to fit in SSD slots. The actual frame is okay. It is sturdy so you do not have to worry about the device breaking during install or anything. It is pretty secure. The port itself is well built. You do not have to worry about the pads coming off or breaking. It does utilize the drive speed well. I had no issues with that.  It did not have any issues with connecting or detecting the drive. Overall this device has worked out pretty well. I am pretty happy with it and it works for what I need it do. I do wish it has a bit more as I feel this is a bit barebone. Regardless, it is still well built and does the job.', 'This is a quite barebones M.2 PCIe to U.3 adapter. The adapter does work—I was able to use a M.2 SSD through the interface provided by the card, and the data transfer speeds were about as fast as I expected—and the dimensions are correct for installation in a standard 2.5” hard drive slot.Although it does its job well, the adapter is physically quite barebones. The metal edges are quite rough and sharp in some spots and the NVMe drive is very stably attached or protected (i.e. something could easily press on the NVMe drive and bend it). The circuit board similarly is not very well-supported by the mounting brackets and has plenty of flex.And just a reminder: this adapter is NOT SATA compatible—regular SATA cables are physically incompatible with the U.3 interface.Other than that, this product does a good job of being an adapter, although it is a bit spartan on its construction. Would recommend to anyone looking for a quick way to adapt their M.2 SSD to a U.3 connection.', ""The Ableconn IU3-DT132 M.2 NGFF to U.3 Adapter has been a practical addition to my tech arsenal. It does a fine job in converting an M.2 PCIe 4.0 x4 NVMe SSD to a 2.5-inch U.3 SFF-TA-1001 SSD drive.Performance-wise, it delivers exactly what you'd expect from a SATA port. While it won't reach NVME speeds through SATA, it still provides a functional solution to utilize M2 or NVME in the space of a SATA drive. So, if you're seeking a flexible, space-saving solution without expecting a speed miracle, this adapter fits the bill."", 'I would love to give this a great review but the adapter on the back requires an additional piece to make this work. I plan on still trying to get this to work with an adapter since the connector is not a common one. I falsely assumed this would allow me to use an NVME inside any of my older mini Hard drive enclosures where my old Disk version died yet the controller and everything else was fine. Once I find a solution I will update this as Im very curious on making this work. Just a bit of warning it uses a different kind of SATA connector that took me a bit to find.', ""This adapter works great when you need to test a U.3 connection or for using an M.2 for a basic boot drive. Keep in mind that M.2 is not designed for hot plug use, this adapter doesn't change that fact. Simple to use product, and works without issue."", ""Good way to add cheap consumer grade M.2 NVME drives to U.3 systems. This keeps the drive at PCIe 4.0 x4 speed as well as allowing to be hot-swappable. This adapter is simple to use, because you only have to install the M.2 drive in it. I'd recommend a thin heatsink for the drive or at least make sure you have good airflow over the drive to help it maintain full performance."", ""A quick problem solver adapter as long as you don't need the large capacity of a real U.3 drive. If you don't know that you need U.3, don't order this adapter. You won't have anything that it can plug in to, as U.3 is technically tri-mode SATA signaling compatible, but it uses a very different connector from a standard consumer hard drive. I don't know if it even has the SATA data lines wired up. This adapter does one thing, and it does it right. It takes a M.2 NVMe PCIe module, and puts it in a U.3 caddy. I put a PCIe Gen4 2280 length M.2 SSD in it, and as far as I can tell it is allowing the M.2 drive to max out to its top speed. About the same speed as that SSD can do when plugged directly into a motherboard, or plugged into a passive PCIe slot adapter.""]"

I also like the look of this enclosure; it has a textured design, a dark grey color and clean lines. This presents an industrial design -- quite trendy at the moment and one I quite like. It merits a strong recommendation. You can't beat it for the ten bucks asked."", 'This isn’t the fastest drive, but it’s a good value for storage.

I didn’t have any issues with bad video and the files transfer fairly quickly.', 'I put the TOPESEL SATA III SSD 2.5"", 512GB ssd in an external usb 3.0 enclosure and promptly formatted it to exFat from my Mac. I then tried to copy ~300 GB of data to it. It got about 3/4 of the way done then stopped with a unexpected error. I opened the drive to see what had been copied. Well, I could not access any of the files and the disk kept ejecting. I reformatted it again to exFat and copied about half as many files and it did fine. I\'m not sure I can blame the drive itself, but I am a bit weary now. It seems fine and maybe it was the electronics in the enclosure and not the drive? Disk utility does report the capacity as 511.9 GB so that\'s good. I\'m giving it three stars for now, but will update if it remains stable.']"

Overall this is a good solid state if you are on a budget or just want to upgrade an older drive. It has a good amount of memory. The write/read speed is not bad and it works pretty well. It boots up my operating system without much issue. The SSD memory (in my opinion) the minimum you should have for most computers which is just some basic software and storage. For day to day use, this is a good choice for a cheaper price. If you are looking for something for gaming, this drive will work but 480 gb is going to get filled up pretty quick with game sizes these days. Also supports drive cloning if you have the right software.', 'I needed to move my boot drive on my TrueNAS from a flash drive to a SSD. This drive fit the bill perfectly. I was able to use the backup of my config file and run an upgrade on the new SSD. All went flawlessly and I am back in business. This is an excellent choice for a boot drive for a TrueNAS server. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to get off of the USB flash drive boot or to repair a broken system with a good backup of your config file.', 'good price and arrived fast. set up was easy, just popped it in and formatted it.', 'Perfect!', 'I wouldn\'t bother comparing it to high end SSD\'s. But, if you have an older laptop, or even desktop, running an old slow harddrive, this is an inexpensive speedy upgrade. Leaps and bounds faster than my \'old\' laptop harddrive. Quite a bit faster than even my high end desktop 3.5"" harddrives. Would get absolutely smoked by a high quality SSD or NvMe drive. Reliability is unknown, so make sure to keep a good backup of any critical files (or just clone the drive to a disc image), but to date, I have zero complaints.', 'I got this as a gift for someone who plays a lot of newer games and after testing, The speeds are accurate within about 20mbps up or down and games run ok at 2k on ultra settings and great at 2k on high settings. (PC: Acer predator Triton 500 SE).I installed it as an external ssd with a sata to usb3.1 case and it runs great.My only complaint is that the hard drive cant be ejected until it goes into sleep mode.', 'I received this very quickly but no help on installing or cloning. Amizon help suggesting AOMEI for the installation but I was not able to setup so I returned it. I then purchased a Western Digal SSD but same problem then I found Mini Tool Partition/Shadow program and had it setup to clone in minutes. In short the first was most likely a very good SSD.', 'I ordered this SSD because my old Samsung one died. Delivery was fast and safe. The SSD runs just as quick and has 0 issues. Will definitely order from them again for my other computer.', 'Packaging was very clean and well . I must note there is no sata cable but those are inexpensive. My computer initially had trouble booting but that’s likely my computer and not the ssd. After I got it booted . It’s been fine since and the ssd preforms quickly and efficiently!', 'This product worked like a charm, I would recommend it to everyone...']"

They took over the Intel NAND business, making really good use of that Intel NAND in their P41 model. As of this review, a 2TB P41 is five less than what I paid for a 1TB P44. But to be clear, this P44 carries SK Hynix controller and NAND. I don't know, my ego wants at least the faster even at the expense of double capacity.Gen4 doesn't matter to my workload. But why not if my laptop supports it? I don't push anything for heat problems to occur. I do want consistent reliable performance though. SK Hynix is vertically integrated, much like WD and Samsung, so they can quality-control the whole stack tightly. Samsung's 980 Pro has both had its round of issues and also carries a premium because they built that mindset into consumers. Don't be like that. Frankly my next option would either be the Solidigm P41 Plus for capacity purposes; or WD SN770 or another P44 Plus (the SK Hynix Platinum 41 still carries a big premium also) for consistency.  It's not a must-buy but you won't have second doubts about performance with this drive. Capacity, sure, wondering if $5 more for half is worth the numbers. But that can be solved with a subsequent drive purchase.Packaging came in a small box, a paper box, and plastic. No tiny screw, no heatsink. Drops right in. I didn't install the optional driver or software but there's some potential gains to be had with that. I don't ever expect to ever claim a warranty on any tech thing but the website looks reliable enough to actually submit a support request.Update: I added some benchmarks testing 2GB files, pretty much the largest single chunk limit in my work. One is on battery, my laptop caps everything at Gen3 speeds; plugged in is Gen4 as fast as it goes. There’s a bunch of things that determine sustained speed over heavy writes but at 1TB capacity, the threshold is around 200GB before slowing down. Most people aren’t moving that 24/7 nor should they given the expected DWPD for consumer drives. For a detailed review, Tom’s Hardware tested both 1TB and 2TB models."", ""After a sudden and painful failure with Samsung 980 PRO 2TB, about which you can read around the web, I was searching for another strong and reliable SSD and found this. I don't really care about the synthetic speed tests, I just wanted a reliable SSD. Currently there are no complaints. Why I choose exactly this SSD, can be read on the reviews."", 'Non fatevi ingannare dal nome sconosciuto e strano. Si un marchio nuovo se si può dire così, però fino poco tempo fa , a costruire i ssd Intel erano loro. Praticamente è un Sk Hynix platinum p41 ,una garanzia essendo una delle poche compagnie al mondo che tutti i componenti vengono fatti a casa, insieme con Samsung e crucial.Se vi interessano le prestazioni sapete che il primo posto in assoluto se la gioca con il Samsung 990 pro, su qualche test è più veloce uno su altro e viceversa. In ogni caso il primo posto è occupato da questi due, il resto dei gia veloci gen4 seguono con una certa distanza.Personalmente ero sempre Samsung fan boy per quello che riguarda i ssd, però questa volta ho scelto questo ssd, motivo? I 990 pro hanno avuto un grave problema che portava ad una usura precoce del ssd stesso con impossibilità di recuperare. Samsung ha rilasciato un aggiornamento sostenendo di aver risolto il problema, ma sarà vero? Non volevo rischiare, a volte certi prodotti nascono male. Poi come garanzia siamo a 5 anni, come Samsung , però qui c’è più elevato tbw e non da poco. E per ultimo come efficienza energetica è il migliore in assoluto tra tutti i ssd nvme di gen4 attualmente in commercio—-meno calore prodotto più longevità del ssd.Da aggiungere che ha una applicazione per gestire il ssd,update firmware, controllo usura e temp etc. Nota importante è l’unica compagnia che rilascia un driver proprietario e non viene usato il solito driver generico di Windows che usano il resto dei ssd!Non fatevi ingannare dal nome strano, qui c’è un driver di qualità eccellente', 'Excellent value for money, easy to install and get working.

Good value for the $."", 'excelente producto calidad-precio muy buena invenrsion', ""This drive has been an absolute game-changer for me, solving my storage challenges with its blazing-fast speed and dependable performance.First and foremost, the read/write speeds of up to 7000MB/s and 6500MB/s are simply mind-blowing. I no longer have to wait for ages to transfer files or load large applications. It's like lightning in a drive, providing a seamless experience for my day-to-day tasks.The 3D NAND technology utilized in this SSD ensures efficient storage capacity and durability. I feel confident that my important files and data are safe and secure. The PCIe Gen 4 NVMe 4.0 x4 interface further enhances the overall performance, delivering a significant boost in speed.One aspect to consider is the form factor of the drive. The M.2 2280 size is compact and convenient, fitting perfectly into compatible systems. However, it's important to double-check if your motherboard supports this specific form factor before purchasing.In conclusion, the Solidigm™ P44 Pro Series 2TB SSD is a top-notch storage solution that exceeded my expectations. Its lightning-fast speed, reliable performance, and ample storage capacity make it a great choice for anyone seeking a significant upgrade to their system. Just remember to ensure compatibility with your motherboard's form factor requirements."", ""Overall, this is a pretty solid drive, speeds are as advertised.The performance of this drive is competitive to other name brands out there, however the others have better read/write speeds for the same price nearly the same price or a little bit more, although, its not a huge difference in speed to other NVMe SSDs. It depends what niche you want to use the faster read/write speeds for, that'll determine your decision in buying a fast storage. For most people, this is fast enough. It also has DRAM cache which makes the drive faster at reading and retrieving data, higher end SSDs usually have that. Gen4 NVMe SSDs providing Gen4 speeds, pretty sweet :)Personally, there isn't anything that pulls me to buy this over other SSDs like samsung or other name brands. My advice is to go with whatever is on sale you don't have to spend an absurd amount of money for a NVMe storage. You would probably lean towards this drive if you like investing in a new and different parts.Interestingly, Solidgm is a subsidiary of SK Hynix so these SSDs are like a SK Hynix clone I suppose. Intel had sold their SSD/NAND business to SK Hynix and then made Solidgm which has people from both Intel and SK Hynix. If that matters to anyone.I am pretty satisfied with the product and would probably purchase another one as I have no complaints on the performance. Hopefully we can continue to see something great with Solidgm in the future."", 'Super schnelle Ssd Festplatte für Ps5 und schnelle Lieferung von Amazon.']"

Is it?  In a word:  Yes!First a little discussion - this is very much a gaming-focused SSD, complete with new custom firmware and an extremely quick controller.  The custom firmware is based on Phison\'s I/O+ which Sabrent calls O2GO.  It is ideal for gaming, especially for DirectStorage (more on which in a minute).Now, it goes without saying (or it should, anyway) that this is a Gen 4 drive, and a realistic test/review would be using this on a Gen 4 system.  Even in an enclosure is a bit of an imprecise test, since there\'s so much in a USB-C chain that has to be correct.  The version of the USB (Gen 1, or today called USB Gen 3.1) limits you to 5Gbps, which is well below what this drive is capable of.  The enclosure itself also needs to support the SSD Gen 4.  And so on.  It WILL work in a Gen 3 system, but you won\'t get advertised speeds.Anyway.  First things first.  I couldn\'t care less about the box it comes in.  I couldn\'t care less about the fancy sticker.  Put it in a brown cardboard box for all I care.  Whatevs.Now, a word about DirectStorage.  It\'s a new API that\'s coming to Windows 11, but it\'s important to realize that it isn\'t released yet.  So what we have here is a drive that WILL take advantage of DS 1.1 when it\'s released, and that has some interesting (and exciting) implications for DirectStorage SSDs.Installation is simple, no pitfalls.  I will say though that while Sabrent ""recommends"" the use of a heatsink, the reality is that one is very much required.  This generates heat, and heat diminishes the speed of the drive.  The system itself is also a constraint (a thin laptop has a harder problem with thermals than a large case with lots of space for air circulation).  But, that out of the way....We\'re talking serious speed here.  With all the constraints and such as mitigated as possible, I got 7Gbps sequential read and a bit over 6Gbps sequential write (see screenshot).  While this is a bit below advertised speeds, it\'s not THAT much lower, and frankly if I tinkered more it would likely get up there.  This is with the SSD directly on the motherboard (not an enclosure) with a fully modern Gen 4 slot and a fairly decent (but not league-leading) heatsink.So yes - in the words of Han Solo...she\'s fast enough for you, old man.Again though, to hammer home the point...without the requisite hardware and cooling...the drive\'s performance is wasted.Now then - I have two drives in my system, the other being a Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus.  I\'ll say that they are mostly comparable (both have the newer 176 layer TLC) and raw speeds are generally comparable.  To my way of thinking, the differences (besides $10 in the price as of this writing) is the O2GO firmware that optimizes this drive for gaming, or really anything that requires really rapid calls for high-end PCs.  It\'s a waste for a gaming console, but for an upper tier gaming rig...this is fantastic.Last word on this rather lengthy review (and thanks for sticking with me here).  After installation you really want to go to Sabrent\'s website and download a couple of things.  First is the Sabrent Rocket Control Panel - this, despite looking like a basic rebadged version of Samsung Magician, will be the way you update firmware, monitor temperatures, and so on.  The second is to download Acronis, which is a very handy tool provided by Sabrent for things like disk cloning (very handy if this is replacing a boot drive...). Both are free.So that\'s it.  From where I sit, this offers performance that fits well in high end gaming computers, along with a very clear upgrade path with DirectStorage.  Any consideration to the prettiness of the box is facile at best...what\'s important is how it works, and this one....works very well.', ""Ne ho diversi da un pò di anni e finora non mi hanno mai mollato a differenza di uno di un'altra marca che di punto in bianco ha deciso di mollarmi dopo pochi anni."", 'Great NVME SSD, very quick and plenty of storage capacity at a good price.', 'so far excellent performance', 'I started buy another one and decided to.try this one.

I actually used this to upgrade my older macbook. This works pretty well if you are looking for fast speed on a budget. One thing to note is that windows takes up at least 1/3 of the drive. There is not much space. The drive has the same physical size as a 2.5 drive. It has the same aluminum casing that most solid states drive so it is unfortunately prone to scratches. This drive works for both mac and PC without any issues.It had no issues with detecting the drive. I did not have to install any additional software and it was just a plug in play for both Mac and PC. As always, the drive need to be initialized before it can be used. If you are doing a fresh install, it will do it for your in the setup. Before installation, I tried it in a 3.0 enclosure and the transfer speed is not bad. I did not have a 3.1 drive enclosure to test for that. The solid state drive did get warm in the enclosure but it cools off pretty quick. The same occurred when it was installed in my computer. I also did a memory verification just to be safe and the storage memory is correct so you can be sure your data is safe. When plugging it into my computer and doing a speed test on the device, it was reading closer to 450 MB/s which is great. There was no huge discrepancy to me because there could be a variety of reason it is not hitting the max speed. Also I do not really notice the difference in speed to be alarmed. It still has a good boot speed. When I tried this with my MAC, it ran pretty well. It did not have any issues with connection or installation (same goes for windows). I ran with this solid state drive and boot up was very good. It is not as fast as an m2 drive but it still pretty quick. I ran it against some other 2.5 solid state drives (Samsung and WD) as well as the Seagate Hybrid drive and it about average in terms of speeds. It is not top of the line, but decent if you are looking to maybe upgrade your media computer or an older mac mini. I actually used this to update my parents desktops as they still ran on disk drive. I tested the drive on both mac and windows and windows seem to show a faster speed than mac. I honestly do not know why this is. Overall this is a good solid state if you are on a budget, but it is definitely like the extreme bare minimum storage size. It is only 120 gb and that will fill up super fast. If you are going to use this, I would recommend it only for OS and some small software. The write/read speed is not bad. It boots up my operating system without much issue. For day to day use, this is a good choice for a cheaper price. If you are looking for something for gaming, then you may need to look for a faster drive. Also supports drive cloning if you have the right software.', ""If you have spent any time reading up on SSD performance, you'll no doubt have seen a consistent trend that the bigger the SSD, the faster it performs. That's due in part to the fact that larger drives have more NAND flash modules that can be read and written to at the same time. So more flash more fast. Now, with this particular 120 GB drive, I'm sure there are not a lot of flash modules onboard (I didn't take it apart to check), but it doesn't mean it's not quick. You can see from the the included pics, Crystal Disk Mark has this drive performing quite well.....at it's brand new empty state. For those not in the SSD know, you never, NEVER want to fill one up completely. The rule of thumb is about 75%. That will keep it performing well, otherwise it can be as slow as an old spinning drive. The only problem with this drive is that Windows alone takes a massive chunk for itself, leaving little room for programs and unless you play games from 10-15 years ago only, no room for many, if any modern games.So what is the best use case for this particular drive then? A PC or laptop that still could benefit from a huge speed boost that is never really used for much other than surfing the net, or doing your basic office tasks. Or because it's cheap and decently quick, you could get one for a game that you would like to have load quicker, but doesn't take up hundreds of Gigabytes of space. Small drives like this are not practical in todays age if you are into playing games, but are still excellent for breathing new life in old computers and a actual affordable prices for almost everyone."", 'As of the time of this review, you can get this SSD for $9.00 which is incredibly cheap. Mine had slower speeds than some of the other reviews, but for the price, it is well within the acceptable range. If you need a drive to install windows, play games, or install non-critical files, this is a great option that you should consider.']"

I'm not very Bios and computer savvy, and I did run into some problems, and would like to explain what these problems are.This is a great hard drive (I will explain why in a second). I bought the 2 tb gen 3 version because my Asus motherboard (PRIME Z490-A) only supports gen 3 and not gen4. Gen 4 would work on the motherboard; however, I would not benefit from the increased speeds of a gen4. I know this, because my main M.2 drive with windows 10 on it is a gen 4 and it is not as fast as this Team group gen 3.My pc for the last few months had been running sluggishly. Thumbnails in folders with lots of graphics were loading slowly, and that horrible green line forming from left to right in Windows explorer was annoying. Moreover, my main drive which was a 1tb was getting rather full so I decided to buy this team group drive. Upon receiving the drive, I placed it into an Nvme external drive enclosure and cloned my internal C drive using Macrium reflect, a free software used for disk clones. The operation went smoothly, however, when using crystal disk mark, I noticed that my drive read and write speeds were very low or about half, on both the main M.2 and this new team group as well. My PC is clocked at 5-5.2 GHz, so something was not right.I spent a whole day researching this problem on the internet, and nobody really offered a real solution to the problem. The first thing is to check drive temperatures and mine were perfect around 40-45c. So, bad read and write speeds was not a throttling heat problem. This team group hard drive runs pretty cool, even without a heatsink or thermal strip. It turns out there are a few things we need to do in the BIOS to ensure these drives work at max capacity.First of all, I know this will sound stupid, (AND IT HAPPENED TO ME). When looking into your bios, imagine your BIOS page to be really TALL. Almost certainly you cannot see all the options without scrolling all the way down the page. I know this is silly, but in the advanced section of my Bios I could only see about 14 options on the left side, and the option I needed onboard device configuration is way under that.  You need to find this onboard function is any bios, not just the Asus bios and you need to set your M.1 and M.2 slots at full speed, other wise your Nvme drives are going to function at half the read and write rates.Once I made these changes both drives started reading at full speed. (crystaldisk mark is the software you need). My other drive is an older Corsair gen 4 drive with heatsink 9I paid a fortune for this 2 years ago), and it is not nearly as fast as this teamgroup, which went a little above 3500 mb/s.In a nutshell, so many people online complain that they are getting half the speeds with their Nvme drives, and do not know why. The answer is in your Bios! It’s not drivers, it’s not having your Sata devices enabled or disabled in the Bios, It’s not choosing between GEN1 GEN 2 GEN3 AND GEN 4 in the Bios. It’s simply the ONBOARD FUNCTIONS in the AVANCED area of the bios, which is down about 14-16 items in the list. You have to set your M.1 and M.2 SPEEDS ACCORDINGLY."", 'I wish it came with a screw but overall it worked right out of the box. Phison E12 and 4TB of TLC. I ran a benchmark using Samsung Magician and the sequential read/write are respectable and within the claimed range. They\'re not intended to saturate your PCI-Express bus with data but if you need a large capacity data archive and you can\'t have a 3.5"" or 2.5"" disk; then this is probably your next best. TBH, this is probably cheaper than a 4th 2.5"" SSD; faster, too.', 'I checked the chips myself after it arrived in the mail. It does in fact have a DRAM cache: a Nanya DDR3 chip. From what I have read online, this SSD can come with NAND flash and controllers from a few different companies, but all of them do seem to be legit, just different revisions. They all seem to perform roughly the same, and all have the Nanya DDR3 cache. Good deal for the money. An equivalent SSD from Samsung (2TB with DRAM) would be the SAMSUNG 980 PRO, and that costs $119 as of writing this review. That makes this SSD a $45 savings if you are willing to deal with the PRC state-owned companies that make some of the chips and negligibly slower speed (does not matter for almost any home/gaming user). It should also be noted that Teamgroup themselves are a Taiwanese (ROC) company, so I am not especially concerned about a few PRC state-owned company chips, as a Taiwanese company has almost certainly done their due diligence to vet the chips properly. Overall, an excellent SSD for most gaming or home users looking to save a buck! 9/10. -1 for my dislike of the PRC/CCP state-owned company affiliated chips.', ""Using with an Acasis TBU405 enclosure, definitely not 40Gbps but fast enough for my needs and no issues when checking the SMART status with DriveDX.I guess if I had more money than I knew what to do with I'd get the premium brands, but I don't and this has delivered wonderfully for the price.Sitting idle at 38C, after 10 minutes of BlackMagic testing with 4GB files it's up to 44C."", ""I just bought 5 of these drives for future use in the Asustor Flashstor 12 to test and leaving my initial findings. I've only tested in the Acasis 40Gbps thunderbolt enclosure that I've been using for Samsung 980 Pro cards where Blackmagic reports 2600MB/s write 2400MB/s read on the Samsung 980. This is by no means a scientific benchmark, just some ad-hoc testing to see if they'll be a fit for use in the Flashstor 12. No heatsink was used in testing.All 5 cards reported the same results and none were DOA. AmorphousDiskMark was reporting ~1700MB/s sequential read and ~1550MB/s sequential write. Blackmagic Disk Speed Test was reporting ~1400MB/s write and ~1600MB/s read. Sustained writes were good and tested with a 280GB transfer that averaged about 800MB/s. Each transfer started at ~1500MB/s and a minute later dropped down to ~900MB/s and a minute following it fluctuated on a regular internal between 300-900MB/s.So far it looks good for Flashstor use and will likely never see these numbers due to the implementation limitations of the Flashstor device (minimal PCI lanes available). The low price, good sustained write speed and high TBW are giving me a little more confidence given this is not (yet or maybe never will be) listed as officially compatible with the Flashstor."", 'This is a good drive either for your main computer or a NAS.

Diese sollten als Gaming und eine als Videoschnitt Platten dienen.Verbaut in einem NXZT H9 Flow Gehäuse mit AIO und insgesamt 10 Lüftern ARGB von Artic. Es sind meine ersten PCIE 5.0 M2 SSD, zuvor nur 4.0 genutzt, da 5.0 einfach immer zu teuer war, die Auswahl gering und die Hardware es nicht konnte.Beim Preis von ca. 130 Euro dann aber zugeschlagen.Da Samsung ja dieses Jahr im Netz zerlegt wurde wegen dem Sterben der Platten, diese nutzten sich zu schnell ab. Die neue Firmware soll da Abhilfe geschaffen haben, ich will es hoffen.Atemberaubende Geschwindigkeit: Lese-/Schreibgeschwindigkeiten bis zu 7.450 / 6.900 MB/s  2 TB Variante.Das gibt der Hersteller an und ich kann das bestätigen, siehe Screenshots.  Beide Platten haben den gleichen Wert, da bin ich begeistert, weil ich eigentlich gewohnt bin etwas weniger zu bekommen.Die Temperaturen auf dem zweiten Bild sind während des Testes entstanden, also beim Benchmark nur 41 Grad sind echt gut. Gute Kühlung natürlich vorausgesetzt und einen passenden Heatsink des Boards oder den Originalen.Zur Info: Bei PCI Express 4.0 waren es bis zu 8 GB/s auf 4 Lanes, dabei erreichten die schnellsten NVMe-SSDs ca. 7.000 MB/s im Lesen und ca. 5.000 MB/s im Schreiben, sodass bei Flash-Laufwerken mit PCIe 5.0 maximale Geschwindigkeiten von etwa 14.000 MB/s im Lesen und 10.000 MB/s im Schreiben realistisch sind.Das bedeutet natürlich dass man für die maximale Geschwindigkeit auch die passende CPU/Mainboard benötigt, um das Tempo überhaupt zu bekommen. Ich habe mir einige Bewertungen durchgelesen, da wird immer nur an 4.0 angeschlossen, dann kann man vielleicht die lese Geschwindigkeit nutzen, aber nicht das Schreiben ausreizen.  Das ist dann verschenktes Potenzial.Leider reizt die 990 Pro den PCIE 5.0 Anschluss auch nicht aus, aber das ist auch Ok, da solche Platten momentan um die >300€ kosten und auch die erst ca. 12000 MB/s können.Fazit:Eher etwas für Enthusiasten also für den Otto Normalo, in Spielen merkt man keinen Unterschied zu meiner WD Black 770 M2 SSD PCIE4.0 oder den normalen Sata6 SSDs.Im Videoschnitt Bereich soll das angeblich etwas bringen, das muss ich noch testen.PCIE 4.0 SSDs bekommt man häufig für 70-80 Euro, die reichen eigentlich völlig aus. Momentan würde ich eher den meisten raten noch zu warten, bevor man auf den 5.0er Zug aufspringt.Ob das in Spielen zukünftig anders wird, bleibt abzuwarten. Da aber dank der schnellen PS5 Festplatte etwas Schwung in den Markt kommt, bleibt nur zu hoffen.Vielen Dank für das Lesen der Bewertung und ich wünsche jedem viel Spaß mir diesem tollen Stück Technik.PS: Über den Daumen hoch würde ich mir natürlich freuen :)', 'Había tenido ya dispositivos de almacenamiento interno de la marca, pero no en este formato con muy buenos resultados, así que al tener la oportunidad y con un precio inmejorable, hice la compra sin pensarlo, dos veces.

Note that I don\'t think that the NVME gives you the performance you\'d see say in a normal computer.

You can search for Jeff Geerling\'s review on this to see what I mean.I personally use this to house my Home Assistant install. I didn\'t want the volatility of sd card storage, and thought at first this would at least let me put the ""data"" portion of my install on SSD. I then found out that rPi 4s can natively boot off of usb (which is how this product connect to the pi). Its out of the scope of this review to set up you pi for usb boot, but it\'s not hard and can be done using the raspberry pi image flasher tool. There are a few tutorials out there for this.Another thing to note is that this does support TRIM, which you will want to turn on, but it\'s not on by default. This was a bit more difficult for me to set up because Home Assistant OS is stripped down and it was a bear to get all the tools needed to do it. If you aren\'t using Home Assistant, or even if you are (though it won\'t be as helpful), Jeff Geerling does have a tutorial on his site about how to setup TRIM.

I wish it was a standard size so I could replace it with a noctua one not that I couldn\'t, but it\'s not an exact fit).

Me encanta.', 'Ich hatte mir erst das Gehäuse mit SATA M2 Interface gekauft, mechanisch ähnlich aber inkompatibel zu den neusten M2 SSD, welche es nur noch mit NVME Standard gibt. Mit der Erweiterung konnte das Gehäuse mit einer 1TB Samsung Pro M2 NVME SSD nutzen.', ""If you have the Argon One case, you just need the M.2 NVME SSD to really enjoy the Raspberry Pi 4. It's simple to get up and running. You need a M.2 NVME USB enclosure to format and send the Pi OS to the M.2 NVME SSD using Raspberry Pi Imager on a PC (I went with the Samsung EVO 512GB). To make the Pi 4 boot to this, you need to first use the Raspberry Pi Imager to use the SD Card (do NOT use NOOBS) to make the Pi 4 boot to USB. Once you have that, you will remove the SD card and then with the M.2 loaded with Pi OS 32bit (64 bit is not advised yet) which is also done with Pi Imager, you will remove the M.2 drive from the USB enclosure and install it into this Argon One NVME tray. It's literally as easy as that. There is NOTHING better !"", '==============================Caveats & Warnings:------------------------------This expansion is ONLY compatible with the ""V2"" version of the Argon One case.  You have the correct case version, if the case has cutouts for 2 full sized HDMI ports (see picture).------------------------------The SSD socket ONLY ACCEPTS SSD that are ""M"" keyed.  If your SSD is ""B+M"" keyed, DO NOT USE IT.------------------------------In order to provide enough current to operate an NVMe SSD, the board has a ""post"" THAT MUST MAKE CONTACT with a test point labeled ""TP2"" on the Raspberry Pi\'s main circuit board (see picture).  If you don\'t have a ""TP2"" in the correct spot; you might have a gray-market Pi.------------------------------The expansion board DOES SUPPORT UASP, BUT YOUR NVMe SSD MAY NOT (per ChatGPT).  Please see screenshot for evidence of UASP firmware support.------------------------------A magnetized screwdriver, and a magnetic tray or dish, is strongly recommended.==============================The ""default"" for the standoff and mount point of the SSD is at the 2280 position (see picture).  If you are using a smaller form factor, reposition the standoff NOW, and DO NOT LOSE THE MOUNTING SCREW.You know that you\'ve properly seated the SSD into the socket, when you can make it ""stand up"" in the socket; before locking down the SDD with the mounting screw (see picture).  Ensure the pins are correctly seated in the socket (see picture).Once you attach the expansion to the existing Argon One case; you will LOSE EXTERNAL ACCESS to the micro SD card slot.  If you plan to boot directly off the SSD, remove the SD card NOW.  Pi 4B whose EEPROM contain bootloaders dated 2021 or later, will boot off the SSD, if the SD card slot is empty.  If you want to change the boot order, or need to update your EEPROM, do it before proceeding.You can image your SSD, by connecting it directly to your PC, with a USB-A to USB-A cable.  The interface will show up as a USB device named ""AS2360,"" and the Pi Imager software will recognize the SSD as a USB SCSI drive; of the size that you mounted in the SSD socket.  Like the SD card; the Pi Imager will divide the SSD into 2 partitions of VFAT and EXT4.', 'RPi4 does not want to boot with either M.2 or NVME base without insulating spring-loaded gold pin.', ""This was a breeze to put together. Note that it surpluses the lower half of the Argon ONE V2. The screws that come with the M.2 NVME Expansion Board are a tad longer to get the same purchase on the upper half so don't reuse the ones from the original base."", 'Funciona sin problemas, es muy fácil de conectar y no requiere de ningún tipo de configuración especial.', 'I love the idea of adding an NVME drive to the Argon V2 case.  However, there the problem is that NVME drives are very power hungry and the PI4 internal regulator cannot keep up.  I tested with a 20W 5V 4A dedicated power supply with a USB-C linked power meter in-between to confirm that the power supply is not the limiting factor.  The issue is the LDO regulator on the PI4B cannot supply enough wattage to the NVME drive and the internal draw at the same time, resulting in ""under-voltage warnings"".  The EXT4 file system journal helps, but the end result is that file writes to the NVME drive are not stable and the writes sometimes will end up corrupted.  Thus, buyer beware: As neat as this expansion is, file writes are not stable due to lack of available power.']"

I actually formatted it and tried to run an a verify the capacity via h2test. I was not able to complete it as the device stopped working. It could not actually stay initialized. After I pulled the drive out and plug it back in, I have to reinitialize and reformat it. I cannot confirm if the storage capacity is correct and it is a genuine memory. This could be just a recycled drive. I am suspicious of it due to it having an OS already installed on it. Also it was just in a simple anti static bag. It also stopped working as intended after I formatted it once. Overall this is a M2 drive stopped working after one format. It already had an OS installed on it which makes me worried it was return or salvaged drive. It also was an M2 sata drive. I am pretty unhappy with this.']"

The laptop's original built-in 32GB SSD couldn't even run Windows 10, so I ditched Windows and installed Ubuntu Mate, which is fast and uses a fraction of the disk space. When I decided to go for more storage I chose the Western Digital Green 250GB SATA SSD, finding it very easy to install physically in the laptop and remarkably straightforward to set up.With the laptop switched off (of course) I opened the expansion cover on the underside (2 small screws) and took out the screw provided for securing the new SSD. The small circuit board easily went into place and was gripped firmly by the connector inside. I restarted the laptop after securing the SSD with the screw provided inside the expansion bay, and replacing the cover.The new unformatted SSD didn't appear on the desktop, so I opened the Ubuntu Settings menu, clicked Hardware/Discs and the new drive showed up immediately on the list.

I discovered the slot on my hard drive and did some reading. Yes, it's older technology and mainly designed at the time for disc cache. If Dell put them in they were very small capacity and setup that way. But they can be solid state drive and even used as your main boot drive. I cloned my old traditional hard drive to this one (only took 20 hours) but it works and instead of my computer taking 3-5 minutes to boot it now boots in less than a minute. My browser loads faster. My old 10 year desktop that I mostly use now as a media server is now so much less sluggish. This particular MSAT had decent reviews. I've read they fail much less than a spinning drive.

It may look like a sata adapter but it is NOT and will not fit a sata cable. That being said, the device itself does work pretty well. It is a simple device in terms of looks. It is not anything fancy and your U.3. drive is exposed. It provides you with the screw to attach your drive to this pretty easily. Do not screw it too tight or you could crack the board. It does not come with any kind of heat sink nor would you really be able to have it placed on this. Regardless, it is open so it does not confine your U.3 drive. You have plenty of airflow so long as this is not directly under your GPU drive. This fits pretty well and is able to detect without any issues. That being said, it is pretty easy to install and adjust. The drives I installed worked well and is pretty secure. The port is sturdy. The actual frame is okay. It just feels like a simple card you would install in the PCI slot. It is sturdy so you do not have to worry about the device breaking during install or anything. It is pretty secure once you have it screwed down to your case and in the port. The speed for the drive works pretty well through this. I do wish it had a black plate to match my case but that is okay. Overall this device has worked out pretty well. I would just say be aware this will not work for U.2 or SATA drives. It will only work for U.3 device. It works without the driver and for the most part is thin so you can fit it easily in your case.', ""This is a great card. It appears to be well manufactured and was shipped inside of thick cardboard box, wrapped in bubble wrap. I had to wait a few more days for the U3 NVME SSD I had also purchased to arrive. For anyone unfamiliar, U2/U3 NVME SSDs are hot swappable, run much cooler, and tend to come in higher capacities than those in the M2 formfactor. But U2/U3 connectors are usually only found in enterprise level stuff.Once it did, I had no problems installing it to this card, which thankfully came with installation screws as the new drive did not. I plugged it in to my desktop's motherboard and it booted fine. Any drivers were apparently native to Windows 10, I didn't need to install any. I have experienced absolutely no problems whatsoever from this product (or the attached SSD, knock on wood), anyone who's dealt with PC hardware more than just a few times knows that is not something you take for granted. It's disappointing to say the least when that new piece of tech you couldn't wait for just refuses to play nice with your PC.  If at some point I do have problems with this add-in card, I will make sure to update this review. This is a solid piece of hardware, just make sure it's actually what you need. I know I've been in hurry and failed to fully read a product listing only to find I actually ordered the wrong thing, more than just a few times.Just some things to note (and hopefully maybe prevent someone having any problems)-1. This card is PCIE 4 and is backwards compatible with PCIE 3, but no further. Only 4x lanes are needed.2. U2 drives will not work. The data pin-out is different.3. I may be wrong, but I don't think U3 offers any benefit over U2 to the home consumer. But U3 SSDs are harder to find and usually more expensive. All things equal, a U2 add-in card may be preferable (IF one is available)."", 'This will give any system the ability to use a U.3 drive, assuming you have a x4 PCIe 4.0 slot for maximum speed. Keep in mind that the U.3 connector is not backwards compatible with U.2. Great value for using new or used U.3 drives.', ""I put it in the PC in a Gen4.0 slot with a Gen4.0 drive, and everything auto-detected at the right 4x4.0 connection. I didn't find any remarkable speed difference between the adapter board and a direct connection, so I'd say everything works well. Being basically an interface changer board between two different connectors, there isn't that much to it. Use it to put high-capacity high-speed storage in a premium workstation PC, or use it to troubleshoot or pull data off of a single enterprise drive from a server or NAS. I like that it breaks out the activity status LED pins to a header to add an indicator light if your drive supports it."", ""PROs1. Adapter to upgrade your old PC motherboard to nvMECONS1. Pricey  $42 for just an adapter card. It's like double the price from other brands sold on amazon."", 'This U.3 to PCIe x4 adapter card was very simple to use and install. I simply had to insert my U.3 drive into the connector on the card then screw the drive down from the back side to secure it. After that, I installed it into my system. I am currently using it in a PCIe 4.0 x16 slot that is wired for x8. This slot allows me to get the full performance of the drive on the card and after some testing, I am able to get full performance. I get the same performance using this adapter as I get plugging the U.3 drive directly into a port on the motherboard. Very easy to use and simple to install. This can work well as a cache drive for NAS installations where you do not have any drive bays or M.2 slots available.', 'First, you need to know a U.3 SSD are usually used in high-end data centers, so with this board and a U3 SSD you can simulate a data center speed and capacity. The latest u3\'s are 30.72tb - a lot of data space. A standard SSD only can go up to 1/2 that. Speed wise you also improve your random read rates by up to 60% and random write rates 41%. Your actual read/write rates will depend upon the PCIe version the computer is running. They all have the same endurance life. While this board is very inexpensive be ready for the price of the U3 SSD is quite a bit more than the ""regular"" 2.5"" SSDs. But by doing so you\'ll have massive capacity and speed for your computer.']"

I found this annoying. Eventually it took about 10 unplugs and replug and some jiggling of the cable, or something, to get my computer or camera to recognise the drive. Given that I had spent nearly $300 on the Samsung 990 Evo Pro internal card, I decided to try a cheap alternative cover than this Zitay one. The cheap one ($39 Cruxtec M2 NVMe holder) worked perfectly from the get go, the cable can be unplugged and replugged and replaced safely, the drive mounts every time I turn my camera on without having to pull out the cable and re-plug.

Ich habe die SSD in einen Dell Notebook eingebaut und damit die von Werk aus vorhandene HD ersetzt. Zuvor habe ich diese geklont und entsprechend ausgerichtet (Sichtwort: ssd alignment).Die Dynon Metrics SSD läuft problemlos im Notebook und der Geschwindigkeitsgewinn hat es möglich gemacht wieder vernünftig mit dem Notebook arbeiten zu können. Als netter Nebeneffekt ist dieser auch etwas leiser geworden da es keine HD-Festplattengeräusche mehr gibt.Die Speicherkapazität der SSD ist auch ausreichend wenn man seine Daten auf dem NAS oder in der Cloud speichert.Fazit: sehr gute und preiswerte Upgrade-Alternative zum ansonst fälligen Kauf eines neuen Computers.', 'Heute starte ich einmal etwas anders. Die Firma Dynon Metrics ist eine in Seattle ansässige Firma die eigentlich im Bereich der biometrischen Technologie unterwegs ist. Mir war bis jetzt der Name Dynon Metrics nicht bekannt als SSD Hersteller.Nun aber zur SSD. Sie wird in einem kleinen Karton geliefert. Eine Anleitung oder Schrauben für die SSD sind nicht im Lieferumfang mit dabei. Es handelt sich bei dieser SSD um eine SSD im klassischen 2.5"" SATA Formfaktor.Ich habe auf der Webseite von Dynon Metrics geschaut, allerdings wenig technische Daten zu der SSD gefunden. Es ist nur angegeben, dass die SSD bis zu 500MB/s lesen und 450MB/s schreiben kann. Angaben über den Stromverbrauch, oder auch wie hoch die Gesamtschreibrate ist, habe ich nicht finden können. Das ist schade, denn es ist nicht unwichtig. Auch die verwendete Flash Technologie wird nicht erwähnt. Letztlich ist das aber alles wichtig für die Beurteilung.Ich habe die SSD in einem PC getestet, und konnte eine maximale Leserate von 552MB/s ermitteln, und eine Schreibrate von 394MB/s. Die Leserate ist wirklich nicht schlecht. Die Schreibrate könnte einwenig höher liegen für meinen Geschmack. Eine Samsung EVO 870 1TB SSD liegt bei 554MB/s Leserate und 495MB/s Schreibrate im Maximum.Der aktuelle Preis der Dynon Metrics 128GB SSD liegt bei knapp 43€, eine Crucial MX500 250GB CT250MX500SSD1 liegt aktuell bei um 40€. Man bekommt also fast das doppelte an Speicherkapazität für das selbe Geld.Ich habe auch den Eindruck, das die Dynon Metrics etwas hoch im Preis ist. Ich habe auch kein spezielles Freistellungsmerkmal finden können, das diesen Preis rechtfertigt. Leider schweigt sich Dynon Metrics über die SSD mehr oder weniger komplett aus was die technischen Daten oder Fähigkeiten angeht.Fazit:Die Geschwindigkeit der SSD ist soweit in Ordnung, es gibt allerdings durchaus schnellere SSDs. Der Preis für die SSD im Vergleich zu den Produkten der Mitbewerber recht hoch. Daher gebe ich 3 Sterne.', 'Mir ist nicht ganz klar, was der Vorteil der Dynon Metrics SSD Internal Hard Drive - 2.5"" SSD - SATA 128GB im Vergleich zu anderen Produkten dieser Kategorie sein soll. Mit 128 GB kann man heute niemanden mehr beeindrucken, schon vor zwei Jahren hatte ich meinen Laptop mit einer SSD 870 EVO 256 GB erweitert, welche zum damaligen Zeitpunkt noch doppelt so viel gekostet hatte. Heute bekommt man sie zum selben Preis wie diese SSD. Mit ihren 37 Gramm ist sie zwar etwas leichter, jedoch hat sie auch nur halb so viel Speicherplatz. Im privaten Bereich sind hohe Temperaturen bei SSD Speichern in der Regel kein Problem, weshalb dies auch kein Verkaufsargument ist. Die Lese- und Schreibwerte sind soweit im Rahmen.', 'Dynon Metrics ist ein Hersteller in Seattle Washington.SSDs sind Festplatten mit besserer Ladegeschwindigkeit, weshalb ich meine Spiele, wie zum Beispiel Assassins Creed oder Horizon auf diese SSD installiert habe.Die SSD bietet einen Speicherplatz von 128GB und wird sofort vom PC angezeigt. Sobald das Kabel steckt, ist die SSD einsatzbereit.Spiele laden im Vergleich zu anderen SSDs, wie zum Beispiel Samsung, genau gleich. Ich merke keinen bzw. nur geringeren Unterschied.Der einzige Minuspunkt, weshalb ich auch nur 4 Sterne vergebe, ist der Preis. Für den Preis kriegt man schon Festplatten mit mehr Speicherplatz. Trotzdem bin ich von der Festplatte überzeugt.', 'Die Dynon Metrics SSD wird in einem kleinen Karton ohne weiteres Zubehör wie Befestigungsschrauben geliefert. Eine Anleitung oder ein Datenblatt lag meiner Sendung ebenfalls nicht bei. Man bekommt hier eine interne SSD zum Einbau in PC oder Laptop im 2,5 Zoll SATA  Gehäuse geliefert.Konkrete technische Daten zu der SSD liegen mir leider nicht vor, allerdings habe ich feststellen können dass die Geschwindigkeit im erwartbaren Rahmen liegt, weder besonders schnell aber auch nicht wirklich langsam. Solides Mittelfeld also. Man bekommt hier eine durchaus brauchbare SSD, die meiner Meinung nach für die gebotene Speicherkapazität zu teuer ist. Mitbewerber bieten für den Preis bereits 256 GB.']"

For 128 gb, it is a bit overpriced considering you can get 256 gb for the same price. First thing I will say about this is that it does give a speed up boost but not as well as higher name brand SSD. I will say it works for a good boot up drive. Due to the smaller space, it does not have much storage space for a ton of stuff. It is a good replacement for an SSD or a dying hard drive but I would not buy this as an upgrade to another M2 drive as you can get something better for similar price with more memory. It is not the fastest on the market but I find it still works pretty well. This drive is still pretty fast. I am able to store maybe one game on it and my operating system. I actually just opted to only use this for my operating system and some other programs. I store my game on another drive. Like many M2 drives, this device does not come with the screw to screw it down into a motherboard. You either have to purchase that separately or you have one from the motherboard if you purchased that. Before purchasing this, you should make sure that you have an NVMe M.2 slot that you can plug this into. Be careful as not all the ports will be the same as some may look similar but have very different plugs. The temperature on this thing can get pretty warm on full use but nothing that is dangerous level. You could attach a heat sink to this if you want but it is not required. Also make sure you have proper air flow throughout your computer. I would say if you planning to have this device in an enclosure however that you make sure a heat sink on it to distribute the heat evenly and keep the drive cool. This device is pretty much plug and use although you will need to initialize and partition the drive. If you are cloning the drive, make sure you change the default on your bios to read the m2 drive once the cloning is complete. The boot up speed can be between six to eight seconds to boot up but it can vary. You can easily access file in a quicker speed and boot up (depending on if you install programs) is pretty quick. I store a few games on this drive and it is very quick speeds. It is pretty much instant boot up rather than that slight lag you get when loading from a disk drive. I did a speed test on the drive and it did pretty well. It did not out perform other m2 drives but it does the job. It is definitely something I can use on my mini itx build. Overall I think this is an okay M2 solid state drive but it is really not worth the price. The performance difference between this and other M2 drives is not enough to warrant the price difference. It does have a smaller memory so it may really only hold the OS and some programs.', ""Die schnelle NVME SSD passt in den vorhanden M2 Slot meines Mainboards ohne Probleme. Hier liegt sie in der Standard-Größe vor, in dem auch schon meine anderen M2-SSD's vorlagen. Eine Schraube und ein Abstandshalter werden ebenfalls mitgeliefert, so dass man hier auf der sicheren Seite ist, falls das Mainboard nicht alle benötigten Utensilien bereithält. Der Vorteil von NVME SSD's ist, dass sie deutlich schneller als Standard SATA SSD's sind.Installation:Wie beschrieben benötigt man einen freien M2-Slot auf dem Mainboard. Dieser kann sich auch unter einem Kühlkörper verstecken. Die SSD wird in einem leichten Winkel reingeschoben, nach unten gedrückt und per Schraube festgeschraubt. Der M2-Slot befindet sich oft zwischen Grafikkarte und Prozessor.Geschwindigkeit:Ich habe zum testen einmal eine frische Windows 11 Installation auf der SSD von einem USB 3.0 Stick durchgeführt. Bereits nach 3 Minuten konnte ich aktiv meine Daten eingeben und nach ca. 10 Minuten war das System fertig eingerichtet. Wirklich schnell.Ich habe danach Lese- und Schreibtests durchgeführt und bin zu folgenden Ergebnissen gekommen:Lesen: 2700 MB/sSchreiben: 650 MB/sDies ist ein bisschen langsamer als SSD's im gleichen Preisbereich. Allerdings wird man die Geschwindigkeitsunterschiede nicht mehr merken. Alles über 500 MB/s sollte so schnell sein, dass der normale Anwender keinen Unterschied merken sollte. Zudem sollten SSD's mit größerer Kapazität baubedingt auch noch ein wenig schneller sein. Die Variante mit 512 GB hat sicherlich mehrere Chips, auf die parallel geschrieben werden können.Größe:Ich konnte die 128 GB Version testen. Diese reicht meiner Meinung nach für eine Systemfestplatte aus, wenn man nur Windows, Treiber und die nötigsten Programme, wie den Browser installiert. Danach sind immer noch über 60 GB frei. Wer allerdings auch Spiele oder mehrere Anwendungen auf der Festplatte installieren möchte, sollte meiner Meinung nach eher zu dem Modell mit 512 GB greifen, da der Preisunterschied nicht so groß ist.Fazit:Eine schnelle NVME Festplatte, die noch einmal deutlich schneller ist als herkömmliche SATA SSD's. Der Einbau, die Erkennung vom Computer und die Verwendung der SSD sind sehr einfach und haben problemlos auf Anhieb funktioniert. Zum Zeitpunkt des Tests war die Festplatte verglichen mit anderen Modellen relativ teuer. Aber vielleicht kann man ja ein gutes Schnäppchen machen, wenn sich der Preis ändert oder wenn es ein gutes Angebot gibt."", ""Short version:Do not buy this SSD, at least not on Amazon. At $40 it's terrible for what it is, even for a 128GB. However you can get it on Aliexpress for <$19, sometimes <$18 (which is not bad for a 128GB NVMe dramless SSD)Also it's dramless (not an issue), and uses the SM2263XT controller (more of an issue because some of the pictures show it using an Innogrit Shasta+ instead, and that's a much better controller).At 1800mbps sequential read and 550mbps sequential write is not a big issue (it is only a 128GB SSD, lower-capacity SSDs tend to have worse performance than the same SSD w/ a larger capacity), at least it's on paper better than SATASlightly longer version:This was tested on a Asus Q87m-A w/ a i7 4770 on a pcie adapter (so it's definitely getting all the possible bandwidth even though I'm not using it as a boot device). It's about what one would expect for a dramless NVMe SSD (the low write speeds make sense given its smaller capacity), although I'm pretty certain the ADATA SX6000lite at the same capacity still has better performance.Mine came with a Silicon Motion 2263XT controller. This is the same on the Aliexpress listing, but the Amazon listing shows it using an Innogrit Shasta+ controller, which is a much more performant controller so it's kind of misleading in terms of what this is. I'm not worried about the significantly lower sequential read/write numbers, because it is only a 128GB SSD, and because of the lowered capacity typically 128GB SSDs have the worst performance in the same kind of SSD. 1800mbps sequential read and 550mbps sequential write means it's still technically better than SATA, especially in terms of read.2 Micron MT29F512G08EEHAFJ4-3R NAND chips make up the storage part of this SSD. At least it's TLC and not QLC, so Dynon Metrics didn't cheap out on that part.Bottom line though, don't buy this on Amazon. It's less than half the price on Aliexpress for the same thing, and even if you are looking for a lower-capacity NVMe SSD, you probably don't have a good warranty nor firmware updates in the future. I feel bad giving this thing a 3-star given that it hasn't done anything bad, but showing this with an Innogrit controller (which is better than the SM2263XT that's in the SSD) is faulty advertising, and the price is even more misleading."", 'Dynon Metrics PCIe NVMe M.2 interne SSD-Festplatte.Ich habe sie in ein kleines Gehäuse gemacht und so eine externe Festplatte daraus gemacht.Funktioniert gut, die lese und Schreibgeschwindigkeit kann ich aber nicht glauben, ich weiß nicht ob das was macht weil sie in einem externen Gehäuse für ssd ist oder ob es an der Festplatte liegt, aber die angegebenen Werte erreicht sie keinesfalls.Dennoch ist sie schnell genug für mich und meine Zwecke, Bilder und Videos zu speichern usw.Deswegen 4 Sterne.', 'Die M.2 SSD von Dynon Metrics überzeugt durch ihre Funktionalität.Sie ist - wie alle anderen M.2 SSDs - schnell eingebaut und wurdevon meinem System auch schnell und problemlos erkannt.Mit einer Lesegeschwindigkeit von bis zu 2200 MB/s und einerSchreibgeschwindigkeit von bis zu 1700 MB/s ist sie unter den M.2 SSDskeine Besonderheit, daher muss ich auch sagen, dass der Preis füreine NoName SSD (zum Testzeitpunkt über 40€) überzogen ist.Als Vergleich: Crucial P2 CT250P2SSD8 mit 250GB bietet nicht nurvergleichbare Geschwindigkeiten, sondern auch das doppelte anSpeicherplatz zu einem niedrigeren Preis. Darüber hinaus ist Crucial dannauch noch ein bekannter Markenhersteller, auf den viele schwören(ich selbst habe seit Jahren neben einer Samsung auch eine Crucial inmeinem System laufen, weil einfach die Preis-Leistung hier der Wahnsinnist).Die Dynon Metrics wäre nicht meiner erste Wahl. Nicht nur weil ich mitdem NoName Hersteller wenig Erfahrungen habe, sondern hauptsächlich,weil er für mehr Geld weniger bietet als die etablierte und bekannte Konkurrenz.Von mir gibt es für die schlechte Preis-Leistung (trotz guter Funktionalität)3 Sterne und somit keine Kaufempfehlung.', 'Dynon Metrics PCIe NVMe M.2 128 GB SSDDieser Dynon Metrics PCIe NVMe M.2 128 GB NVME würde mir als Amazon Vine Mitglied zur Verfügung gestellt, ich werde hier meine persönliche Objektive Meinung und Erfahrung mitteilen.Der NVME SSD wird in eine Kunststoff Schutz Verpackung im Karton ausreichend geschützt geliefert, zusätzlich dazu ist ein Befestigung Schraube und Halterung, das ist im Vergleich mit anderem Hersteller schon sehr gutIch habe dieser SSD auf einen PCI-e X16 SSD NVME Adapterkarte gesteckt und ohne Probleme würde der Erkannt (Datenträgerverwaltung öffnen) anschließend habe ich einige Test gemacht, sowie Windows 10 installiert, dies ging alles zügig und Problemlos.Der SSD ist sowohl bei PCI-e 4 x Lane als 8 x Lane sehr schnell, sogar etwas über die angegebene Werte. (die Werte sind fast identisch mit meinen Intel PCCI-e NVME SSD 400 GB) Siehe auch beide Screenshots.Was aber fehlt seitens der Hersteller ist die entsprechende Software bzw. der Hinweis welche Kompatible ist, um der SSD zu Optimieren und vorallemden 100% zu Löschen.(Bei andere Hersteller gibt es sehr gute Software dazu)Fazit : Preis etwas hoch aber ist schnell', 'Im Rahmen des Amazon-Vine Programms wurde mir die SSD von Dynon Metrics zur Verfügung gestellt.Es handelt sich um die Variante mit 128GB und einem Anschluss nach NVMe 1.3-Standard (PCIe NVMe M.2).Ich teste die SSD in einem externen Gehäuse mit USB-C Anschluss.Daher kann ich die laut Beschreibung hohe Lese- und Schreibgeschwindigkeit nicht bestätigen.Im Verhältnis zu meiner vorher verbauten SSD ist diese schon eher „langsam“. Die Schreibgeschwindigkeit liegt 15-20MB/s niedriger.Erkannt wurde die SSD unter Windows 10 sofort. Hier gibt es nichts zu bemängeln.Eine Aussage über die Lebensdauer kann ich hier nichts sagen, obwohl dies neben der Geschwindigkeit eines der wichtigsten Punkte ist.Bis zum Test war mir der Hersteller Dynon Metrics völlig unbekannt. Daher kann ich auch nicht auf andere Produkte des Herstellers referenzieren.Anmerken möchte ich allerdings, dass der Preis von fast 43 EUR für die 128GB-Variante absolut überteuert ist und somit neben der Schreibgeschwindigkeit zu einer Abwertung auf 3/5 Sterne führt.Ich hoffe, meine Rezension war euch „hilfreich“. Danke.', 'Ok performance but a good drive for my pi']"

First thing I will say about this is that is a very simple solid state drive. I will also say that this really works pretty well as a boot drive.

The PCI bracket is not vented.  U.2 drives run hot and every bit of case ventilation helps.2. The mounting solution for the drives is not the best.  The card uses oblong slots and the drive mounting screws have tiny little heads that don't really get a good bite on the mounting slot b/c the head is almost the same width as the slot.  Other manufacturer's cards have either correctly sized mounting holes or use threaded inserts.  I needed a card that would ship to me overnight, and this was the only one that would arrive overnight.  For my use, the card is in a racked server that will never get bumped around, so I'm assuming it would be fine.  If you're using this card in a normal PC case that might get bumped around, I'd be a little nervous about the screws pulling through the slots.""]"

The advertised read/write speeds are completely average. I didn't do precise measurements but performance is about as expected. Any SSD will give you a lot of advantage over an HDD, of course.Now, the one thing is that this is very lightweight (good) at the expense of durability. The case is cheap plastic, not metal or even durable plastic. So I'd be reasonably careful. Of course, you're going to put this in your desktop computer so it won't get banged around, which is why I don't view this as a huge negative.I give this four stars as I think that's a fair rating.

Partly for speed and lack of moving parts, and partly because I wanted to go to 4TB and that wasn't an option with a regular HDD. But a 4TB drive that's rated for the kind of use I'm expecting to give it runs to some $500, so I decided to test the waters first. Enter the mSATA drive.Yes, I know mSATA is smaller and slower but figured it would not only be faster than my existing HDD but also potentially work as a boot drive so I could have my entire SSD as a data drive, or as a backup volume for things small enough to be copied locally. In any event it's cheap enough that if I didn't like the speed boost I got I'd know to explore a new computer rather than dropping more $$$ on improving the one I have.Having never seen an mSATA drive before it was remarkably small. Installing it was trivially easy - I first installed it into a USB enclosure and cloned my boot volume onto it, then fitted it into my laptop. It took longer to get the back off my laptop than it did to fit the drive - it's literally a case of plugging it in, pushing it into place and securing it with a screw.It works a lot faster than my old HDD, which is nice. It gives me a larger boot volume than I had before, which is also nice (you can get this thing in a range of sizes, I went for 512GB and configured it as a 256GB boot volume, a 200GB encrypted data partition, and the rest as swap space.The only real downside of it is that it seems to get quite hot. The Kingston software that manages their SSDs reports it running at about 25C as soon as it's fired up and it warms to around 50C (122F) after a fairly short time even when it's not used hard. When I generated a 200GB encrypted volume on it and copied some files into the encrypted volume the software reported it reached 68C. My laptop has pretty good fans in it, and this feels like the sort of temperature that's not necessarily a good thing. So far it hasn't affected the performance but I've only run it for about 25 hours in total so far.From the top of the laptop there's no obvious evidence of anything spectactularly warm, and I haven't gone as far as running it with the back off and checking the temperature with a thermal camera, so it may be the software is reporting a temperature higher than the reality. I mention it because if you're running something that's already pushing heat limits you may want to know. It seems like the kind of situation where a fan would help, but adding a fan would mean it wouldn't fit into a regular mSATA slot any more.So overall I'd like to give it five stars but hold back a little because the temperature is mildly concerning."", 'PRO 👍✔️ Upgrade perfetto per DELL Latitude E7240 (per altri computer, consultare il supporto tecnico del produttore prima dell\'acquisto)✔️ ➡️ Installazione facilissima su DELL Latitude E7240 ⬅️: si rimuove la batteria, 2 viti, e si fa scorrere il coperchio del retro del portatile per accedere alla scheda madre.

Plugged it all back in, PS5 immediately on boot detected it and asked me if I wanted to format it warning all contents would be lost with option to cancel. Formatting took about 5 seconds. And a read test said it was able to get something like 6500MB/s out of it. Whilst not the full 7000MB/s I read that's because it's only 1TB and you need a 2TB one to get closer to the max speeds.I tested it out by moving Ratchet and clank rift apart from internal storage to expansion storage and it took about 20 seconds, so pretty fast considering it's shifting 39.3GB!All in all I'm happy really happy with the speed, the heat sink and the price! I expect once the update is finally released there will be a bit of mad rush for m2 drives such as this so if you can get it close to £171 like I did go for it now.

acquistato questo SSD Samsung per fare un upgrade sul mio Mac del 2015, ormai ultra piantato!!Il lavoro è stato importante e ha previsto la sostituzione del vecchio hard disk SSD (Blade) nvme M.2 Pci 3.0 x4 (2280) da 24 GB con un SSD Nvme da 2TB e il disco SATA III con questo SSD Samsung.Usando un apposito adattatore (poiché la forma degli Nvme Apple è unica e non si adatta ai normale nvme in commercio) ( https://www.amazon.it/dp/B08JTDLMXJ )Se avete intenzione di metter mano al vostro Mac verificate prima la serie e la compatibilità dei componenti. questi indicati sono specifici per i Mac del 2015-2017 dal 2017 in poi si possono usare dischi nvme più performanti (su google trovate ulteriori info googlando sostituzione blade mac e consigli sui componenti migliori da scegliere per il vostro Mac da upgradare che troverete poi qui su Amazon ai migliori prezzi)oltre i componenti sopra indicati necessitate di 2 serie di componenti di smontaggio e rimontaggio e una serie di adesivi per il display.Su YouTube trovate tutti i video che vi guidano passo passo all'esecuzione dell'operazione, si raccomanda una adeguata manualità e capacità di mettere mano a componenti elettronici (io sono un tecnico e quindi di queste cose mi occupo nella quotidianità) altrimenti meglio cercare un bravo tecnico che si occupi lui di rianimare il vs Mac.Posso confermare che dopo questa operazione il mio Mac ha ripreso vita, e probabilmente è più veloce di come fosse in origine con la sua piccola memoria M2 da 24 GB e il disco meccanico da 1 TB. adesso ha 2 TB di disco che gestisce sistema operativo e applicazioni e altri 2 TB dove ho messo Windows 10 e anche lui è una scheggia.Considerando che faccio editing anche di file multimediali, la velocità di elaborazione è importante e ora è davvero roba di attimi per ogni operazione anche in multitasking, eseguendo più procedure senza particolari problemi.Il benchmark dei dischi ha dato risultati come previsto, Samsung SSD 560 MB/s in lettura e 520 MB/s in scrittura.Su questo SSD ho installato Windows 10 e il software Magician.Il prodotto è ottimo e assolutamente consigliato.il disco PCI 3,0 con la mia configurazione è arrivato a 3.000 MB/s con connessione PCI 3.0 negoziata a 8 GT/s(prima del lavoro negoziava 5 GT/s con il disco da 24 GB apple)Sono rimasto davvero soddisfatto di ogni componente utilizzato e con una spesa di neanche 250 euro ho ridato vita a un Mac che altrimenti era praticamente inutilizzabile (sul Mac del 2015 viaggia Monterey OS, la penultima versione supportata per questo Mac)Se avete bisogno di altre info, fate una domanda e vi risponderò volentieriHo scelto i prodotti più performanti/compatibili per il mio Mac e maggiore vita utile come TBW utili.Spero la mia esperienza possa essere stata utile, e resto a disposizione per chi avesse bisogno di altre info"", 'NON ci sono tantissime recensioni sul modello da 2Tb,certo il prezzo alto frena un pòl\'utenza ed è più facile convergere sul modello da 1Tb o 512Mb,tuttavia,considerandoche le differenze sono veramente minime tra i vari tagli,in sintesi non c\'è moltoaltro da dire che non sia già stato detto da altri recensori su questo ssd 870Evo di Samsung®;Sperando di fare cosa gradita,imposterò questa mia recensione come se parlassi ad unneofita del mondo informatico,mi limiterò a dare qualche numero tecnico rilevato infase di test subito dopo l\'installazione,qualche consiglio che darei anche aqualche amico poco esperto in materia,e qualche suggerimento per poterloutilizzare al meglio.Come si presenta:E\' bene chiarire subito che questo ssd arriva in uno scatolino di cartone con i solitiloghi del produttore,nome del modello e numero seriale,utile in caso di qualcheproblema;Lo scatolino di cartone deve presentare 2 adesivi di colore nero,uno posto nella partesuperiore e uno sottostante recante il nome del prodotto e del seriale,che fungono dasigilli,in sintesi dovete essere voi a tagliarli con un coltellino/taglierino,secosì non fosse,il prodotto è già stato aperto.All\'interno troverete un manuale compatto,anch\'esso con un sigillo nero da tagliare,sotto di esso vi sarà una vaschetta di plastica sagomata che ospiterà il compattoe leggerissimo 870 Evo.Niente altro vi è dovuto,non troverete cavi sata e/o di alimentazione,nessuna vite,sono tutte cose che dovrete procurarvi voi,sembra sciocco e scontato ma per moltinon è così.A questo punto gli scenari di utilizzo sono due:1)montarlo in sostituzione del vecchio hard-disk principale(dove risiede il vostrosistema operativo)oppure...2)utilizzarlo come hard disk aggiuntivo,per operazioni di stoccaggio e/o installazionedi programmi e/o giochi.Nel primo caso avrete 2 scelte da fare:A)installazione pulita di tutto il sistema operativo,con relativa installazione di driver,software etc.etc... è vero,si perde più tempo...lo sò,tuttavia,è sempre la strategiamigliore da adottare per un sistema fresco,pulito e veloce.Nel caso in cui non potete perdere tempo e il vostro sistema operativo è perfettamenteconfigurato per il vostro lavoro:B)Avvalervi del software che Samsung vi mette a disposizione ""gratis"" sul suo sito perpoter MIGRARE i dati (compreso il vostro sistema operativo) da un vecchio HD anche nondi marca Samsung,al vostro nuovo 870 Evo,il software si chiama ""samsung data migration""facilmente individuabile attraverso il vostro motore di ricerca preferito.Premesso che qualsiasi sia la vostra scelta,l\'ssd va\' montato a pc spento:per un installazione pulita dovrete scaricarvi,tramite il tool di microsoft,la ISO di windows(10 o 11) dal sito ufficiale e successivamente scegliere se installarla su un dvd o su unapendrive vuota,quest\'ultima dovrà essere priva di altri file e verrà resa avviabile dalsoftware di windows(lo stesso che vi permetterà di scaricare la ISO),finita laprocedura di ""masterizzazione"" (dvd/pendrive) dovrete riavviare il pc escegliere dal bios il boot da DVD o PenDrive per l\'installazione pulita,su come impostare il boot fate riferimento al manuale della vostrascheda madre.Per utilizzarlo come ssd aggiuntivo basta spegnere il pc,collegare l\'alimentazione e il cavosata al 970 Evo ed accendere il pc,windows NON lo rileverà alla prima accenzione,quindidovremo inizializzarlo attraverso ""gestione disco"" richiamabile attraverso la barra diricerca in basso a sinistra,una volta lanciato ""gestione disco"",vi apparirà unafinestra che vi avvisa che l\'ssd per essere utilizzato andrà ""inizializzato"",basterà cliccare su avanti un ""tot"" di volte fino alla conclusione diquesto passaggio necessario.Ho sintetizzato all\'osso ma il concetto è giusto,per approfondire Google vi è amico.Ora parliamo un pò di prestazioni:Il prodotto è palesemente conforme con i dati che dichiara Samsung sul suo sito;Senza girarci intorno:💥 E\' MOLTO VELOCE 💥Nelle foto allegate lascio uno screenshot del benchmark ""CrystalDiskMark"" che chiariscein modo cristallino quanto asserito.I valori dichiarati da Samsung sono:""Velocità di lettura sequenziale fino a 560 MB/s e velocità di scrittura sequenziale fino a 530 MB/s""Quindi perchè il mio benchmark e quello di molti altri sono così diversi tra loro se pur molto elevati?Basta prestare attenzione alla parola ""fino a"",in sintesi quel ""fino a"" sta ad indicare:""in condizioni ideali"" in parole comprensibili si intende un ambiente ideale,dove il chipset dellascheda madre sia sufficientemente in grado di gestire tutta la banda passante sulla porta Sata 6,al netto che non siano presenti più di due unità;Nel mio caso,anche se è un pò estremo,sulla mia scheda madre ho ben 4 ssd + 2 hard disk meccanici,che occupano tutte le mie sei porte sata6,più due SSD Nvme M.2 entrambi pci-express 4.0,quindi ilchipset (X570-AMD) della mia scheda madre è a pieno carico nel gestire tutte le linee,pertantoè fisiologico un piccolo degrado della banda passante e conseguentemente non raggiungo a pienole velocità dichiarate.Perchè questo approfondimento sulle prestazioni?Perchè il prodotto perfetto non esiste,ci sarà sempre una recensione di qualche utente che nonpercepisce o non riesce a raggiungere il ""fino a"",o in alcuni casi magari dovuto all\'hardwaredatato sarà proprio impossibile anche raggiungere più della metà delle prestazioni dichiarate,quindi prima di gridare al ""complotto"" è sempre cosa buona e giusta,verificare che il nostrosistema sia in grado di raggiungere o avvicinarsi ai valori di cui sopra,testare in modocontinuativo,nei primi 30 giorni di vita,che il prodotto sia esente da difetti,in casocontrario,reso o sostituzione grazie all\'ottima assistenza Amazon.P.S.Samsung su questo modello offre una garanzia di ben 5 anni.Un ultimo accorgimento,la deframmentazione e gli ssd non vanno molto d\'accordo,sedeframmentate un ssd (di qualsiasi tipo) ne accorcerete la vita di molto oltrea non apportare nessun tipo di beneficio tangibile nell\'uso di tutti i giorni.non voglio tediarvi con spiegazioni tecniche,ma se volete approfondire la questioneil web è pieno di guide e suggerimenti.In conclusione mi ritengo molto soddisfatto dell\'acquisto,lo consiglierei in qualsiasitaglio di memoria senza riserve,il software di gestione ""Samsung magician"" è un ottimotool per verificare l\'integrità dell\'unità,eseguire benchmark e per gli aggiornamentidel firmware oltre a mostrare la temperatura di esercizio.Per le mie esigenze è un articolo che merita le ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ stelle.La mia scala di voto è così definita:⭐️ stella prodotto da evitare⭐️⭐️ stelle prodotto insufficiente,⭐️⭐️⭐️ stelle prodotto sufficiente,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ stelle prodotto buono,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ stelle prodotto ottimo.Come mia abitudine se dovessi rilevare anomalie o difettinel breve o lungo periodo sarà mia cura portarveli aconoscenza,modificare questa recensione e relativovoto finale.Spero che questa mia recensione sia stata interessante. 👋', ""Let's get the obvious out of the way, It's a Sata drive, So up to 560mbs Read and 530mbs Write,If you want it ro be fastest you could buy two and used it as a software Raid, Then you get double the speed,But why when you could just buy a 4tb PCIE3.0 m.2 that's 6x the speed for the same price for a different manufacturer?Because simply old laptops/ Pc's and last generation consoles don't have an M.2 slot so you can't use them and sata is the only option,On the drive itself the 4tb 870 evo is excellent for a sata drive, It has dram inside 4gb infact, That's like 2008 levels of ram in a top end pc of that time,Why 4* rather than 5* you might ask?,Actually plugging the drive in my pc only to run disk manager to format it and well... it could only format it to 2tb rather that 4tb but the remaining 2tb that was an not yet allocated couldn't be merged into the volume,The only solution I had was to remove the 870 evo plug in my sata to usb 3.1 cable I've had laying about for the past year and formatting as an external drive,That worked then once that was done I then put it back in my pc to format once again,I know I said at the start of this review that it's just a sata drive,But for most people that's all you would ever need,I have a 4tb firecuda 530 PCIE4.0 as my boot drive and this 4tb 870 evo is no where near the speed of that, But in games it's identical for load times,With certain games that are out in 2023 with  the Direct storage api and now with NVIDIA RTX IO that will be out with rachet & clank rift apart on pc very soon ssd storage will be used to it's full potential, Much like the near instant load times on the Playstation 5,With direct storage and rtx io what's the difference between 1 second with a PCIE4.0 ssd compared to 1.4 seconds to a sata ssd for game load times?,You can't even blink your eyes at 0.3 seconds,Anyway for a summary,Positive+ 5 years of warranty+ It doesn't use QLC memory cells unlike the 870qvo+78 GB cache size so you get full transfer speeds ( Most 4k video files are less than that)Negative= it's a sata drive so if you do alot of 4k video editing at 60fps or 120fps then a PCIE4.0 would be better as the faster the drive you have the better really,- My only personal issue of a brand new 4tb 870 evo not being able to format to the full capacity of the drive unless I used a cable to use it as an external drive to format it, If I didn't already have that cable in my draw it would of been a problem,Final summary,I personal use this 4tb 870 evo as a steam game storage and pc games pass storage,Why? Because some mad drivers in my area who like to crash into virgin media fiber cabinets and I'm left with no Internet for 10+ days and I don't want to use my precious mobile data for game downloads because mobile data companies hate it when you use youe phone as a hotspot because apparently 600gb of 4/5g data is now somehow unlimited, And well we all know games are big now like 100gb + some are even 200gb,If you can pick up a 4tb ssd for a decent price it's worth it,I wouldn't worry at all about games that use direct storage in the future because the difference between PCIE4 or 5 or even Sata ssd will be less that a 2 seconds because the graphics card in your PC will be doing the decompression of the data,"", ""I have a laptop which i gradually didn't use much because it was so slow when trying to open software programmes it was being timed out where it took so long. How many people have either disposed of their sluggish computers or even purchased a new one because new computers are faster but in time they will gradually slow down. Rather than wasting money on new computers and that look into a new solid state hard drive which i have done which is a fraction of the price of a new computer. You need to download some sort of software and buy a specific lead because using the software you will need to clone your hard drive in the computer to the new solid state drive. There is plenty of YouTube videos of how to do this for a particular make of computer and that but once fitting of the solid state hard drive you wont believe how quick it is. Everything now is so much quicker and really worth doing rather than wasting money on a new computer and then you got the worry then of is there any personal information on the computer if your were to get rid of it where a new solid state hard drive you won't have this worry. Depending how much data is on the computer to start with may determine how long the cloning will take but worth doing and save a lot money too compared to buying new computer or laptop."", 'Die Samsung 870 EVO SATA III 2.5 Zoll SSD (Modell MZ-77E500B/EU) mit 500 GB Speicher hat meine Erwartungen übertroffen. Die Installation war einfach, da sie problemlos in meinen vorhandenen Laptop passte.Was mich am meisten beeindruckt hat, ist die Geschwindigkeit dieser SSD. Mit Lesegeschwindigkeiten von 560 MB/s und Schreibgeschwindigkeiten von 530 MB/s ist sie spürbar schneller als die herkömmliche HDD, die ich zuvor verwendet hatte. Das hat die Boot-Zeit meines Computers erheblich verkürzt, und Programme starten jetzt praktisch sofort.Die Zuverlässigkeit von Samsung ist bekannt, und die 870 EVO macht hier keine Ausnahme. Sie hat sich bisher als äußerst stabil erwiesen und zeigt keine Anzeichen von Leistungsabfall.Insgesamt bin ich mit der Samsung 870 EVO SSD äußerst zufrieden. Sie hat meinen Computer spürbar beschleunigt und bietet ein hervorragendes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis. Eine klare Empfehlung für alle, die ihre Computerleistung steigern möchten!', ""I have never realised  that the speed of your HDD and its performance will degrease year after year . I was about to replace my super slow laptop then I thought about replacing the HHD with a much more performant SSD. WOW, you can even compare those two LOL. They are on different planets . My laptop now starts in seconds, before it would have been ready before 7/8 minutes from sleep mode. Every single task now is extremely quick , it seems like you are using your smartphone. I went through a lot of professional reviews on here before purchasing it and I would like to thanks all of the authors. I don't use this laptop for any specific graphic work or video editing  but the Samsung SSD  seems to be that special one  that I wanted to make sure that I would have not regretted my choice after installing it. Absolutely happy with my purchase. To clone your HHD  before installing the SSD , Samsung magician will help you but don't forget that you might need to buy a cable to connect the SSD. I bought  a StarTech.com SATA to USB Cable - USB 3.0 to 2.5”"", 'J’ai acheté ce disque dur SSD Samsung EVO 870 1To après que mon Samsung EVO PRO 850 512Go de 2016 ait rendu l’âme.Avec plusieurs images du système en backup, je voulais repartir sur un disque dur SSD de même capacité. Mais j’ai été confronté à un problème de taille (c’est le cas de le dire !) : car chaque disque dur a un espace disponible variable, et le backup de mon ancien SSD 512Go ne tenait pas dans mon nouveau disque, qui était pourtant lui aussi un 512Go.J’ai donc opté pour un SSD de capacité supérieure, et je ne regrette pas ce choix. Pour la restauration de l’image système, j’ai utilisé Veritas System Recovery (anciennement Norton Ghost). J’ai bien récupéré ma sauvegarde du 512Go mais, second problème, je me suis retrouvé avec une partition affichant 512Go alors que ce Samsung EVO 870 a une capacité de 1To !A l’aide d’un outil de partionnement, j’ai pu visualiser et déplacer l’espace libre masqué pour qu’il soit contigu à ma partition système. Au final, tout est ok et je dispose maintenant de plus d’espace libre. Cela améliore les performances de mon PC, notamment quand je fais de la retouche photo (sous Photoshop) ou du montage vidéo (sous Premiere Pro).Je suis satisfait des performances de ce disque, l’OS démarre rapidement et ce Samsung EVO 870 supporte évidemment mieux les chocs qu’un disque optique traditionnel. Il m’a coûté 86 euros et je trouve le rapport qualité/prix correct. Néanmoins, les SSD ne sont pas éternels, j’en ai fait la malheureuse expérience à plusieurs reprises et ne saurais que trop vous conseiller de faire des backups réguliers de vos données.Points positifs :+ Bonnes performances+ Supporte les chocs+ Disque compact+ Prix correctPoints négatifs :- Fiabilité relative', 'Ottimo ssd per chi vuole dare nuova vita al suo vecchio laptop.

Sé que hay otros programas que ofrecen esa opción, pero en el caso del programa de Samsung, ha sido coser y cantar, programa intuitivo, fácil de manejar y sin equivocaciones. Por cierto, permite clonar cualquier disco a tu nuevo samsung, pero el disco de destino tiene que ser marca samsung sí o sí.Ese aspecto hace que mi próximo disco duro también sea marca samsung. Estoy encantadísimo con el disco y con este programa.', 'After some deliberation between going for a new hard drive and a solid state drive, we pumped for an SSD. This Samsung SSD, offers good value (there are cheaper names that I’ve never heard of and definitely more expensive ones as well). Spent quite a long time comparing the speeds and things like that. Ultimately, the difference appear to be negligible certainly for the reasonably casual gaming usage that we are doing. definitely felt comfort in going for a known name (as someone fairly new to self build PCs).The drive was easy to install after watching a couple of quick YouTube videos, but I would be aware that you may need a longer connecting cable depending on the positioning of your components inside your tower.

Description is correct.The price with 117EUR is good, but not a best price - which was weeks ago for new 1TB at about 110EUR.The card is quickly plugged into one of the two PCIe x16 slots and was unused according to S.M.A.R.T. data.Could not get the card to boot with MBR partitioning.

I have noticed a perceivable difference when loading into games.  It seems to run hot in my system, although that may be my fault since I have installed it in pci slot 3, between two 2080 Ti in SLI.  I have a Noctua industrial 140mm fan ducted straight to the pci expansion, but this add in card cools down much slower than my graphics cards.  It is normal for it to reach temps of 75° C while gaming or running benchmarks. The graphics cards cool relatively quickly while this add in card comes back to stasis ~ 68° C in about 10 mins.  This places it outside its recommended operating temp, which strikes me as odd with so much airflow. My graphics cards will report temps below 50° within 1.5 minutes of max temps of 75°. I am still within my return period, so I'm not sure how I feel about checking out the internals of this drive to make sure the casing is in contact with the thermal transfer pads.  It is as fast as they advertise."", 'Ich hatte mir die AN1500 in der 2TB-Version zugelegt.  (Kaufdatum 22.04.21, EUR 465,99)Die vom Hersteller angegebene Lese-Geschwindigkeit von bis zu 6500Mb/sek konnte ich tatsächlich fast erreichen. (getestet m. CrystalDiskMark)Leider war ich etwas vorschnell und hatte erst beim Einbau festgestellt, dass aufgrund der erforderlichen 8-Lane-Anbindung nur sehr wenig Luft (im Wahrsten Sinne) zwischen die Grafikkarte und AN1500 gelangen konnte. Folglich wurde die Grafikkarte in Betrieb zu warm, bzw regelte entsprechend die Leistung runter. Die Lüfter der Grafikkarte drehten natürlich so hoch sie konnten, was für die entsprechende Geräuschkulisse sorgte.Also habe ich mal ausprobiert, was die AN1500 auf einem 4x Lane PCIE-Slot (eine Etage tiefer) noch so leistet. Entsprechend meiner Erwartungen, lagen Lese- und Schreibgeschwindigkeit im Bereich einer guten Gen3 Ssd.Ich hatte überlegt die SSD einfach mit einem Riser-Cable vertikal vor die Scheibe meines PC-Gehäuses zu montieren und so doch an dem 8x-Lane Slot zu betreiben.Leider ist mein Gehäuse nicht für eine Vertikalmontierung ausgelegt, sodass ich letztlich davon abgesehen habe.Zwischenzeitlich musste ich auch ergänzend feststellen, dass die AN1500 selbst im idle satte 50-52°C erreicht.  (zum Vergleich: meine 970 Evo lag selbst unter last im Bereich der 35Grad) Unter Last hat die AN1500, bei ""normalen"" Drehzahlen der Gehäuselüfter, mMn relativ ungesunde Temperaturen zwischen 65-68°C erreicht. Nur als die Lüfter bei 100% liefen, konnte die AN1500 bei ca. 58 Grad gehalten werden. (Stresstest). Zu diesem Zeitpunkt lief die AN1500 im 4x-Lane-Slot, also nicht direkt unterhalb der Grafikkarte.Die zu erwartende Haltbarkeit ( in TBW) ist aufgrund der beiden verbauten SN730 (400TBW) bei mMn ""nur"" ca 800 TB einzuordnen. Allerdings gibt es für die AN1500 seitens des Herstellers keine Garantieeinschränkungen in Sachen TBW. (anders als bei fast allen anderen, regulären SSDs) Die Rennerei im Garantiefall möchte ich mir aber sparen.Fazit:Ich habe mich dazu entschieden eine echte GEN4 (z.B Sabrent Rocket 4, Samsung 980Pro, oder Corsair MP600)  zu kaufen und die AN1500 zurückzuschicken.An sich eine gute SSD. Zu dem Preis aber für meinen Geschmack zu viele Abstriche.  Mit z.B einer Vertikalmontierung, könnte die AN1500 durchaus ihr Geld wert sein, wenn man keine M.2-Slots mehrPros:-Geschwindigkeiten auf GEN4 Niveau-Interessant für Nutzer denen es auf dem Mainboard an M.2-Slots mangelt-RGB-Beleuchtung für die, die darauf Wert legen-5 Jahre Garantie seitens Western Digital, unabhängig von der TBW.Cons:-wenig Platz zwischen Grafikkarte und AN1500, wenn letztere sachgemäß betrieben werden soll-auch ohne o.g. Umstand vergleichsweise heiß (unter Last UND im idle-Betrieb)-relativ niedrige Lebenserwartung in der Preiskategorie (voraussichtlich 800TB  bei der 2TB-Version)', ""I stuck one of these (I actually ordered two and an 8TB Drive for backup) in my ROG Crosshair VIII Formula board and in a fit of desire for more new toys ordered one the next day for my ROG Crosshair VIII Hero too as you can't buy just the one for children as it just upsets the other. In this case both were upset as it simply didn't work due to the on-going issues with the Asus BIOSs in their X570 boards. How do I know you ask? Well, I stuck it in my MSI Edge X570 and it worked fine but slower as I only have the X4 slot free. It did not work in the Asus's X4 slot incase you were wondering. If you are going to buy an x570 board then pay yer money and get the Godlike or the bang for the buck Tomahawk.

Für den Preis ist die Leistung und Geschwindigkeit jedoch absolut in Ordnung und es gibt nichts groß daran auszusetzen.Mit dem Windows Einrichtungstool konnte die SSD ohne Probleme eingerichtet und anschließend als Windows Systempartition verwendet werden.Alles in allem handelt es sich um eine gute SSD, die zuverlässig und schnell arbeitet zu einem guten Preis jedoch sind Konkurrenzprodukte anderer Hersteller mit gleicher Leistung deutlich günstiger zu bekommen, daher bekommt die SSD von mir zusammenfassend nur 4 von 5 Sterne.', 'Früher hatte ich viele Produkte von Emtec, bis das Unternehmen vor 20 Jahren Pleite ging und aufgelöst wurde.

Aber dies nur als kleine Anektode. Ich habe diese SSD in einen Intel NUC eingebaut, der als Mediaplayer genutzt wird auf Basis von libreelec. Dafür ist dieses Speichermedium gut geeignet. Sowohl die Lese- als auch die Schreibgeschwindigkeit waren jederzeit angemessen. Es gab bislang noch gar keine Probleme mit diesem Produkt. Zum Zeitpunkt der Rezension sind Konkurrenzprodukte anderer Hersteller allerdings deutlich günstiger zu bekommen, bei gleicher Leistung.', ""MAN SOLL SICH NICHT ZU FRÜH FREUEN: Heute habe ich die SSD in ein NVMe Case eingebaut,  … und dann geht die M.2 SSD von EMTEC nicht. Genau wie vor ein paar Wochen schon die 1 TB von VANSUNY … und ab da beginnt's dann zu rattern im Oberstübchen – kann das sein!?JA und warum – weil der Herr ein Hirsch ist – woher soll denn die arme Festplatte wissen , was sie ist, wenn sie frisch aus der Fabrik kommt und dann in ein NVMe-Case PCIe 3.0 x4 gesteckt wird. EBEN! Da gibt es zB unter Windows ein Dienstprogramm (rechte Maustaste auf die Win-Kachel in blau), das heißt DATENTRÄGERVERWALTUNG (oder auch DATENTRÄGERMANAGEMENT) . Das rufen Sie auf … und haben Sie jetzt Ihre neue EMTEC ins Case eingebaut und angesteckt, dann findet sich als Datenträger No 1 oder 2 oder in  meinem Fall 5 sich der 953,xx MB große M2.-Speicherstreifen.Windows bietet nun an, das neue Gerät als MBR oder GPT verwaltetes Speichermedium anzubinden und einzurichten. (Für MBR-Datenträger wird die standardmäßige BIOS-Partitionstabelle verwendet. GPT-Datenträger verwenden die Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). GPT-Datenträger haben u. a. den Vorteil, dass jeder Datenträger mehr als vier Partitionen enthalten kann. GPT ist außerdem für Datenträger mit mehr als zwei Terabyte (TB) erforderlich.)Klarer Fall – MBR war von 1985-2005 bzw. auch heute noch, GPT ist die aktuelle Art, wie Datenträger verwaltet und organisiert werden. ALSO WÄHLEN SIE GPT … und innerhalb einiger Sekunden frägt Sie Windows nach einem Datenträger-Buchstaben für das EINFACHE VOLUME, das Sie auf dem Streifen jetzt per weiterem Rechtsklick eingerichtet haben… zB E:\\ für EMTEC und dann geht's auch schon los.Der Crystaldiskmark zeigt an einer Thunderbolt 3 USB-A Schnittstelle in einem Case von FARBOKO Nvme Gehäuse, USB 3.2 Gen 2 Typ-A & Typ-C 2-Port M.2 SSD (ASIN B0BHYNVX65, 22€, nicht zu empfehlen, mager ausgestattet, aber man braucht kein Kabel mehr, das reissts wieder raus) folgende Werte: Schreiben: 992 MBsec, Lesen 1047 MBsec – intern verbaut wäre das vermutlich ums doppelte schneller, aber das ist für ein einfaches Case mit 10MBsec mit einem USB-A Stecker am einen Ende und einem USB-C-Stecker am anderen Ende schon ein zufriedenstellendes Ergebnis. Geärrgert hat mich, dass kein selbstklebendes  Wärmeleitpad beilag um den Preis.Am Ende ist bei meinem ersten Speicherstreifen von VANSUNY vor 8 Wochen mein Case von HATOKU durchgebrannt, die sehr gute wärmeleitenden Cases von GiGimundo und Sanzang haben den Speicherstreifen überlebt! Und auch mein wunderschöner Tower mit blauer Beleuchtung GRAUGEAR ASIN B0BGJKVSKT , für 39€ , ist Opfer des Streifens geworden. Warum ist eigentlich unklar. Weil schon damals habe ich den blutigen Anfängerfehler begangen, den Streifen in der Datenträgerverwaltung nicht anzumelden und zu formatieren. MEA CULPA. Das habe ich nun heute gleich nachgeholt und bin überrascht, dass der 1TB Streifen von VANSUNY tatsächlich eine gewaltige Leseleistung im Crystaldiskmark hat: 1045 MBsec Lesen und 992 MBsec schreiben – dafür bekommt der VANSUNY nun meine 3D Kameraaufnahmen von der INSTA 360 X2 PRO – unglaublich große Dateien bei 5.6K Videoauflösung. Dass der Wal jetzt hinter mir auftaucht, das ist heute kein Problem mehr für mich mit dieser Kamera – ich hab ihn drauf! Und zum Schnitt der Dateien einen schnellen angebundenen Speicher am Notebook – wunderbar.Nebenbei … kenne ich emtec als Marke von den alten Tonbändern schon gut über 5 Jahrzehnte, also haben die in meinen Augen ja schon einen Qualitätsanspruch zu erfüllen – nun – im externen Betrieb rangiert er im Mittelfeld✅  Mittelschnelle 2500/2000 MBsec NVMe PCIe 3x4 Speicherkarte mit 953 MB = 1TB⛔️  MEINE M.2 SSD war nicht  D E F E K T  --  Datenträgerverwaltung – Formatieren !!!!🥊  KO-Kriterium 🎯  Preis  ist attraktiv  - die Geschwindigkeit eher Mittelmaß extern📣 1047 MBsec lesen, 992 MBsec schreiben – EMTEC als GPT einfaches Volume T: unter Win 11💬  Datenträgerverwaltung & GPT als Zugriffsmethode & einfaches Volume & Laufwerksbuchstabe📦 Verpackung:  staubdicht – fassen Sie bitte NICHT die goldfarbenen Kontakte an – statische Aufladung🛠 Verarbeitung:  wie alle anderen auch⚙️ Technik:  PCIe 3.

Die 1TB sogar für 80€ - und die Crucial P3 ist noch günstigerDa sind die knapp 40€ für die 1TB VANSUNY mit 2100/1600 Mbsec oder eben die hier gerade 1TB emtec für 60€ mit 2500/2000 Mbsec zwar noch ganz gut im Kurs. Keine Frage – für ein Notebook würde ich immer nur die Crucial (oder eine Samsung) beispielsweise wählen, allerdings gibt es erhebliche Wärmeprobleme bei einem Ultrabook – ich hatte ein ASUS Zenbook UX330, das ich damit totgegrillt habe – Speicherkartenfehler – flackernder wabernder Bildschirm. Die SSD hat die Kiste zu sehr erwärmt – und ein paar Stunden TV schauen gab dem NB den Rest! Kostspieliges Experiment!Überraschenderweise war die Vansuny extern kaum schneller als erwartet und die EMTEC gar langsamer als erwartet und dabei noch ein paar Euro teurer. 39 zu 57€ sogar! 1:1 technisch!Bei meinem derzeitigen X14 OLED ASUS Ultrabook habe ich die 2TB Crucial nicht mehr direkt verbaut, sondern habe sie mit rund einem Drittel der Geschwindigkeit in einem externen Case jetzt genutzt. Das neue Asus hat aber auch eine Doppellüftungsanlage, vermutlich wäre es dieses Mal besser gegangen – aber da die ASUS NBs mit viel aufgelötetem Haupt-Speicher ja nicht gerade billig sind …Kostenlose Geschwindigkeitstest mit der Software CristalDiskMark.So ist das beim Aufrüsten immer ein Problem – nicht nur, ob es auch der richtige Slot ist – sehen Sie neben der eingesägten Zunge an der Speicherkarte sind noch 5 Kontakte – das muss Ihr Slot oder Ihr Case aufnehmen können. Es gibt Karten mit 4 und 6 Pins und auch welche mit zwei Zungen.So wird die VANSUNY wie auch die EMTEC auch nur in der Console oder im NB verbaut die Geschwindigkeiten bringen und auch nur, wenn ausreichend Kühlung zur Verfügung steht. Das war beim Filmrendern bei meiner 2TB gut zu sehen – Anfangs eine Geschwindigkeit von über 3000 MBsec, die manchmal schon nach wenigen Sekunden bis auf 300 MBsec heruntergebremst wurde, weil die Platine nicht ausreichend gekühlt wurde. Etwas Abhilfe brachte dann ein Hitzeableiter – nicht aus Kupfer, sondern gerippt aus Graphene – mir unverständlich, warum das Material so selten angeboten wird. Ich habs für ein paar Euro in China samt Wärmeleitpaste bestellt. Leitet ein Mehrfaches besser als Kupfer.DIE VANSUNY entwickelte normale Temperaturen, wurde auch erkannt, und hätte ich mich an die „Usancen“ der Inbetriebnahme eines Massenspeichers erinnert, dann hätte mir einfallen müssen, dass der neue Speicherstreifen unter WINDOWS erstmal mit der Datenträgerverwaltung zugeordnet (GPT) und „formatiert“ werden muss wie jede andere Festplatte auch . Warum ich 2 Cases ruiniert habe ist mir allerdings am Ende schleierhaft.Jedenfalls hats mich gefreut, dass ich eine SSD zum Test bekam und sie hätte auch im externen Case eine gute Figur machen können, weil eben die Signalverarbeitung über die USB 3.x Schnittstellen niemals die Geschwindigkeiten des PCIe-Slots direkt auf dem Board erreichen werden. Allerdings, wer Thunderbolt 3 oder gar 4 in seinem Gerät schon verbaut hat, wird staunen, was da doch noch mehr geht. 1000 MBsec sind schon noch drin – und das schlägt jede alte mechanische Platte!Jedenfalls für 39/57€ eine SSD und 15-22 für ein passendes Case bei externem Betrieb ist kein Geld mehr – nehmen Sie eine günstige Sandisk Ultra 1TB SSD-Speicherkarte (die Telefonkartengroßen Dinger), kostet die 60€ mit 535/350 MBsec und als schnelle V30 Version kostet Sie die kleine microSDXC Speicherkarte derzeit 100-130€, und Sie erreichen nicht die Geschwindigkeiten der M2.SSD.Die M.2 2280 Gen3x4 ist jedenfalls Preis-Leistung ihre 5 Sterne wert und sie hat angeblich den Vorteil wenig Strom zu verbrauchen, was insbesondere im mobilen Betrieb Bedeutung hat. Die EMTEC war der VANSUNY allerdings unterlegen – und die CRUCIAL P5 ist eh eine ganz andere technische Liga – ist aber auch ein Kühlproblem ggf.Irritiert hat mich gerade nur, dass auf der offiziellen VANSUNY Website keine NVMe SSD angeboten wird, sondern nur USB 3.1 Flash Drives und SD-Speicherkarten in kleineren Speicherdimensionen, so dass die hier vorgestellte PCIe Card ein neues Produkt in der Testphase sein kann, das deswegen auch einen attraktiven Einführungspreis bekommen hat und man die Bewertungen der Tester und Erstkäufer abwartet. Oder es ist gar keine VANSUNY – Hersteller sollte jedenfalls KOOTION Information Technology Co LTD in Tangxia Town, Dongguan City, Guangdong, CHINA seinUnd … ich geb mal 5 Sterne – würde aber eine 3500 MBsec Crucial P3 zum Angebotspreis von 46€ (Mai 23) mit 1TB Speicherplatz sofort den Vorzug geben. (ASIN B0B25LZGGW )Die mit 2500 MBsec ältere Crucial P2 ist sogar mit 1TB für 60€ sozusagen die teuerste heute. Der Markt bewegt sich unfassbar schnell.Schon doof, dass mir der Fehler mit dem Formatieren unterlaufen ist – blutiger Anfänger!🤙= 🙏"", 'Man erhält hier eine interne 3.0 – NVMe SSD in bestellter Ausführung von Emtec.Die SSD kam gut verpackt und in einwandfreiem Zustand bei mir an.Bestellt hatte ich die SSD in der Ausführung 1 TB und diese habe ich auch erhalten.Solch eine SSD eignet sich immer wunderbar als Systemfestplatte, damit alles schneller lädt und reibungsloser abläuft.Von der Leistung her finde ich diese hier, trotz des günstigen Preises, durchaus gut.Für Gamer würde ich sie aber nicht unbedingt empfehlen, da sie darauf auch nicht ausgelegt ist.Alles in allem ist es aber definitiv eine gute SSD, die sauber und schnell arbeitet und auch zu einem sehr günstigen Preis angeboten wird.Daher gibt es von mir hierfür insgesamt 4 Sterne.', 'Eine M.2 PCIe 3.0 SSD mit gutem Preis-/Leisungsverhältnis für einfache und sekundäre Zwecke.Der Hersteller gibt 100 TBW Schreibleistung an, aber nichts zum Chiptyp - was angesichts der recht mickrigen TBW jedoch vermutlich QLC sein dürfte.

Da ich im PC keinen M2-Slot mehr frei habe und ich die SSD als externes Drive nutzen wollte, habe ich mir ein stickartiges Gehäuse von Eluteng dazu geholt. Damit kommt die SSD auf 941 MB/s bzw. 935 MB/s; wobei das Gehäuse der limitierende Faktor ist.FaZit: Der Preisunterschied zu einer namhafteren PCIe-SSD liegt zwischen 10 und 30€, je nach Marktlage.

Der Test wurde unter LInux - Laufwerke durchgeführt+ sehr gutes Preis/Leistungsverhältnis- keine derzeit erkennbar', 'Die SSD kommt in einer Papierverpackung und kommt ohne unnötigen Plastikmüll aus, das ist immer erfreulich.Einbau ist sehr einfach und in wenigen Minuten erledigt.Mein System hat die SSD sofort erkannt und Windows 10 konnte ohne weiteres installiert werden.Auf dem Screenshot sieht man meine gemessenen Geschwindigkeiten, das kann sich schon sehen lassen.

Definitely worth the value and performance to switch to a M.2 instead of the mechanical SSD. Delivery was so fast and it arrived 2 days after i ordered it.

However, as it turned out the overall quality impression isn't exactly great. Yes, it's metal, but the workmanship is quite rough. The sled is made from sheet metal and has some pretty rough edges to it which is something I would not expect for that price.What's worse, though, is that the rear SFF8639 connector is of such poor quality that standard U.2 NVME cables (which sit snug on any other SFF8639 connector!) on the MB601VK sit so lose that the cable easily detaches by itself (I tried three different cables, all brand name). There is also no mechanical support for that connector. I guess this is why I had intermittent connections.In the end I decided to return the Icy Dock MB601VK and instead bought a Syba SY-MRA25059 U.2 dock instead, which  did cost only £29.32 so less than half of the Icy Dock MB601VK.

However, I did notice a sharp drop in write speeds when I was migrating my games library - down as low as 480MB/s. Apparently this is due to the SLC cache - once it's full, it can handle only so much. But when it clears, it ramps back up until it's full again. And so the cycle continues.I bought this specifically for gaming. And games (except for the initial install and any updates/DLCs) are all about read speeds. Considering I'm coming from a 550/480 read/write SSD, this was a major improvement. And a cost-effective upgrade as well, as I got this on sale for CDN$250!Now I would not recommend this for content creators or any other professionals who need to continually manipulate and move large quantities of data (i.e. video editors, game developers, hi-fi music/sound effects producers, etc). Do a little more research (and spend a hell of a lot more money) for an NVMe SSD that's far more suitable for your workload.With existing games and new titles becoming increasingly data-heavy due to expansive and immersive content, I highly recommend getting at least a 1TB SSD.

Twice, disk utility failed to recognize the drive.  Method 2 is to download an entire OS (6+ gigs for Mojave) and make a bootable USB.  When I proceeded by this method, disk utility saw the new drive, formatted it, and from there I could finish with a restoration from a time machine backup.

Motivo delle 5 stelle mancate è che ho provato in tutti i modi a comandare il LED con AuraSyn , Gigabyte RGB Fusion 2.0 ma nulla , non c'è verso di dare impostazioni ai colori o addirittura poterli spegnere , fanno sempre la loro sequenza standard , cambiano colore a intermittenza . Prima dell'acquisto avevo posto alcune domande a chi era già in possesso di questo ssd e molti mi confermarono che era possibile gestire il LED con AuraSyn o altri software e tuttora non so se le risposte ricevute siano veritiere , ma chissà forse sono io che sbaglio qualcosa nella gestione dei componenti . Comunque tornando al discorso dell'ssd , come prestazioni e designer , nulla da dire , pagato 109 euro e li merita tutti , considerando che ha un dissipatore per il raffreddamento e il LED Aorus .

Reformatted the sshd and all was great, boot time is now 9 seconds. The 512gb ex950 states 3,500 and 2,000 read write speed. I did numerous tests and all I am getting is 2,735 and 1,940. I see older ex920 nvme getting 3,000 so I know something is off. The HP ex950 does not come with any software or info how to get software like driver updates.

Under the nvme win10 says best driver installed, but date on driver is from 2006. I found drivers on MultiPointe website that has the HP 920 and 950 drivers and 920 firmware. But I am confused on how to install it. I attempted to update the drivers with these and my first attempt the ex950 would not boot up, went to blue win screen and nothing I tried could get me back into windows, so I just re cloned the original m.2 ssd. I believe this nvme can do stated speeds, I seen speed tests that say this ex950 is overall fastest nvme available right now, but no customer support is bad. This EX950 I can't even find on HP website. If I fix the drivers I will update this review. I would not say not to buy this, but can't give 5 stars due to poor support. Every other manufacturer has ssd tool software. The speeds I am getting are Fast, don't get me wrong, just a little more like advertised and I would be happy. Now price vs performance this is probably the best deal out there for a nvme m.2 out there. I can live with a little slower speeds and honestly in real every day use I might not even notice a the lower speed, but if you buy something that claims one thing and you see another, I expect what the claim is(at least close to claimed speeds), if HP would update drivers using the HP update software it would sell much more of these. Never understood a company that puts so much into making a great product and ruins it by not providing a simple way to update or get info.

My INITIAL experience (15 minutes of use) with my MacPro Desktop 2019 is that unlike the Sonnet Fusion, it supports booting from both drives and seems as fast as the Sonnet Fusion. Unfortunately it is not all good news:The card feels cheaply madeIt is not a full length card so not support by the back slot, lacks non-contact \'finger\'s for additional slot support, and does not lock into place in the slot. For slot stability it requires the screw in board clamp to be in place.Support is non-existent. Four attempts to reach pre-sales tech support using three different methods failed to elicit any kind of a response.Absolutely no documentation or instructions are supplied with the card. Absolutely no paperwork of any kind other than a \'thank you\' business card for purchase and registration with a 10% discount for additional purchases. The only thing in the box  was this card, the SSD securing screws, a mini disk I verified contained a WINDOWS DRIVER, THAT CLAMXAV INDICATED WAS INFECTED WITH A WINDOWS VIRUS,  and the actual card.

A screwdriver to attach the drives was all I needed.One hiccup I encountered with my Dell BIOS is this does not initially appear as a bootable device. During one test, I wanted to just use one of the two drives as a Win-10 disk. For this to work, enable ""Legacy Option ROMs"" and it will boot, however in UEFI mode, I still get the ""no bootable devices found"" Press F1 to continue, and the system boots from this card. One day I\'ll figure this out, and it may work differently with other motherboard BIOS.', ""I'm using 2 x 2TB on this card in a PCIE x 16 (running at x 8) slot.

But don't expect this x 1 card to be running at 1GB/s."", ""Due the different lines information was placed on in the Amazon posting, it didn't pop out before I made the purchase.HUGE CON: PCIe Gen 2 x1 (again, this is on different lines)Meaning: It advertises support for 2x 6Gbps SATA drives, what you will actually get however is MUCH LOWER!Context: You will always have overhead, so your BEST SATA SSD 6Gbps drive will get around 550MBps out of the 600MBps theoretical max, so you figure that x2 with this card?NOPE!For whatever reason, instead of Gen3 x1 or using Gen2 2x link, its a PCIe Gen 2 x1 link which is limited to 5Gbps or 500MBps theoretical, now, add on top of that overhead, and you get 400MBps MAX TO ONE, or even LESS split between both.Testing Setup: 2x 256GB Samsung 840 Pro SSD's, individual speed direct to SATA is about 480-500MBps READ and 430-460MBps WRITE, ok great! Now, with both plugged in, and the latest driver from mid 2020 (older ones where tested as well), you will MAX get 400MBps to ONE of the drives, if you try to do BOTH at the same time, one will drop to 125MBps and the other 250MBps (tested multiple times, different drivers, and different SSD's as well, this is a literal unbalance situation) or roughly 375MBps, so that drops further during the test so even BELOW the TESTED 400MBps with a single drive.All of this is the fault of the chosen controller which is an ASM1061 which is a PCIe Gen2 x1 link, a 2010 chip Sedna is still making today... and using in several of their other products...Bottom line, if your looking to use this with an SSD or SSD's, DONT STAY AWAY RUN FAR, Should be fine for regular HDD as you generally wont surpass 250MBps pre cache exhaustion on even 2020 HDD's."", ""I'll admit, I was a bit nervous after purchasing this device and reading all of the reviews about buggy drivers and incompatibilities.I bought this because my power supply wouldn't supply power to my hard drives for whatever reason, and I was intending to set up a RAID 0 configuration for caching games to a local server.I'm happy to report that this was super simple to install in my rig. For Ubuntu it was pretty much plug and play. My bios recognized the drives, and so did Ubuntu. I did some configuring to create my RAID and mounted them in Ubuntu, and they are working flawlessly. No extra driver installs or anything.Also the PCP was black on mine like in the pictures.I will definitely buy this again in the future if I need more storage in my caching server."", ""The interface is PCI Express 2.0 x1 which is at most 500MB/s speeds. That's barely enough for one good SSD so you're not going to get any good speeds at all if you're trying to use two SSDs on there at once. Even copying from one to the other.I should have read the description, now I have a expensive PCB for scrap."", ""The Adapter itself is super easy to install. I simply installed the drivers first, shut down the pc, and plugged it into the 1st PCIe slot. After a quick boot priority change in the BIOS, it worked as expected! I haven't noticed any dips in load performance and being able to just move this to another motherboard when I finally decide to upgrade is a major plus for me. The only thing I can complain about is the fact that they shipped me a Green PCB instead of a Black PCB (like the ones in the advertised pictures) Kinda clashes with the black color in my case.

Comes with appropriate screws for my use in a Dell Laptop. It's been running a new installation of Windows 10 Home for two months now without issues.The Long: Most laptops now make it relatively easy to upgrade/expand hard drives. The difficulty is usually if you want this as a boot/OS drive especially on older models. In specific, I got this for a Dell Inspiron 17R - Model 5720 (Intel i5-3210M) laptop running Windows 10 Home. BEFORE you install this mSata/SSD - make sure you are running the latest BIOS version regardless if you make it boot or not!!! To make it boot from the mSata/SSD requires a few more steps. Proceed below for general steps to determine if this is for you.Model Specific Installation: The Dell Inspiron 5720. New Windows 10 Install. First, I must state that I tried imaging the old drive to the new. Works but performance issues [I checked TRIM settings and what not as well as I have advanced computer knowledge] (mostly probably coz of old apps and the way it was upgraded from Windows 8). Pull out old HDD while leaving mSata/SSD installed. Install operating system. When Windows reboots the 1st time, go into the Bios, Customize boot to mSata. Search forums for specifics - I think Dell Community has some pages. Make sure you can boot. Reinstall old HDD. And see if it boots to the mSata/SSD. Adjust Bios as necessary. I have reinstalled Win10 a couple of times since then and I can now install directly to the mSata/SSD without removing the HDD. But it took a few tries in the Bios before I got this right. It's just easier w/o the old HDD when you first configure it.WARNING: I booted to the old drive to retrieve some encrypted data and copied it directly to the SSD. Rebooted to the mSata and well... I had to reinstall the whole OS all over again. The HDD old windows 10 build (pre 1903) prolly did something to the SSD new build (post 1903 build) and bla bla blah. The Lesson: Make sure to download/copy/transfer ALL your data. I highly recommend reformatting the old HDD or remove it completely (I did the latter and installed a high rpm hdd for data). Or else avoid booting into the OLD HDD period!!!"", ""I bought the 512 GB version of this a few years ago to replace the HD on an older laptop. It worked fine but just died one day. I reinstalled the old HD and relegated the laptop to a specific niche use. The original HD has some issues and the laptop would periodically lock up. Got fed up and decided to check on another SSD. Found the 256GB version for a bit over $30 so I thought I'd give it another try. Loaded it up and installed it and it works so far. Only been a couple of days but no lockups of the computer. We'll see if this one dies in a year or two also. For the price it's worth another shot."", 'I have ordered and installed 5 of these in Dell Latitude E7240 laptops. 2 of the drives are loaded with Ubuntu Linux for when I want to switch to that OS, and one with Ubuntu has been hard at work in Tanzania since before the pandemic, with no issues. mSATA drives are now obsolete, but if you need a replacement for general usage, these work nicely.', ""What's the difference between the mSATA M3 and Q3 versions? Basically, the SSD controller is the same (SM2258XT), but the flash memory chips are apparently Intel in the Zheino Q3, and Sandisk in te Zheino M3. Of these two, the M3 appears to be a little faster reading, but the Q3 is a little faster at writing. However, both M3 and Q3 use a DRAM-less design, which means that under sustained write load (such as when restoring this SSD from a backup), the write rate is initially fast, but after some time, it will eventually drop to around 28MB/s for the M3 model, and around 38MB/s for the Q3 model - see attached images. This is slower than MLC mSATA SSDs, which will sustain write speeds of 110MB/s from start to end. However, such long writes are uncommon in normal usage, so therefore it should not matter quite as much. This slow down of the write throughput should also be less pronounced if there are pauses in between the writes, and if there is some unallocated space for over-provisioning. For comparison, I am providing benchmark tests for M3, Q3, and LiteON L9M models, all 128GB in AHCI mode. So in conclusion, the M3 is a decent performer, it disappoints a bit in terms of sustained write rates, but it's still a good value, I think."", ""I've been using the Zheino mSATA SSD 128GB as the boot drive for my DIY Linux Router for almost 2 years now, and I must say that I am pretty happy with my choice of this SSD.Although the performance of this drive isn't stellar compared to some of the more expensive options out there, it is definitely cost-effective, and that is a huge plus for me.  One of my initial concerns with this SSD was its write endurance, but it has held up well over time, and I haven't experienced any issues so far. This is especially important for me, as I rely on this SSD to run my home's router and if it failed, I'd be without Internet access.Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase of the Zheino mSATA SSD 128GB. It has proven to be a reliable and cost-effective option for my needs, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a similar solution."", 'I have 6 years old Dell XPS 13 L321X and I did not want to erase Win 7 in order to install Win 10, just in case Win 7 is better than Win 10 on XPS 13. So I purchased Zheino mSATA for that purpose. I swapped the SSD and installed Win 10 on Zheino SSD and the drive worked perfectly. The speed was as advertised (Read 500MB/s, Write 450MB/s). There is another version of same drive which has the write speed of 120MB/s - this is M1 mSATA. My drive is M3 mSata, so make sure you get M3 model . As for XPS 13 L321X, Win 7 is definitely better - the fan is quiet and fast. Win 10 is fast as well, but you really cannot tell the difference - except the fan noise is much louder and noticeable. Also Zheino company has upgraded their website, some still visit old one which has no update and no support. Their new website is: zheinossd.com. Overall I am very satisfied.', ""So I bought this drive as an upgrade for an HP Stream 14 laptop.  For the record, you can swap out the internal wifi card with a very small form factor solid state drive, then set the laptop up for Network Boot and replace the now-missing wifi card with an external USB wifi adapter (there are directions online--be very, very careful when you're working inside the open guts of your lappy).  Too late, I found that this card is just a little too big to do that with.So, I bought an mSATA to USB 3.0 adapter and decided to use it as an external SSD.  Upon plugging it into my laptop, I found that the device didn't show up, though all indicator LEDs were lit.  After a bit of finagling through Device Manager, I was easily able to mount a simple partition to it.  The device now works pretty much as intended. :)While my original plan was a no-go, it seems to do fine as an external USB drive.  Also, do keep in mind that neither this drive nor the adapter has an external casing, so either rig up some sort of case for it, or commit to handling it very carefully."", ""Perfetto usato su un ASRock Beebox N3000.Un mini PC con CPU Celeron N3000 fanless che deve fare solo da web server con Ubuntu Linux 14.04 per una decina di siti poco trafficati.Questo SSD è stato pensato per piccole applicazioni client o server come POS o servizi come un web server, DNS server, router o NAS.La velocità non è eccezionale ma ottima per caricare il sistema operativo in una manciata di secondi ed un veloce accesso ai dati.La velocità di scrittura invece è molto bassa simile ad un hard disk meccanico, ma in questo genere di applicazioni la scrittura non è attività critica, si registrano solo log e poco altro.La tipologia di uso a cui è indirizzato è specificata, ed io l'ho acquistato consapevole di questo uso.Non è un SSD per l'uso su computer per la produttività personale.Tolti 2GB di swap, 4GB per il sistema operativo e circa 11GB per i siti internet, mi rimangono circa 12 GB liberi per log e attività di lavoro, scompattazione, backup, aggiornamento del sistema ecc.La misura necessaria alla mia applicazione, senza sprechi, costato meno di 24 euro.Se a fine vita della sua applicazione sarà ancora funzionante i prossimi 4-5 anni, lo riciclerò per qualche altra piccola applicazione di servizio."", ""I purchased this for use in a QOTOM Q535G6 network appliance computer. This will also work in the related models Q555G6 and Q575G6 (only difference in these models is the CPU: I3, I5, and I7).This was easy to install. It comes with a retaining screw in case your system doesn't have one.Just a reminder that this is mSATA, not M.2; they are completely different form factors.The 128GB and 256GB sizes are a good value if you're looking for an OS boot drive for a network appliance type system that uses mSATA.""]"

Stay away unless you are prepared with constant backups.

It appears to be the next version of the 970 EVO, and is OEM supported (does not have Samsung support). It is an excellent drive and has the Phoenix controller, not Polaris. I used this part # because it is the 1 TB version of the 512 GB drive that came in my Lenovo Ideapad 720S – meaning the existing drivers would work.I backed up the 512 GB disk1 and restored to this 1TB drive (4 partitions - one was a FAT32/BIOS-UEFI partition). This turned out to be more difficult than I imagined, due to several factors: Windows 10, Acronis Disk Director 12, and a 4K Very High resolution 15"" laptop screen. Outside of the Windows 10 environment, getting cues to display correctly on the very high resolution monitor was impossible. Also, getting the settings correct using Acronis True Image 2019 were challenging because the drive is formatted GPT, not MBR, and uses the Intel Rapid Storage Technology environment in RAID mode to support Optane. Once the initial load was complete, I had issues that made me suspect that Windows 10 was not configured correctly. Attempted to use Acronis Disk Director 12 to clear and reformat the drive (booting from a USB WinPE drive that included the partition software), but it was unable to change anything – couldn’t get to the boot agent to restart and apply changes. Found an AOMEI Partition Manager that could clear the drive without rebooting and was able to start over. But. The USB was running just the basic AOMEI Partition Manager and, not having a Windows display manager running caused the cue text to appear in a size 4 font, which was readable if you were very young or very nearsighted. Many pop-up windows could not be resized enough to see the text in them!  I eventually cleared the drive, got it into GPT mode, and restored my 4th set of backup images.

I knew very little about the EX920 beforehand but I was in the market for a 1TB SSD and immediately went to the 960 EVO like everyone else in the market. However the 1TB 960 EVO was $450 at the time of this review. The HP Ex920 popped up for a paltry $370 for 1TB drive. I had to triple check all of the specs to make sure it was indeed a NVME drive or that there are no hidden issues that would come up. To my surprise, reviews for this drive are all very positive. Performance is on par with the 960 EVO and creeps up into 960 PRO category for certain performance metrics.The chips themselves are Micron/Crucial 64-layer 3D TLC NANDs and the memory are NANYA chips. Both of these are leaders in the SSD/memory game. The controller is Silicon Motion SM2262, the same controller found in many brands of SSDs including Intel. On paper, the HP EX920 does many things right, 3200 reads, 1800 writes. To my surprise, my tests confirmed the specifications.I honestly can't find anything wrong with this drive. Packing was premium, the specs are good, and blazing speeds at $80 less than the leading player in the market. The SSD even has a tiny red LED on the chip to let you know it's reading/writing like old hard drives used to do. This is a nice feature absent from many solid state drives. Helps let you know if your drive is working or not.The only thing I would say is they should have included a heat sink to dispel heat. The 960 series for example, had a copper sticker on the rear to dissipate heat. I honestly don't know if this drive has an overheating problem but consecutive tests don't show a major decrease in performance so far.Kudos HP for knocking it out of the park!***EDIT DEC 2018***My drive is still performing wonderfully. However I recently purchased another one from Best Buy on Ebay for my desktop and the temperature shows a constant 54 Degrees C on the SMART sensors. My original drive that I purchased here on Amazon reviewed here, shows the temperatures changing according to load as it shoud. Apparently all of the new EX920 SSDs from around September/October 2018 and on have been exhibiting this issue. It's not a real temperature overheating problem, just stuck. Many online said it was due to a firmware issue. Thew new firmware is SVN139B and the old firmware SVN101 works fine. My SSD is on a desktop with a heat sink on top and fans creating airflow so I doubt it will ever overheat. However until this issue gets resolved by HP, you may run into this issue with newer versions of this drive as well.***EDIT JAN 2019***There is a new firmware update available now MultiPointe, HP's third party partner version 2262 B16 Update that fixes the temperature issue. I can't link on Amazon, but searching onlien for EX920 firmware update will get you to the right place. After updating, my temps for my 1TB drive (with a heatsink on in a desktop computer) were around 20 degrees which is pretty great. Good luck!"", ""DISLIKES :  HP has no driver support for this NVME .  Should of had software to update its own firmware .  I used it as a boot drive,  Windows was difficult to Install.  Had to change settings in  bios.  This drive was no faster than my  sata 2.5 ssd that i replaced.  This M.2 drive wiggles in the MB  slot.  Apparently its to thin on the screw end.  The screw bottoms out,  Tried numerous M.2 screws,  same thing.  Moved to new slot same thing,  LOOSE!!!!!  This movement caused numerous headaches during the rest off the build.  Kept loosing boot drive.On to the performance.  I couldn't tell a difference in speed.  Maybe the drive needed updated...???  HP support is seriously lacking for this product.  I had to google  this ssd  to find a person who bought this to get a link to a website that had a firmware update.  No  Info in the package it came in!!!!!!!!!!!!  hope you can find it.One review compared this to the Samsung 970 EVO  Plus.  It  just so happened I had one that i just installed in another build..  I wiped the drive clean and replaced  the HP ssd.  reinstalled windows .  loaded drivers for the samsung  .  The difference  was  like night and day  for me.  way faster boot times,  web page loading.  bench marks.  absolutely  No  buffering  while  streaming.  Should of stuck with  proven  results.  learned the hard way."", ""4 stars may be due to my specific main board which is only providing PCI-E 3x2 - was expecting speeds on the order of 1600 due to the above, however cannot get beyond what a SATA drive can offer: only getting ~ 650 maxing out for reads and about the same for writes (using the CDM 64-bit latest). On top of that the drive was not recognized by the HP firmware utility at all. Otherwise the drive works with no fuss. It's not particularly slow that I noticed, but the benchmark numbers are not great. Contrary to what some were writing, Intel drivers cannot be installed either as the drive is not detected by Intel as well. Perhaps I'll re-flash the main board BIOS and try again."", ""I installed the 1TB model in my new Lenovo E485 and immediately saw a speed increase. The problem is that Lenovo has been known to be picky with certain M.2 devices, along with my AMD Ryzen/Vega chipset, I'm having a hard time figuring out what's causing my machine to BSOD, hang, or reboot for no reason.I thought that I'd check the HP website to see if I could find an updated driver for the SSD. Well, their own website only sees the 256GB and 512GB models in their database. If you enter the P/N or S/N in their search, it doesn't know what it is. The problem is that the only way to contact support is to actually enter a valid part/serial match.So I have a 5-year warranty on a device that I can't even register, and as of now I'm stuck with a default Windows 10 driver (and I believe there must be a better one).The drive is fast. I'm sure in the right machine, it's flawless, fast, and perfect. I'm just not sure that my Lenovo is that machine."", 'Happy with purchase.', ""I bought this as my main drive to install my OS and main programs. It worked flawlessly for a little over a month, boot time was basically non-existent, it was like turning a TV on, immediate boot. Programs loaded without hesitation every time. I was definitely impressed.One day I went to turn the PC on and Windows took a really long time to boot (over 5 minutes), after the Sign-in page finally loaded, I noticed my background image was missing, so I thought something was wrong with my Windows. I put in my login information and my desktop didn't load at all, I just got a black screen in which I was able to move my mouse pointer around. I got to the task manager to see what's happening and see that Explorer.exe was not running, so I tried to start it manually, to no avail.I gave up on Windows after googling many possible causes and trying to fix it. So I got a Windows install bootable drive, plugged it in and restarted my PC. When I got to the installer I tried to format the drive and re-install Windows there, but it wouldn't allow me to select my drive for the installation. I again turned to Google for help, and some forums suggested my drive might be configured as read-only, so I tried removing this setting, again, to no avail. The issues persisted. I tried everything. I tried a few diagnostics tools from the Hiren's Boot Disk and they all froze when I tried selecting this drive (even though they worked with other drives), so I couldn't even diagnose the problem. This is when I decided contacting Amazon about this problem.Amazon told me to contact HP and try to solve it and if not, they would take care of it. So I did. When I called HP they were impressed I wasn't using the drive on an HP computer, and kept telling me to run the HP UEFI diagnostic tools by pressing some key combination during boot, which of course doesn't exist on my AsRock motherboard. So I kept telling them that I wasn't able to because I'm not using an HP computer. They then told me to contact Amazon again because my unit must be faulty.Well, here comes the fun part, I live in the Dominican Republic, and I've been an Amazon Prime customer for years. I ship my stuff to an address in Miami from which my stuff is shipped to the DR. After struggling for so long with this drive, Amazon refused to deal with my problem because the item left the US. The only reason they gave me was that the item left the country. So I lost my money and my trust in Amazon. Hope you're happy, Amazon, I won't be renewing my Prime membership this year and I will most definitely start looking at another sites to spend my hard earned money."", ""Powered by sm2262 with excellent SLC caching algorithm, ex920 really surprises me with its qd1~qd4 4k read as well as its well-performed SEQ read.

Surprisingly, switching my previous NVME, Adata sx8000, to EX920  boosts up my booting speed ~ 1.6 times!Despite the splendid feature mentioned above,  consumers may find themselves difficult to find the official support on the HP webpage.  Although it has 5 years warranty -same as its competitor, sx8200 and 760p-, the lack of official support page of ex920 will truly be a disadvantage...It seems that you should contact either HP's laptop or accessory department for EX920's support.One more important thing for those who use this NVME:Since ex920 has similar architecture to the Intel 760p, their driver could be applied on the ex920 as well.

My setup consists of rack style removable 2.5-inch form factor SSD's for my two workstations.I am not very impressed with the 870 series at all. I have two 870's and one of them developed issues after only several months of service. Also, just reading some of the bad reports on the internet about the 870's has turned me off.

The laptop gradually got slower and slower (you know the 3-5 mins to boot up, 2-3 mins to shut down kind of thing) so I decided to go the SSD route.Initially upgraded the laptop with a 500Gb Crucial MX500 SSD but then saw a good offer for the 860 EVO.  The Crucial SSD had Windows 10 on (clean install using the Windows 7 key) and all of my usual programs (M$ Office, Gadwin Print Screen, VLC Media Player) and my WiFi printers configured so all I needed to do was clone this drive to the new Samsung Drive.Plugging the 860 EVO into an external USB interface allowed me to clone the MX500 to the 860 EVO.  I have used Acronis True Image for years but encountered a problem last year where it wouldn't detect a second internal m.2 SSD in another laptop and I was directed to use Macrium Reflect 7 (which is free).  No problem sorting out the m.2 cloning.  Anyway, back to the 860 EVO.Macrium Refelect allows you to easily (using drag and drop) to move the partitions from one drive to another.  This is important if upgrading from a smaller to larger hard drive - and this is why.  If you make sure that the C: drive (or whatever drive/partition is to be used for data) is the LAST partition (i.e. the right-most one) with empty unallocated space to the right, you can extend the partition (either during the cloning procedure or later on in Disk Management) which enables you to use the whole of the new drive (i.e. you are able to use the extra space that you've paid for).IMPORTANT:  Before undertaking the cloning procedure, use Macrium Reflect to make a Rescue Disk *FIRST*This will enable you to sort out a boot problem if after cloning you find that your new SSD won't boot.  (go to Backup Tab.Click on the 'Other Tasks' tab, click Create Rescue media --> select your device (CD/DVD or USB) --> 'Advanced' --> Click on 'Choose Base WIM' tab, click on 'Windows 10 PE (WADK)', click 'OK' click 'Build'.  This puts a 'lite' version of Windows on the rescue media (Windows PE for those interested) and the various drivers for your pc.One final note, it takes quite a while to make the Rescue Media so be patient!Cloning:To clone the MX500 to the 860 EVO took around 45 mins in total.Swap the drives over (the internal MX500 --> external USB and the 860 EVO --> internal) and re-boot.It *should* boot into Windows fine.  If not, shut down the pc, insert your rescue media (see above) and boot from the rescue media into Macrium Reflect (note this may take several minutes of looking at a black screen!)  Once booted, select the 'Restore' tab then 'Fix Windows Boot Problems'.I bought two of these 1Tb 860 EVO SSDs - one cloned without a problem and happily booted into Windows at the first attempt whilst the second (in a different machine) needed the 'Fix Windows Boot Problems' noted above.Now to the drives themselves.They are fast(*) and have a large capacity.  You can download (from Samsung) the SSD Magician software which allows you to monitor the state of the SSD and optimise it for your use.  *DON'T use this software to clone your existing drive*  Make sure that you click on 'Over Provisioning' in the Magician software and set the OP to 10% (this will increase the life of the SSD dramatically).*Benchmarking this drive (using Crystal Disk Mark) showed that the main 'bottleneck' was the interface in these older laptops - so you won't get the advertised 550/520 MB/s speeds - except in recent pcs that use the SATA III interface.  Both the Crucial MX500 and 860 EVO topped out at 284/266 MB/s which is about right for SATA II.Whilst this is a review of the 1Tb Samsung 860 EVO, I have given detailed instructions as to how to clone your existing installation to help others.There's not much to say about the drive itself other than it is large and fast and I can thoroughly recommend it.""]"

I checked Task Manager while copying, and the 'Response Time' of the SSD explained it all.Also, as you can see, while copying, in the pics tagged 'COPY', the SSD is going %100, and the HDD is like 36-70%, which is... not how it's supposed to be at all.. the SSD should be writing waaaaay faster than the HDD reads.And, as you can see, the copying speed was consistent around 116MB/s, which is low, it should be around 165MB/s (max HDD read speed).But anyhow, when I tried reading the files of another game from origin (when you discover existing files of a game), the SSD gave me expected performance, as you can with pics tagged with 'ORIGIN INSTALL'. */"", ""I have been using a lot of Silicon Power SSD's lately, and they have held up very well.

Granted, if you have easy access to the drive bay and have no problem checking on it at time.  Then the cheaper ones are the way to go.  I went with this cause it's got no plastic.  And it's being placed in a device where I have to do a major teardown to get to the drive, if there's any issues.  I installed this in my Mac Mini G4.  Which, compared to the old iBooks, is a cake walk.  But still, I rather install it, forget it.Also, do research on data storage.  There are a lot out there that seem too good to be true on price.  And they burn up real quick.  Sometimes right that moment.  Other times, months later.  Buying a good SSD and using this will be a good investment to add more life to your old device.  Though don't expect performance to be up to what ever the SSD you installed.  It will only go up to the speed of the IDE controller you have on your machine.  This will just give you smooth data movement without the delay and sound of a hard drive platter spinning.  Which is nice.  Especially since those old IDE HDD were loud during their day, compared to modern HDD."", 'I have quite a few of these, maybe a dozen, and like them a lot. I never had any problem with one, or at least never thought I did. I use these in both Windows boxes and Linux servers, and they\'re pretty much set and forget, well that\'s the theory anyway. So recently I reused a box that had been a Linux box and installed Windows on it, I wanted it to be essentially a clone of another box, which also had one of these in it, so I removed one of the SSDs from the source box and put it in the new box and then wiped 2 more SSDs to mirror to, one for each box. All worked great, seemingly, I had two boxes that were essentially clones of each other. Then I ran the utility software to make sure the mirrors to the unallocated SSDs happened as expected. Source system? no problem. The clone, well no, just a controller listed, no SSDs at all. swapped the SSDs side to side,, doesn\'t boot. swapped them into another of these carriers and everything then works as expected.So it\'s one bad one, no biggy right? well no, it\'s not that simple. This can be used as a driverless product and on Linux that is the only option, and this is how this particular one had been used for a couple years. When did it stop recognizing the 2nd SSD? No idea. There was no fault light lit on it, it didn\'t stop seeing the primary drive, just stopped seeing the secondary, and this is bad.Using these is insurance, and using them on an OS that doesn\'t see them is trust, and if that diagnostic indicator LED doesn\'t detect a fault in the board itself, well that\'s trust in something that might not be trustable. I would much rather the product fail completely then fail but seemingly be fine. Fact is there was no mirror there, and for how long, I have no idea, everything appeared fine. I won\'t stop using them, I won\'t stop buying them, I just ordered a replacement for that bad one in fact, but I know now that periodically swapping out an SSDs then switching them side to side a wile later is required to really be able to trust them (or just swap them around so that they can be verified with the Windows utility).I always try to use SSDs with different histories in my mirrors to prevent simultaneous failures, which is a real problem with mirrored SSDs as with identical writes will tend to fail very near to each other. All the SSDs I use in these are all identical Samsung EVOs and as boot drives I\'ve actually never had one fail, although as media drives I\'ve lost several and no longer use them that way. So risk is actually probably fairly minimal, but as th old Russian proverb says ""Doveryai, no proveryai"" Trust but verify.', ""I have a 15 year old Dell 700m laptop that I really liked. It has apps that I accidentally  deleted from other PCs plus some apps that don't run well on WIN 10 in compatibility mode.  It was too old for a Chromebook upgrade. It was  not upgradable to WIN 7.  The BIOS did not support AHCI and would run the mSATA transparently thru the IDE/PATA interface .  I had a 32Gb mSata card pulled from another laptop, found the Ableconn IIDE-mSATA and  figured  that I could put the mSATA in the Ableconn, connect it to a 44pin USB 2.0 adapter that I had and connected it to the Dell.  It worked, I was able to format the mSATA and I bought a 128Gb mSATA card (Zheino M3), repeated the effort on the larger mSATA.  I had to buy AEOMI Backupper Pro ($39; the freebee won't clone a disc) and replicated the 80Gb Hitachi HDD.  Installed the Ableconn w/mSATA in the 700m. It replaced Hitachi HDD perfectly, no need for the provided screws. It booted immediately, ran beautifully for a day, then slowed down. the barely ran. Pulled the mSATA and did some homework: Removed the master/slave jumpers from the Ableconn, left the unused portion of the mSATA unformatted, (I had created a partition in this space)  and downloaded SSD Tweaker (free) to set the WIN XP parameters for optimum SSD performance.Re-Cloned the HDD > mSATA, reinstalled in the  700m and the PC has been running beautifully since.  Not sure what fixed the original problem but its 20 sec to Logon, another 20 sec to useful work.  Outlook 2007 takes a long time to startup, but then just fine.  It's not as fast as native mSATA since its running thru the 44pin EIDE interface but its a much more useful PC and I don''t dread the wait time when I boot it up. I also upgraded to SSD Tweaker Pro ( $9) get the Trim function. This cost more than expected, primarily due to the software needed. I consider the Ableconn IIDE-mSATA adapter an elegant solution to providing longevity to an old,still  useful and I will say it, a beloved PC.PS: After a day of heavy use I had another recurrence with  the slowdown at startup and was going to revert to the HDD, left it to do the next day. When I sat down to revert to the HDD, just to check, I pressed power and the 700m booted up immediately and ran with no problems. I'm not sure what the problem was but recall an  old  item I read online: letting a PC with an SDD 'idle' before shutdown, say after Windows logoff, so it can reorganize itself. (Finnicky little devils aren't they?) Also my battery is only good for an hour + so the 700m is usually plugged in, which might get power to the mSATA before the OS is up.  Either way, I am satisfied with the Ableconn, it did the job."", 'I tried a cheaper mSATA/IDE adapter and while other computers to read and write to the mSATA, the Apple iBook G4 (circa 2005) did not recognize it.Remove your old IDE drive and add a IDE-USB adapter, then use linix dd commend to make a drive image. Then take a mSATA and insert it into this adapter, then add a USB to IDE adapter, you can use linux dd to write the image.At that point, you can install this adapter/mSATA card into your old computer, it should boot up, and you are done. I used a Kingston 256GB mSATA. Even with an IDE ATA-100 interface, going solid state will have everything load three times faster, double the data transfer rate, and reduce seek times to negligible levels. These measurements are compared to an old Samsung 2.5"" 160GB hard drive on an Apple iBook G4.', 'Pros:* Only needs 5V to operate both NGFFs, it does not need 12V from the SATA port  (unlike the QNAP-A2MAR)* Software configurable or Hardware Jumper configurable.  (Win/Mac configurable tool seems little more better than other competing brands)* Open Frame, for those who wish to install heatsinks (QIVYNSRY M.2 2280 heatsink fits side-by-side)* Dual NGFF slots* RAID / SPAN mode configurableCons:They cheeped out two standoffs to properly secure the main circuit board down (opposite side of SATA port), the main circuit board will not be flush-aligned with the side frames.The M.2 SSD slots are too close to each other, paper thin margin tolerance side-by-side spacingThe M.2 slots are not in the centered, this may be a problem for some users, in my case I can only fit one out of the two slots that I really needed for.Summary:There is a design flaw with 4 screws mounting so  close to the SATA port. circuit board might tilt on far end.  Is it really that hard to properly engineer 4 screws in all 4 corners? seriously!', 'Form factors seem to change for many instruments at shorter intervals nowadays. It\'s conceivable that in the not-too-distant future internal SSDs won\'t be made in the rectangular enclosures which have been predominant; a changeover to the smaller form factor of mSATA, m.2 NGFF SATA  & ever-evolving small-form plug-ins will predominate, to fit into the slimmer laptop PCs which have been gaining an increasing presence in stores, & in users\' hands. There are too many fine older-form laptops with strong user allegiance (including this reviewer), and Ablecomm is one of a few makers of adapters which will put the newer \'SSD\'s on cards\', so to speak, into the typical size PC\'s of most recent (and, some older) build. What makes Ablecomm\'s adapter for the 2.5"" SATA space a champ is a combo of features: 1. its solid aluminum frame; 2. it has room for either a mini-size mSATA drive, or a M.2 NGFF \'long-stick\'-shape SSD, resembling a RAM form for desktop PC\'s. You can insert both types at the same time, but only the M.2 form will operate. The only reservation I have about this item is that it is \'open-shell\', like a car chassis with no body. However, the SSD cards will fit snugly, in any event. I\'ve used another version of this to insert a SSD into an IDE-form Dell Inspiron 600m (an old workhorse from around 2004, along with its Vostro equivalent). I\'m going to use Ablecomm\'s contender in a few Inspiron 15\'s at home. All in all, Ablecomm has made a quality item, soon to become a necessity for those of us who fight the good fight against planned obsolescence --successfully.', 'Only downside was this was only available from the USA but works very well with a Transcend 128Gb SSD', ""I have tried the white adapter which are abundantly available from ebay and it caused my Satellite A70-S259 to lock up when formatting my 128gb Samsung msata drive during Windows 7 32 bit home premium installation. So I tried the clone method which seemed to work ok and had read speeds around 74mbps and write speeds around 69mbps. Then when it came to restarting the laptop it would lock up again but this time at the windows boot logo. Doing some more research I found that the generic white ebay adapters typically have the JMicron chipset in them which causes a lot of compatibility in issues between certain laptops and msata drives. One person from a forum recommended to purchase an adapter that has the Marvell chipset which this adapter does have. This adapter is pretty much identical the Aleratec version but sold out cause I waited too long to make a decision whether to invest into an old laptop. Thankfully this Ableconn's version worked out PERFECTLY and fit like a glove in my Toshiba! Windows installed fast and without a hitch! Now I'm getting 94mpbs and 77mbps writes speeds! Boot times are just over 15 seconds, outstanding! Boot time with the original IDE 60gb 4200 rpm hard drive was around 1 1/2 minutes. Get yours today as I worry about if these great adapters will be eventually be phased out as old technology relics of the past have. Was shipped quickly but unfortunately USPS decided to throw the packaged envelope on my front lawn and was buried underneath a few inches of snow from a storm that just rolled through that same day. Couldn't find it until 2 days later with a flashlight but obviously wasn't Ableconn's fault just the delivery person must have had a bad day I guess. Nonetheless, it survived being out in the cold and works flawlessly! Thank you Ableconn, your adapter is fairly priced and breathed new life into my gently used laptop! P.S. Keep making these things, I'm sure people will continue to buy them! Take care!"", ""The item arrived right on schedule. It was easy to put in a mSATA SSD, and the unit went into my 2005 PowerBook G4 easily. Because of the open framework of the adapter, I put a piece of electrical tape where the ribbon cable came in contact with the edge of the adapter to protect the cable from resting on the metal edge. The PowerBook booted right up in record speed and is running better than ever. I'm very happy with my purchase and will certainly buy another if the need arises."", 'This device worked flawlessly in a project I just completed replacing a 4.8GB Fujitsu 2.5"" IDE hard disk from 2001 in a giant CNC mill, which has a 486 Single-Board-Computer in an ISA slot running the vrtx32/386 real-time OS on top of MS-DOS for Embedded Systems! Yes, I said 486! Mind you that most mSATA cards would be far too large, and cause this ancient system\'s BIOS to choke, so the card I used was a 32GB model from Silicon Power, and I had to resize the ""apparent size"" of the card to make it look like a matching 4.8GB disk (the BIOS would have allowed a bit larger, but not much, and the mill is only using 200MB or so...)The important part is that this device, and the Silicon Power mSATA chip supported the ATA commandset enough to allow the resizing process (which I attempted and failed to do with CompactFlash, Disk on Modules, several IDE SSDs, etc). ""Resizing"" as I say it really just means creating a Host Protected Area (HPA) on the disk that the BIOS can\'t see, leaving behind the remainder in a size you want the system to see.I used hdparm for that: sudo hdparm -Np123456789 --yes-i-know-what-i-am-doing /dev/sd_X_With ""123456789"" being the LBA sector count that you want the drive to appear to have, and ""_X_"" being set to (a,b,c, etc for whichever disk this is)  Definitely, *do not* use these commands if you\'re not sure what you\'re doing, and definitely don\'t expect any data to remain intact on the card afterward (it might- but don\'t plan on it).']"

Hubba hubba!', 'I ordered this adapter because I had both Kubuntu 18.04 and Windows 10 experiencing intermittent freezing when using a Samsung 960 Pro NVMe M.2 SSD. That SSD was in a Gen.3 PCI Express M.2 slot on my GA-AB350M-DS3H motherboard: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079NH98GSI tried everything and thoroughly tested memory. Nothing helped. The system was not overclocked, and I had latest versions of both Kubuntu and Windows, and all chipset drivers installed.I then removed the M.2 SSD and attached a 2.5"" SATA SSD drive, installed Kubuntu andWindows on it, updated Windows to the latest versions and installed chipset drivers, after which both Kubuntu and Windows were stable.Then I decided to make sure the problem was with the M.2 interface, not with the NVMe drive itself, so I bought this adapter. After installing the NVMe drive into the adapter and sitting the adapter in a Gen.2 PCIEX4 slot (I could not intall Gen. 3 PCI Express slot because it is occupied by a video card) the system has been stable (I had to use UEFI boot menu to boot it), but of course, because it\'s a PCIEX4 slot, it operates at PCI Express 2.0 speed. So instead of 3200 MB/s read and 2100 MB/s  write speed that Samsung Magician measured with Gen. 3 PCI Express M.2 slot, I got only 1615 MB/s read and 1550 MB/s write speeds. So it looks like I need to RMA the motherboard. I will keep this adapter just in case - when I need to copy data from one drive to another, or to use it for an additional drive.It\'s been about an hour since I installed it, if it had problems the system would have already frozen or crashed.', 'Used with 960 EVO 500GB. my installation was a bit odd, as one of 3 fans would be, at least partially, a bit blocked by this card, so, I had the card mounted to a right ward PCI adapter, on the end slot. to keep it from blocking my GPUs fans. and a thermal pad ( a THICK one, due to the gap) to keep it cool. the card itself acts as my heat sink, as the SSD is on the opposite side of where the fan blows on. I had no bracket at all on it that normally bolts to the case. In games my peak temp is only around 35c so far. my case has a 200mm fan blowing directly over the PCI slots. Samsung magician rates read speeds as 3.3GB/s. It is obviously just som mass produced Taiwanese thing, sold at one time as Lycom on amazon, now ableconn. but i felt the design was more no-nonsense than the black cards with an LED on the back. Points for a volt meter to check it, a place to plug in an LED IF you want, and I can see the connections running through it, if i needed to cut it to make it fit. I did not, how ever. It is fitting into a Rosewill Thor V2 case just fine, as mounted.', 'I’ve installed hundreds of ssd’s into motherboard slots and add-on pcie cards, and this is the first card that scared me after installing the ssd. The ssd (2280) looked like a fishing pole with a 12 pound Muskie on the line. I tried 3 times and it looked the same each time. It worked when installed in the pc, but I can’t believe that it would last very long under stress like that. I tried different ssd’s just in case it was the drive, but it turned out the same. My client accepted it like that, and the price was right, but I personally would not accept it if it were my system.', ""Worked perfectly and easy to use.I have a Samsung PM951 256 GB M.2 PCIe SSD that came in a Dell XPS 15 (9550) laptop.  The XPS motherboard has failed and I have to send it back to Dell for service.  I wanted to back up my data off the SSD before sending back to them.  I ordered this (and a USB device from another vendor which didn't work at all) to do that.  The Ableconn card was easy to install in a desktop and my Win10 desktop recognized the drive without any problems.Some tips if your drive is encrypted:1) If you have Bitlocker encryption turned on on the SSD (like me) you will obviously need the recovery key/password to access the data.2) I did have the recovery key but it didn't work.  After much messing around it turned out this was because the desktop computer had an earlier build of Windows 10 than the laptop, and apparently drives encrypted with the newer Win10 build can't be decrypted by the older Win10.  Once I upgraded the desktop to the latest build (build 1607 as of this writing) I had no further problems."", '目的は達成できる。', ""To be honest, I was afraid to use this item. It is used to interface an M.2 NVMe SSD when your PC doesn't have the M.2 connector. Also, it seems that the connecting edge of the board closest to the bracket does NOT go into the connector - it is unattached! But I was simply afraid because the SSD is so expensive and if it failed and the SSD fried, I was out of some money. Nevertheless, everything seems to be working fine. The software that comes with the Samsung 960 PRO, Magician, indicates that the unit has a test transfer rate of 2.x GB/s!One thing to know: If you're placing this next to a 2-slot graphics card, it will fit, but may get hot. Also, the unit has 4 electrical/data lanes so it does not go into the slot closest to the CPU."", ""Does the job. I mounted a Samsung 950 Pro NVMe SSD on PC. After a bit of trial en error to make the disk visible to the BIOS (UEFI) it started working and achieved the advertised speed. So far no concerns, can't say if the card supports the full potential of the drive, comparison testing is needed. This item is 100% identical with Lycom DT-120 M.2 PCIe made by the same manufacturer in Taiwan. There is a small mechanical issue though. The small screw that should pinch the free end of the SSD drive (the semicircular indent) is too long. Not by a lot, but enough to keep this end rattling. If you force it down it may strip the thread, which may become a problem. I fixed it by grinding the end by 1/3-1/2 mm, using Dremel tool. Took a few minutes. Held the head strong with my finger nails and gently touched the end of the little bolt with the grind stone.

I then updated Acronis True Image software for the new Windows NVMe drivers, Booted to the Acronis bootable media, and was able to clone my OS to the new NVMe drive.  Will see if I can boot from this and will update accordingly and rate from 4 to 5 stars if so.

This is my first NVMe M.2 drive and the results are pretty amazing.  Would probably be better if I went up to a better CPU.  However, the real world performance is hardly noticeable from my previous cheapo Kingston SSD drive.  Sure the Crystal scores are 10x better, but I really don't notice it that much, if at all.  That was even from my old 2500k system compared to this new one.  The price was right so I'm not too upset about the purchase.  I just may think twice about getting one of these types of drives in the future since the real world performance just isn't there.

My original idea was to use a Samsung EVO 960 250GB as a boot drive, but when I couldn't find one decently priced I decided to start researching literally every m.2 NVMe drive I could possibly find that came close to the EVO in price and performance.  It actually proved to be a lot harder than expected since most m.2 drives were either SATA or only came in around 1500 MB/s at this price point.

The only negative I have currently found is that the drive itself does run a little on the warm side at roughly 67°C.

I have two 1TB units, as well as two 850 Evo 1TB SATA3 6Gbps drives. I do not play games, and use Windows 10 on both systems I have the 960 Evo NVMe and 850 Evo SATA3 drives installed in. I also purchase all my equipment outright; i build, tweak and own it. I also tried out a pair of OCZ RD400 units, and they underperformed for the money.I shoot/edit commercials in 1080P/2.5K RAW,  with Adobe CC and Blackmagic Resolve, so speed matters, but moreso in media/cache/export/previews, so the 960 Evo is simply set up for that purpose, and the SATA3 850 Evo are OS/Program disks. 30 minutes of footage can exceed 120GB of storage at 1080p, and i typically shoot 45-70 minutes of RAW 1080p, plus multiple audio sources to other gear, so it adds up quickly.With my previous x58 desktop, SSD, and ARECA RAID6, my highest disk speeds were 240MB r/230MB wr sustained on OCZ Vertex3 120GB, and 520MB r/440MB wr on an eight by 1TB 7200RPM disk-based ARECA ARC-1222 RAID6 setup.The 960 Evo, in both Z270 desktop and Z270 laptop, are an order of magnitude better, averaging 2.9GB r/1.6GB wr sustained performance.That, coupled with Thunderbolt 3, has saved me easily 2-5 hours of media transfer time per project day between SSD/SD camera/audio box cards/disks. In other words, I got a large chunk of my life back.I have a desktop I just built in my giant HAF 932 case with an Asus Rog Strix Z270e mobo, GeForce GTX 1080, i7 7700K at 5Ghz, H110i V2, 32GB 3400Mhz DDR4, 4K 60hz 27"" IPS display, Thunderbolt 3 PCIe card, 850w PSU, and a very nice 150 watt Klipsche 2.1 desktop audio setup on the HD audio side (broadcast is usually delivered in stereo), as well as a Sony receiver/JBL subwoofer totalling 1020 watts 7.1 setup on the optical side with a 50"" 4k UHD HDR television for client review/secret movie night with the GF (it\'s my company and my office dammit) with Displayport and Optical cable passing through a wall to receiver/HDR UHD TV.The 850 is my OS/Programs disk, and 960 EVO is media/cache/export/previews disk. Also an ARECA ARC-1222 eight disk RAID6 for mass storage totalling 5.3TB. I have excellent cooling in the HAF 932 case with a side intake fan blowing on the motherboard and hence on the 960 Evo as well to keep it cool, and a front intake fan to help cool the 850 Evo as well; in 2 weeks I\'ve seen no thermal throttling.This setup replaced an Asus Rampage III Gene x58, i7 980x 6-core at 4Ghz, 24GB 1600Mhz DDR3, GeForce GTX 660 2GB, OCZ Vertex3 120GB boot/OS with the same ARECA ARC-1222 eight disk RAID6 array which was also media/cache/export/previews.Laptop setup is approximately 268% faster than previous x58 desktop, new desktop is approximately 325% faster, due to faster processor/RAM. Data transfer speeds due to thunderbolt 3 to thunderbolt 3 is rediculous... Coming from average of 30Mbps to 1.5GBps is a world of difference.My x58 machine was not compatible with the NVMe 960 Evo, could not work with Thunderbolt 3, and even the SATA3 and USB3.0 it had were only marginally better than USB2.0 and SATAII speeds for data transfer, and sometimes worse. 24GB of RAM was adequate, and the i7 980x 6 core processor at 4Ghz was actually quite capable; I now use the i7 980x/Rampage III Gene and 24GB RAM, and Vertex 3 SSD as a home desktop/media center PC.I also have a brand new MSI GT73VR Titan Pro 4K 7RF i7 7820HK running at 4.3Ghz, GTX 1080, 4K G-Sync, 32GB 2400MHZ DDR4 RAM, Thunderbolt 3 laptop for mobile work, which replaced a very old Inspiron which was simply used to transfer media on site. I keep the laptop plugged in, and elevated about 2 inches from any table/surface with custom fan curves for clean, cool air intake, and added my own thermal pads to the 960 Evo and 850 Evo just in case, and I see no thermal throttling there as well.In the Titan Pro laptop, 850 Evo is OS/Programs, with 960 Evo set as media/cache/export/previews, same as the desktop, and now i can happily and easily edit on site/set, show clients raw footage vs quick edited preview, edit/batch RAW photos with presets from Photoshop I built on desktop/laptop after having calibrated the screens, work on it at home, and transfer the entire project via Thunderbolt 3 astoundingly fast when i get back to the office, and back to the laptop before i leave.Overall, the 960 Evo easily embarasses anything out there, including VERY pricey PCIe RAID setups with high end ARECA RAID controllers (borrowed an ARECA ARC-1880xi (?) With multidisk HDDs, then SSDs... disappointed.)If you have the capital and you use it for work or gaming, it\'s a no-brainer. These NVMe drives put SATA SSDs and HDDs firmly in the grave, and I won\'t bother buying anything else SATA related at this point; SATA is dead.Latency, spin up time, 3.5""/2.5""/1.8"" size disks, and slow sustained performance are a thing of the past.Sadly, for you gamers, per MSI Afterburner, these systems only produce 59.9FPS in solitaire at 4k resolution on 60hz G-Sync 4k displays and a Samsung 4k 60Hz gaming-capable low latency 8000 series tv, which I attribute to the weak GTX 1080 graphics cards in them. You may have better luck with less demanding games like Far Cry Primal, GTAV, or Hitman, which my interns  tell me stay locked at 60FPS on the same machines I just bought/built when they so generously stay after hours to \'quality test\' the equipment for me, but it\'s certainly not the 960 Evo\'s bogging them down ;)', 'Ich habe für mein neues System eine ausreichend große und schnelle SSD gesucht und bin bei der 960 EVO gelandet.Warum? Ich habe viel recherchiert und die Samsung EVO ist der beste Kompromiss für den durchscnittlichen Anwender.WICHTIG: Immer wieder liest man, dass die Platte viel zu langsam ist usw. Dazu gibt es 2 ganz wichtige Dinge zu bachten.1. Bei einigen Mainboards stehen, unter gewissen Bedingungen, für den M.2 PCIe Steckplatz nur eine begrenzte Anzahl an PCIe Lanes zur Verfügung und/oder nur eine ältere PCIe Version, in diesen Fällen kann die Leistung um 40-.60% abfallen!!! Achtet also vor dem Kauf wirklich darauf, dass euer Mainboard mit eurer Konfiguration auch PCIe 3.0 x4 (also 4 Lanes) für den M.2 Port zur Verfügung stellt. Warum schreibe ich ""imit eurer Konfiguration""? Weil es sein kann, dass durch Verwendung bestimmter Prozessoren und/oder anderen PCIe Steckkarten weniger Lanes zur Verfügung stehen. Bei meinem Board z.B. hat man mit einer APU der A6 Serie z.B. nur 2 Lanes!!!2. Diese SSDs werden RICHTIG heiß und um sich zu schützen drosseln die die Geschwindigkeit entsprechend. Wenn eure SSD also an einer schlecht belüfteten Stelle (bei mir auf der Rückseite des Mainboards) sitzt, dann müsst ihr dort ev. für zusätzliche Kühlung sorgen sonst kann es auch hier zu Leistungsverlust und ggf. sogar auch Beschädigung der SSD kommen.Nun zur SSD selbst:----------- Einbau -----------Die Installation läuft relativ einfach ab, wie abgebildet schräg von oben in den M.2 Slot (PCIe !!!) einstecken und mit der vom MAINBOARD HERSTELLER mitgelieferten Schraube fixieren > fertig.Im Normalfall, wenn man ein katuelles Board / BIOS verwendet, wird die Platte auch sofort erkannt.----------- Windows Installation -----------Für die neueste Windows 10 Build muss man eigentlich nur eines beachten, je nach dem ob man ein Board mit BIOS oder UEFI besitzt, läuft die Installation etwas anders ab, dazu am besten im Internet mal suchen. Wenn man wie ich auf einem UEFI Board von einem USB Stick installiert ist es recht einfach, zuerst den Bootmanager vom UEFI öffnen (bei mi F11 beim Start) und dort den USB Stick im ""UEFI Mode"" als Bootgerät wählen. Dann startet der Windows Assistent ganz normal und sollte die Platte anzeigen. Die Platte sollte nun gelöscht und formatiert werden, Windows sollte dann melden, dass weitere Partitionen erstellt werden müssen (das muss man bestätigen). Sollte dies Frage NICHT kommen habt ihr vermutlich eine 2. HDD mit einem bestehenden Windows System im System - In diesem Fall müsst ihr aufpassen denn Windowss geht dann von einem Multibootsystem aus, das ist nicht schlimm ABER der Bootmanager von Windows bleibt dann standardmäßig auf der ALTEN Platte und wenn ihr die später ausbauen wollt dann wird das System nicht mehr starten udn ihr müsst den Bootmanager manuell reparieren was nicht ganz einfach ist. In dem Fall im Internet die entsprechende Anleitung suchen ODER (noch einfacher) beim Installieren einfach die 2. Festplatte kurz abstecken!----------- Leistung -----------Nach der installation habe ich die Platte natürlich mit ChrystalDisk getestet und siehe da ... die SSD übertrifft sogar die angegebenen Werte, nicht massiv aber doch. Habe den Benchmark mehrmals gemacht, immer das gleiche Ergebnis.Im Stresstest habe ich dann die Temperatur gemessen und, wie zu erwarten, kratzen wir da schnell an der 70° Grenze, allerdings noch ohne Drosselung. Panik sollte man da noch nicht gleich bekommen, im normalen Betrieb erreicht die Platte diese Temperatruren bei weitem nicht so schnell und auch nicht dauerhaft. Am heißesten wird sie beim seq. read/write, wo auch die höchsten Transferraten erzielt werden aber genau dies Art von last ist im Alltag eher selten. Dennoch, Kühlung und gute Luftzitkulation können dieser Karte nur gut tun.----------- Fazit -----------Wenn man sich vorher gut informiert und alles beachtet was in Verbindung mit einer solchen SSD relevant ist, dann bekommt man hier eine exzelente M.2 PCIe SSD zu einem noch dazu mehr als fairen Preis im Vergleich. Genaugenommen gibt es keine SSD in dieser Klasse die zu einem wirklich niedrigeren Preis (nicht nur 2-3 Euro) die gleiche Leistung bringen würde. Und wenn es doch eine gibt, sieht man meist an den Bewertungen, dass die oft auch Probleme machen. Natürlich kann das auch hier passieren aber bei der Vielzahl an Bewertungen und dem üblicherweise gutem Support von Samsung, kann man hier deutlich beruhigter zugreifen.Von mir eine klare Kaufempfehleung WENN man vorher alles abgeklärt hat.', 'Because it is an older model I expected it to be tampered with (damaged or open box). But no, it was fresh and new. Great service.', 'Purchased at £109 with an eye to the future.Bought to fit underneath a new Asrock mITX AM4 motherboard (new build Ryzen 1600 cpu). Frankly I only bought because I didn\'t fancy added one later as this would mean yanking everything back out of the case and wanted the fun of giving the new technology a go. Also the price margin over the more standard SSD 2.5"" drive was only about 30 to 40%. So worth avoid the potential hassle, imo.The increase in speed is due to 4 PCI lanes being assigned to the NVMe drive compared to 1 PCI lane for standard SSD 2.5"" sized drives (these work essentally the same as mechanical drives with no physical delay). These four lanes can operate nearly simultaniously hence you would expect a minimum 4 times increase in sequential read speeds.The difference between the EVO and the PRO version is that the former only performs at top speeds for a limited time frame. In generall unless you\'re a professional worker dealing with huge files there is no worth in purchasing the PRO giving the price difference. Those doing more typical home user work, including AAA gaming, will almost certainly never notice the difference between EVO/PRO.Ok now the bad news. These drives run hot, much hotter than SSD and mechanical drives, especially when writing. You may need to consider this before purchasing (see later paragraph). The good news is that they have built in temperature sensors to throttle throughput in effectively the same manner as CPU/GPU throttle. So there is never any chance of burning the drive out. Performance depends on temperature albeit this will always be way above SSD 2.5"" levels.My drive was fitted in a \'worst-case\' location, underneath the motherboard with a 5 to 10mm gap to the metal shied compartment housing the the PSU, very low forced air flow likely. Temperatures, idle 30C riasing to 60-70C when under full load benchmarking. Saw little sign of throttling but suspect top temperature must be around 70C or so. Have concluded this is fine for gaming as there is little writing and unless I take up video editting can ignore.  There are heat spreaders available for these types of drives (rather costly imo), but consider them pointless if the key problem is lack of air flow. Samsung say the labelling is designed to act as a heat spreader, fine whatever.Anyway are they worth a 30 to 40% price premium over the SSD?Franking I am not too interested in benchmarks due to the dependence on temeperature and a general low opinion of there practical worth and prefer to go with \'feelings\'. So subjectively in use, by far the most noticable difference occurs on software installation especially if using Windows Updater 10, clearly a boon with a new build. Big difference on any task that leans heavily on \'writes\' to the drive. On \'reads\' little noticeable difference.So my answer to the above question would be: If it\'s a new build and you\'ve got a suitable NVMe M.2 slot, go for it, otherwise don\'t feel you\'re missing out on a lot. I wouldn\'t be inclined to purchase a PCIe slot expansion card to utilise a NVMe drive other than the fun of doing it.FWIW: My main concern on purchasing was whether I could directly install the OS on the drive without hassle. With Window Updater 10 (Build 1709) and the Asrock mITX Ryzen mobo (Bios 3.6) had no problems at all.Also looked/researched other brands of NVMe drive and considered it a no-contest to go for Samsung. The price margin just was not big enough although the other brands were will almost certainly be subjectively similar (except for Intel which I would avoid). Of course in time this will not be the case. Also note that very similar looking M.2 slot drives are SATA (and thus appear cheap) and not NVMe (VERY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE, see above), there performance is little better than SSD 2.5"" (and sometimes worst!).', ""Warning: Long Review. Context and experience with SSDsI recently purchased this device for my newest Alienware 17R4.

So I bought the Crucial 2TB SSD for the open SATA III port and it worked well enough, but some games were suffering severe lag, and I thought it may be the Crucial SSD, as it was a lot thinner and lighter than the Samsung 850 EVO 2.5inch SSD from the previous system. Turns out it was not the drive but the game itself which had been copied straight from the old system onto the new one, though the game had a severe outdoor lag that the game never had on the previous system. The old one has a 4thGen Core i7 2.80GHz overclocked to 3.2GHz, 16GB DDR3 RAM, 2GB Nvidia Geforce GTX 960m. But looking at the specs, the newer Crucial is just as fast as the SATA III 850 EVO, but cheaper, much lighter, smaller and twice the storage for less $$$ than the 850 EVO cost me  (it needs a caddy to fit into the drive space available)..In searching for a replacement drive, this system comes with a 2.5inch drive port (where the Crucial was installed) a boot drive slot for a PCI which currently has a crappy factory 128GB M.2 PCIe SSD which is small and slower by far, another such port where this 960 EVO is now installed, and there is still an open mSATA slot. I plan to replace the boot drive with another one of these same 960 EVOs which will bring my storage to 4TB, the largest I have ever had yet. With the mSATA I'm hoping it will be 5 or 6 TB later. I looked at the Samsung 850 EVO M.2 SATA III, but found it was the same speed as the first SSD on the previous system, though cheaper. It was still more expensive than the Crucial and only 1TB, so I looked into the 960 EVO/PROs, and was surprised how much faster the 960s were compared to the 850 EVO and Crucial SSDs (around 3X faster read/write speeds over both the 2.5inch SATA III and the M.2 SATA III). So I had the choice between the EVO and the PRO, and I saw that the PRO is several hundred dollars more expensive than the EVO for a mere 300MB/s of speed. The EVO is already 3x the speed of the Crucial, and the difference in performance was amazing. Moving 80GB of data used to take about a half hour on the SATA III 850 EVO and Crucial 2TB, now takes 10 minutes or less on the 960 EVO PCIe. This 960 EVO is actually less expensive than the 1TB 850 EVO SATA III I bought in 2015.TL;DR Amazing speed. Perfect for gaming. Buy the 1TB 960 EVO PCIe instead of the 1TB 960 PRO PCIe. The 300 or so MB/s of speed of the PRO is not worth the $120-$150 increased cost. Very happy with the amazing look and performance of my games."", 'Very fast, abysmal storage space (for gaming), not worth the price that i bought it at ($113).', 'Bueno, Bonito y Barato.Velocidad de lectura de 3219 MB/s y escritura de 1567 MB/s (FOTO 1)BUENO, (06 de Octubre del 2017):- Está entre los 1% de los SSD más rápidos del mundo (Percentil 99%) (FOTO 2)- Garantía de 3 años en el país en que se realizó la compra.- Es aproximadamente 5 veces más rápido que los SSD tradicionales SATA III- Es aproximadamente 25 veces más rápido que los Disco Duros mecánicos.- No hace ruído debido a que no tiene piezas mecánicas.BONITO, diseñado con la tecnología más avanzada:- Utiliza canales de PCIe que permiten velocidad 25 veces mayor que los canales SATA III- Diseño compacto que no necesita cables y prácticamente no ocupa espacio dentro del gabinete o en la laptop- Es prácticamente invisible debido que se mimetiza con los circuitos de la tarjeta madreBARATO, comparado con otros SSD con tecnología NVMe PCIe:- Está entre las opciones más baratas cuando buscas velocidad arriba del 2000 MB/s de lectura- - - - - - - - - -NEUTRAL:- Los SSD están compuestos por pequeñas celdas electrónicas que funcionan como una lámpara que tienen un tiempo de vida útil, y llega un momento en que éstas se desgastan debido al constante cambio eléctrico.

The Windows USB installation tool would not run for what I now know was several reasons.As someone who struggled with this as well in several stages, but appear to have siphoned the best practices from the interwebs as a couple of additions, it\'s all I can do to help others save their time. I plan on posting this on the 3 related items since I was unable to post on the blog that helped me along the way.Before we begin, 2 important items for those pulling their hair out or unsure if they can succeed with what they have available.Ensure you have updated your BIOS to the latest version. In my case, it was F22. It shipped with F7!Also, ensure your new SSD is the only storage device attached to the board.1. Obtain your .iso of windows 7 from MS\'s download page if you have not already.2. Format your flash drive as FAT32 and mount the iso image to the drive using the Windows USB/DVD Download Tool, also a MS download. The drive is now bootable but needs to be tweaked with the new USB drivers.3. Obtain the Windows USB Installation Tool from gigabyte or potentially other mfrs. Do NOT unzip it yet.4.**IMPORTANT** While the .zip file is still an un-extracted .zip file, right-click it, properties, and unblock it. This will prevent you from spending a long time unblocking individual files later.5. **IMPORTANT** Extract the .zip file to a very short directory name such as the root of a drive as many have suggested (thank you).6. Run the Windows USB Installation Tool and it will take 8-12 minutes if everything is going well. If any issues, run the tool as an administrator.7. After completion, add any other storage drivers to the flash drive you might need during installation, i.e. NVMe below. No particular path or steps, you can browse to them.8. Safely remove your flash drive and use it in one of the USB 2.0 ports at the top of your new board.9. Power on, F12 for boot menu, install windows 7, hopefully :) And be quite pleased you can use your OS you own outright and is still ""supported"".A note from step 7: google \'Howto Install Windows 7 on a Samsung SSD 960 Pro (M2)\' for assistance extracting the newest driver from the Samsung executable (that requires the drive to already be installed to run). I did not attempt installation using the NVMe driver that was included in the Windows USB Installation Tool, as it was an earlier version and I was not certain of 960 evo compatibility. Once the files were extracted to c:/program files/samsung, I just added them to the flash drive and pointed to them during windows installation.BTW this chip is screaming fast. :)', '1TB version.

Now 1.72 GBs read and 1.51 GBs write speed. This is probably the maximum speed that PCIe 2.0 will ever reach. The RX470 performs the same at x8 as it did at x16 so adding the x4 expansion card in the second x16 (x8 with both x16 used) did not affect the video speed.

It is attached to a PCIe 2.0 x4 M.2 socket that is connected to a 950 southbridge so it is limited to about 75% of the a3 link (max 2.0 GBs) due to all the other devices being attached to the SB (14 usb 2.0, 6 SATA3, GB network, PCI etc.). So I expected a maximum read speed maximum of about 1.5 GBs.Another person with the same motherboard posted a much lower score and that is probably due to their PC being configured improperly. My case is just about maxed out with 2 SSD, 4 HDD, PCIe hdd/usb3 controller for the DVD, Samsung 960 M.2, and RX470. MB and Video are overclocked for new games 5GHZ+ and 15%, older games 4.9GHZ and 5%. Older games have problems when the CPU is over 4.9 GHZ or video over 9.5%. New games run just fine at 5 GHZ and 15%.Samsung's program shows 1.4 GBs read and 1.3 GBs write with IOPS 115k and 101K.Crystalmark shows a similar benchmark 1.4 GBs read and 1.3 GBs write.Only way to get it to function faster is with a PICe add-in card so that it would be attached to the nothbridge. It would probably function at 90%+ of the pcie 2.0 x4 capacity of 2GBs. There is no way to get PCIe 3.0 speed of 4GBs (3.2 actual) from a PCIe 2.0 connection. An impractical solution to getting a faster data transfer rate would be to purchase a PCIe 2.0 x8 raid controller and attach 8 0.5GBs SSDs running in a Stripe 0 configuration (is that possible?).I am very satisfied with the 1.3GBs speed of the Samsung 960.PC:ASUS 970 Pro Gaming/Aura ATX DDR3 AM3+FX-8370ARCTIC Liquid Freezer 240Enermax Ostrog ADV Mid Tower Computer Case with Revolution DUO 700W 80 PLUS GOLD Power Supply inside (Limited Edition), ECA3380AS-BL(w/PSU)ASUS PCE-AC55BT B1 Wireless-AC1200 Bluetooth 4.2 PCIe/mPCIe adapterADATA XPG V1 DDR3 2133MHz (PC3 17000) 16GB (8GBx2) Memory Modules, Red (AX3U2133W8G10-DR)PowerColor AMD Radeon RED DEVIL RX 480 4GB GDDR5 DL-DVI-D / HDMI / DP x3 PCI-Express 3.0 Graphics CardSamsung 960 EVO Series - 250GB PCIe NVMe - M.2 Internal SSD (MZ-V6E250BW)Transcend 4-port PCI Express USB/Serial ATA Combo Adapter""]"

I needed a larger drive to store my games on.  Out of the box, I formatted the drive to exFAT indicates about 1.86tb (1908GB) of usable space.  I used the crystal disk mark to test performance and the numbers were comparable or better than my crucial drive. I proceeded to clone the crucial over to the micron.  Once everything was cloned over I ran another test and the write performance started to underperform.  I checked the drive format and it was now formatted as NTFS which was the format my crucial had. I ran tests on the crucial 512SSD and it had no issues, the read/write speeds were fine.  I decided to format the micron as NTFS with nothing on the drive and ran the tests again, the write performance underperformed again.  Formatted the micron a 3rd time to exFat and ran the test once more and the write performance was much better as exFAT format.  Decided to copy over the data instead of attempting to clone. Tested the micron again and the numbers excelled once more.  It seems like that this SSD doesn't perform well when formatted to NTFS.  For the price per GB and overall it does perform well when formatted as exFat I am overall happy with the purchase and is a good bang for the buck.Note:  My experience with the drive has been a day so far.

I ran several tests with both file formats, and found them to be comparable. 4k 1QD reads test between 20-25MB/s, which while not mind blowing, is more than acceptable. Sustained writes, sequential read/rights, latency, and general usage have all been great for a drive at this price point."", ""Purchased this SDD to replace the stock 5400 RPM HDD in my Xbox One X. It's a shame the stock drive is a bottleneck on such a powerful system. Replacing the hard drive is kind of a pain, but knocked it out in an evening (SOOO much easier on PS4). But the drive runs great! The system boots faster, and games load noticeably quicker. Not to mention an upgrade in size, which is pretty great. And finding a 2TB SSD at $300 is a steal. Any other brand is ~$200 more. Overall, couldn't be happier."", ""I installed two of these into a Synology DS218j NAS ( https://www.amazon.com/Synology-bay-DiskStation-DS218j-Diskless/dp/B076G6YKWZ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1526487233&sr=8-2&keywords=synology+ds218j ) and setup as a RAID mirrored config.

I can't tell you how many of these are fake reviewers, but what I am going to do is sell you this drive and Micron can recruit me later.First of all, you cannot beat this price. I don't care what kind of sale is running or what store is closing down, the price to performance ratio is absurd. $300 is the price for a 1TB SSD, and a mid-range 2TB will run you about $550.Second, I'll tell you now, this thing is no Samsung 960 Pro. Don't put it in a speed race and drop your paycheck on it, because you'll be out a paycheck. That being said, it's a solid, consistent riding horse. It'll get your data from A to B at five or six times the speed of an HDD (or at about 30x, I'll get to that in a second) without missing a beat. See my attached pictures for details.Third, don't let the brand Micron scare you. It's not some knockoff Chinese brand held together by Elmer's Glue and plastic clips. Micron is the company that owns Crucial, so you can expect the same or even better quality. Metal case, came with no dents or dings. It's not pretty and it doesn't have RGB functionality, but it's not an eyesore either.Fourth, listen closely, this one is important if you want a jet powered mechanical hoverpony instead of a riding horse. There is a program that you should download as soon as you pop this bad boy in your case called Crucial Storage Executive (and yes, this application will work perfectly with the SSD, see point three). It will show you the health of all your drives, as well as some special options for Crucial/Micron drives you can check out yourself. But the important one is called Momentum Cache in the tabs on the left. If you have less than 16GB of RAM, I would recommend that you stop reading here as this feature is not really for you. If you have 16GB or more, enable Momentum Cache. It uses your RAM to cache data and then writes from the RAM in periods of low disk usage. It will take up 25% of your RAM, but never more than 4GB at a time. It will never cause you to max out your RAM, it will automatically reduce its usage if other application(s) go above 75% to accommodate your needs. Talk about a smart program! The downside to this is, if you don't have an UPS (uninterruptible power supply) for your computer and were to experience a power outage, the data that was stored in RAM at the time will be lost. So use it at your own discretion! Using Momentum Cache will result in read/write speeds about 20x faster than a mid-to-high-range HDD.So, that's my spill. I am confident you will make the right decision!"", 'TLTR if you are using this drive only on a mac, terrific drive, if you are using it on windows, dont buy, read belowAs a mac ssd, it is awsome, it detects 2.05TB, writting speed is ok, could be better, but I dont complaint.If I were going to use this drive on a mac, it could have 5stars, only presentation dropping one star as the drive is somewhat not sturdy as samsungs.But in windows 10, WOW, how come so many things could go wrong with this drive.First off, I assume all issues are software related and a update on the drivers could solve all problems, but, man, so many to list.First, I bougth this drive to free space on a Dell XPS9760 (windows 10) and a macbook pro (2015). I started on the mbp, mac detected the drive, just not formatted, I formatted on NTFS with Paragon NTFS for mac, after that, 2.05TB pum, copied about 200 GB off my mbp, another 1TB on a pair of 512GB ssds I had around, bum, pam, everything OK on my mac, unmounted it, so lets go to windows.BTW Here comes my nightmares with this drive.On windows 10 it was just a total disaster. Windows didnt recognize this drive, but it appeared on Device Manager and  Disk Management. but hey, wait, there were 4 different partitions on Disk Management. Jumped back to mac, just a partition and was formatted and with all the files, back to windows...4 partitions, neither could load on windows. Tried downloading drivers, Windows Update, nope, Crucial page (Crucial is the parental company of Micron I guess) nada. I thoght, could it be I had to format the drive first on windows... umm, ok, I had to recopy back all the files I had previously copied (1.3TB or so), done. Tried formatting it on windows, I deleted all four partitions, just two of them could be deleted and they merged with other one, now I have two partitions, the first one could be formatted, but no the second one. nope, back to mac.On mac, the drive couldnt load as I deleted two of the partitions. I tried formatting using Disk Utility (I change a default option for another one I dont remember right now), bum again, 2.05TB NTFS, bam. Jumped back to windows, and...oh oh...I dont know why, but macOs (Catalina as of writting this) marks a whooping 2.05TB...in windows, could sound like a joke, windows only detects 1.9TB. Maybe 1.9 is closer to 2.05, but we are talking to a whooping 105gbs missing.I dont know what will happen when the drive gets full as windows only recognizes 1.9gb, but this drive is missing the first pupporse I bought it, copying files between windows and mac.The worst thing is I dont know if its the drive or windows, but my mac is formatting this drive in NTFS, a windows format, way much better than windows, no errors, in windows, lots of errors. You have to live to see some things!I am not getting speeds, ssds are fast, I wont think if all these happen to me on a regular HDD.', 'I have to update my review to point out that microns software support of this drive is very poor.  Newer versions of storage exec and crucials utility do not recognize this drive in Windows 10 and it\'s been that way for quite some time. You lose firmware update and momentum cache due to this problem. Drive works fine without it but I would no longer recommend due to this software issue-----------------------------Seems like a great bargain to me. A large 2TB SSD from a reputable company at a rock bottom price. You receive just the drive itself and nothing else. No fancy packaging to be found. The drive came with current firmware. I wanted to make my gaming PC an all SSD build but the cost for a large 2TB SSD that has good specs always made it prohibitive until this drive. My OS and applications are on a Samsung NVME M.2 SSD and my steam game library is on this Micron SSD. I\'m hearing that this drive is the OEM version of the Crucial MX300 SSD which isn\'t a bad drive even today.I benchmarked this Micron 1100 SSD and things are looking good (see attached Crystal Disk Mark pic) . This SSD was recently featured in a video by tech YouTuber ""Tech Deals"" and he said it was a good drive for the price. It isn\'t the fastest SSD out there but it is still a good performer and way better than even the best spinning disk hard drives.You can download the management software from Microns website  I haven\'t been able to fully explore the softwares features but it\'s looking like it is pretty useful and even has a RAM caching feature called ""Momentum Cache"". I included a screenshot of benchmarking done after enabling Momentum Cache.So far I would definitely recommend this drive as long as it stays at its current price or better. In my opinion it would make a great Steam drive or even an OS drive if you only have one drive bay. I\'ll update my review if anything changes. Thanks', 'This drive is a great upgrade for the PS4 Pro which has the power and connections to take advantage of an SSD. It\'s currently the cheapest available 2tb SSD option out there. After upgrading, your storage will be 1.82tb. While very pricey compared to the\xa0\nSeagate 2TB FireCuda SSHD\n\xa0which is the most popular 2tb PS4 hard drive, it can always be repurposed if you get rid of your PS4.Upgrading the drive took me about 30 minutes. It could not have been much easier. You will need 2 SD cards or USB drives. I did not need to deactivate my PS4 or anything like that.1)Go to the official ""playstation ps4 upgrade hard drive"" website to get directions. It tells you how to save all your game saves.2)Go to the official ""playstation system software update"" website. Scroll all the way down to find directions for ""Perform a new installation of system software"". You will need to download a file that is about 900mb. If it is only half that, you have the wrong file.3)That\'s it as far as the SSD installation. Now you just need to download all your games again and input all the users.Will you notice a vast improvement in loading times? Unlikely. I did not notice a significant difference. You might shave a few seconds off here and there but loading still takes some time. It may be worth the cost over a standard SSHD if you want to squeeze out every bit of performance, are concerned about durability or noise of spinning disks, or can reuse it in a computer or PS5 someday.', ""I own three Samsung SSD 850 top tier drives so I have accurate measurements of Samsung's read and write speeds using DiskMark64. I performed the DiskMark64 speed test on this drive- Micron 1100, 2 terabyte model- several times throughout the day. The Samsung EVO vs Micron difference is a negligible 3-5% faster in 7 of the 8 DiskMark speed tests for Samsung. In only one of the eight tests, my Samsung EVOs are clearly faster during the 4k Q1T1 speed test (the left bottom graph in DiskMark). Samsung is 36 megabytes/second vs 28.5 megabytes/second for Micron in the 4k Q1T1 test. However, among all of the tests in DiskMark, the Q1T1 test is mostly artificial since rarely does an SSD access only ONE (queue depth of 1 per thread) random 4k cluster frequently in normal use. More usually, SSDs process MANY requests such as during Windows boot where many programs are loading simultaneously where the SSD performance matters the most in saving real-world time, not just a theoretical benchmark. Overall, the Samsung 850 EVO real-world large file copy speed is about 8% faster than Micron. Highly recommend this drive especially the 2tb, where competitors with SSDs of similar performance, can't touch the Micron 1100 price by hundreds. Micron is a subsidiary of Crucial and Crucial's SSDs are well respected. This Micron 1100 SSD is not a cheap no-name bottom tier performer."", 'This review is of a Micron 1100 2TB SSD. I chose a 1 STAR rating not because I hate it, but because it isn\'t what I purchased. This was not as advertised. The data sheet for the Micro 1100 says it is 530 MB/s Reads and 500 MB/s Writes. It is not.My testing/benchmarking was with an 2017 5K 27"" iMac 4.2GHz Intel i7 QuadCore running macOS 10.12.6 Sierra in one scenario and Windows 10 Pro under BootCamp in another. I tested using AJA System Test Lite and BlackMagicDesign\'s Disk Speed Test 3.1 on macOS 10.12.6 Sierra; and with CrystalDiskMark on Windows.I also recently benchmarked a Crucial MX500 500GB SSD.The MX500 was about 415 MB/s for both reads and writes give or take a few megabytes per second, while the Micron was 415 MB/s on Writes and only 315 MB/s on Reads. I was taken aback at this. The MX500 data sheet has it at 560 MB/s Reads and 510 MB/s for Writes. The Micron data sheet has it at 530 MB/s on Reads and 500 MB/s on writes, but it was a full 100MB/s slower on reads than writes. I contacted Micron tech support and we verified the setup and the firmware. Their conclusion was that something is wrong with the drive.I might add that the enclosures used were USB 3.0 with UASP and I verified the UASP using the OS. The cables were the same and the ports used on the iMac were the same and the enclosure was the same. There was no hub in between the system and the enclosure.The test was done with a USB 3.0 with UASP active external drive and Not a SATA connection inside the computer, so that was the one thing I couldn\'t test.I will say that if you are OK with losing the 100MB/s of read speed it is a good deal as far as cost per GB goes at this time, but I am looking at SSDs and USB 3.0 with UASP for higher speeds, so the loss of 100 MB/s is a deal breaker for me.The Amazon people were great helping me with the return. I would really like to give them a 5 STAR just for the return, but the drive read speed is the focus of this review and I want to make cwertain others like me know about my experience.', 'Used this SSD to replace failed HD component of fusion drive in a 2013 27"" iMac. Used a 2.5 adapter to fit properly. The speed increase in incredible. Boot time is a fraction of previous setup. An additional benefit, never hear the fans going, and we are in the midst of a heat wave. I use the iMac for Logic Pro X and Final Cut Pro, as well as some 3D apps. So, the computer gets stressed....still running cool enough that no fans. Everything runs faster.Micron is a long established brand, thus low concern about suspect internals.I can easily recommend this item, for anyone seeking to replace a standard HD with a SSD. And, especially to anyone looking to replace/upgrade HD in an iMac.', ""I'm sure my grandkids will make fun of me for such a headline, but they need to know our struggles. We want NVME speeds at SATA SSD prices.The clever elves at Crucial Tech came up with a way to use unused RAM on PCs with more than 16gb to assist with r/w. Called 'momentum cache' (google it) this has taken what would've been a respectable 400ish mb/s into 8x that speed.Granted that it won't last as long as a Samsung EVO PRO. But I'm not paying Samsung EVO pro money either. It needs to behave for the next 5 years and that's all I need and with Crucial's warranty we're good. God knows we'll be saving data on air molecules or bread crumbs by then so yeah I'm ok until 2023.FYI I have it installed into my PC for momentum caching to work.

I was really hoping to find a great deal on the Samsun 850 EVO like I found last year, but had no such luck. Then I stumbled across this drive. I remembered the name Micron from when I was a kid and my folks bought their first home computer, a Micron. 2TB for under $500 sounded almost too good to be true, so I did some research. I found that Micron makes the 3D NAND modules used in Crucial SSDs, as well as some other brands. Not only that, they offer a... wait for it.... 5 YEAR WARRANTY on these drives. I ordered a pair of them to put into RAID 0 for installed games in my recently built gaming rig. The perform amazingly, and passed all diagnostic tests I ran before calling it good. In RAID 0, they are incredibly fast. I'm sure a single drive would be slower than a comparable Samsung 850 EVO, but costs over $200 less. I attached a screenshot from Crystal Disk Mark showing the performance of the RAID array."", ""Buys like this are why I love Amazon.For not much more than than you'd pay for a traditional spinning hard disk of this capacity in a big box store, you instead get a 2TB SSD shipped to your door quickly. No annoying packaging to try and slice through (or documentation that you don't care about anyway). Just a drive.Connected and formatted within 10 minutes. No hiccups, no hassles, plug and play. Thin and light enough to fit in pretty much any case configuration.1.4TB of data copied to it by the end of the day. Basically my entire Lightroom archive and all catalog files, which now SCREAM. Scrolling through 200k photos is like scrolling over a web page in Chrome. No more lags. Totally different experience that's going to save me a ton of time.Loving it, entirely, and love the price.

It holds data (woo!), it's fast, it's not insanely hot or power hungry when running at full capacity, and it has a nice warranty.The reason I gave this three stars is due to the issues with the write cache. If you're writing a ton of data to this drive that fills the cache faster than it can write it (say copying 200 gigs of stuff from your old drive to this one), you run into some major issues with the drive that shows it's faults. The controller doesn't know what do with with this extra data trying to be written into the cache while it's full so it seems to just slow down until it can get some of that cache written off. How slow does it get down to? Well, about 4kb/s to 1mb/s. REALLY slow. After it's offloaded some of that data it'll speed up for a few moments, then slow down again. This makes this drive non-desirable for anyone moving big data to a drive.

Some reasons prove to be very practical and others did not windup working out.1.Larger size of the drive - worked.2. Crucial Tech Support - left a great impression.3. Company & Warranty -  very good.4. Software Bundle - glitchy and frustrating with my setup.Size of Drive Larger than CompetitorsThe first reason I bought the 275 gigabyte SSD Drive is because the data and software on my original SATA drive was 224 gigabytes period I was concerned that a 240 gigabyte drive would not hold my software or data.Crucial Tech SupportWhen I called Crucial to find about if the drive was compatible with my computer. I talked to some very good tech support people who impressed me with their knowledge of the computer I had and what I was trying to do. Amrican tech support people who are kind, helpful and extemely knowledgeable scored high on my list. It is very important when you buy an SSD drive that you have someplace you can call for technical support which they will help you. Crucial also has some very good videos.I also choose to buy The crucial drive because when I talked to the tech person he stated that Crucial is one of the few companies that make their own drives and their own and Flash NAND. The drive comes with 3 year warranty. These were all good buying choices.SoftwareThe next reason I purchased this drive is because it comes with the software from Acronis True Image HD 2105 software.. Most people buy the software after they buy the SSD drive. I figured it saved me some money.The tech also told me that when push comes to shove if I did not have electrical power for the new SSD drive I could take it off of the DVD drive already in the computer to enable the drive to work.The only place I ran into glitches was with the Acronis True Image HD 2015 software. The Crucial SSD Drive comes with an OEMversion of the software which means that only some features of the software are enabled.Basically the True Image HD 2015 Software did not boot as it was supposed to do after finding the Crucial Drive. I couldn't the software it to boot. I could generate an zip file error message but that’s all.  I couldn't get the bootable drive to boot, then I became very frustrated there isn’t Acronis support for the for True Image HD 2015 software there is only Crucial support and I installed the drive on a weekend.The screen froze and the software was not doing what it was supposed to do which was to reboot to copy the drive. It was freezing in the middle of the drive not initializing the Crucial Drive. The support information from Crucial was not really clear what to do it said make a bootable Drive I tried that it did not work.Finally, I borrowed a full version of Acronis True Image from my neighbor who gave me up the bootable CD / DVD disc and then I was able to copy the information from the original drive to the SSD drive.I plan on buying a full version of a Acronis True Image to copy my drive in the future because I spent quite some time trying to get the OEM version to work which lacked certain functionality. It's not really clear whether the software was unable to copy the device correctly and but after about five hours I just gave up.I think the OEM software that comes with the drive is good enough for most people however it did not work for me.I realize that the Crucial SSD drive is not the cheapest but it is working now at the speed of light. I am very happy with the drive I wish the 500-gigabyte drive was less expensive.The tech support guy also told me that I didn't have to worry about an buying a 3/12” drive adapter kit that I could just use foam double stick tape to hold in the drive because it was a solid state drive. That saved me the price of the adapter kit which I am grateful for.I have had several people tell me that the SSD drive speeds up Windows functionality and they were right. Things that were cranking and taking forever now take very few seconds.The entire procedure for installing the drive took a several more hours because of the software not working, Therefore, I suggest if you really want to do the whole change over quickly to invest in buying the full version of the Acronis Image Software.Another thing  that did not work out properly which I thought would is that I ordered the Crucial Drive from Amazon directly as opposed to ordering it from Crucial.  I thought that ordering it from Crucial would take longer because they are in Idaho and I needed the drive delivered to California. However, it took a almost took 8 - 10 business days before Amazon shipped this SSD Drive. Once it was shipped it was delivered the next day. It leads me to believe that Amazon when it gets an order,contacts Crucial, who then  sends the drive to Amazon and then they send it to the customer. Now that I see how fast Windows is running on the SSD drive I wish I bought an SSD drive soonerI rate crucial the drive itself very highly. They are they are aware that if you don't have the right software to install the drive then people will return the drive.  I realize that they are not in control of whatever made it impossible for their OEM software to work. The technical support directly from Acronis does not work for the OEM version. The support documentation for the software from Crucial was not that great.Fortunately, for me I have a neighbor who is a software engineer and brilliant. He told me at one point “Google” the solution but the solution was having a good smart tech person to be your neighbor.I highly recommend the crucial SSD drive to users. I only wish they would bring the price down which I would suspect would be happening in a few years"", 'Rapporto qualità prezzo sicuramente il suo punto di forza oltre che ha delle ottime prestazione e durabilità ottimo, lo uso a distanza di anni e non mi ha mai dato alcun problema , i prodotti crucial sono una garanzia e la mia prima scelta .', ""Ho montato il SDD su un portatile Toshiba Satellite Pro, le prestazioni sono stupefacenti, ero ormai abituato ad usare la sospensione invece dello spegnimento per risparmiare diversi minuti sull'avvio, ora son tornato a spegnere tranquillamente e riaccendere il PC, senza problemi, in quanto in meno di due minuti sto già lavorandoci... tutto scorre più fluido, ha anche meno problemi di surriscaldamento e meno impiantamenti, perfino meno errori di sitema dovuti al fatto che appunto abusavo della sospensione perché ci voleva una decina di minuti con il suo HDD originale al sistema per mettermi in condizione di lavorare (beh, sì, non è un windows nudo e puro che carico, mi serve un sacco di roba...).Le prestazioni verificate con i benchmark sono pietrificanti, questo è il mio secondo sdd, uso un trascend su un pc fisso ma come secondario e poi quel pc è solo sata2, quindi l'incremento di prestazioni ottenuto su quel PC è sostanzioso, ma ... umano; sul portatile invece, supporto sata3, il solo passare dal HDD 5400 giri originale a questo SDD  della crucial, ha cambiato il modo di affrontare le giornate lavorative, davvero strabiliante. Considerando poi il prezzo di 130 €, è un affare! O sarebbe un affare, se.... insomma, do 4 stelle e non 5 per due piccoli particolariche il produttore avrebbe potuto migliorare con pochi centesimi di spesa:1) nella confezione non ci sono le viti. Io dovevo fare una sostituzione ed ho recuperato le viti dall'HDD mandato in pensione, ma se dovete montarlo come aggiunta, procuratevi le viti. Eppure solitamente, anche produttori più terra terra le 4 vitarelle le includono nella confezione.... Ah, notare che c'è una cornicetta di plastica da usare come spessore se si vuole montare il SDD in un vano alto 9mm (è il caso del mio portatile) mentre senza la cornicetta calza perfetto in vani da 7 mm. Comunque l'assenza delle 4 viti è una disattenzione non grave nei confronti del cliente, non è stato quello a bruciare la quinta stella.2) il software in dotazione: ebbene, la quinta stella si è bruciata lì. Paradossalmente se non ci fosse in bundle la licenza per acronis, avrei messo 5 stelle. Vi sconsiglio di usarlo, almeno nella versione fornita, che è vecchia e problematica; aggiornarlo costa altre 30 euro, sconsigliate sia perché non so se l'aggiornamento risolve i problemi sia perché a quel punto tanto ma tanto meglio scaricarsi autonomamente un programma per fare la copia del disco, anche uno gratuito tipo clonezilla; se vi ricordate di impostare manualmente in fase di partizionamento (prima della copia vera e propria) di allineare per SDD le partizioni (importante se il disco originale era stato creato su XP e poi magari avete anche riformattato e messo Seven o 10 o quello che volete, ma se la partizione iniziale era creata da XP, non va bene per gli SDD e se clonate il disco senza gestire questo particolare, le prestazioni saranno ridotte di oltre la metà in termini di velocità e il disco vivrà metà del tempo previsto (già, ricordiamoci sempre che gli SDD muoiono per loro natura, non hanno la longevità di un disco meccanico, a patto che il disco meccanico non si rompa per qualche motivo fisico ovviamente). Il software Acronis, questo particolare lo gestirebbe anche automaticamente e sarebbe anche facile da usare, ma come avrete letto in molte recensioni, spesso crea disastri, danneggia le copie, si rifiuta di eseguire e sopratutto bisogna poi disinstallarlo perché spesso (successo anche a me) è la causa di malfunzionamenti e blocchi del PC dopo che ha finito di copiare. Anzi, alcuni utenti hanno interpretato come disco difettato o incompatibile col loro PC il malfunzionamento dovuto in realtà solo ad Acronis. Nel mio caso sono stato frtunato: dopo 6 ore di copia dal HDD originale a questo SDD, Acronis, al 99% del lavoro, si è bloccato segnalando errori erichiedendo operazioni che al tempo stesso impediva di fare, ha reso instabile il PC che stavo usando per la copia e dopo varie arrabbiature, dopo aver scaricato altri software per verificare le integrità del disco originale e usabilità della copia, dopo essermi rassegnato al fatto che avevo distrutto il Crucial per colpa di Acronis, montando l'SDD nel portatile ed avviandolo così per curiosità e per sperimentare alternative tipo partizionare, formattare, installare e copiare tutto a mano (incubo che richiederebbe giorni e giorni) scopro che in realtà la copia era completa e perfetta e il mio sistema (seven Pro con tutti i miei software e lavori) era del tutto integra e le prestazioni del SDD davvero fantastiche... altro che danneggiato. In buona sostanza, tutte le segnalazioni fornite da Acronis si sono rivelate sbagliate, Acronis stesso impediva il riconoscimento della copia fatta e sempre Acronis rendeva instabile il sistema operativo sul disco originale!Quindi:comprate tranquillamente il disco, ma anche le 4 vitarelle e la cavetteria, che nel pacco che arriva c'è solo il disco, lo spessorino di plastica e il foglietto con le istruzioni per scaricare e attivare Acronis. Ecco, quel fogliettino strappatelo e se dovete fare la clonazione di un disco come solitamente avviene acquistandone uno nuovo, beh, scaricatevi un qualsiasi software serio, ce ne sono di gratuiti che funzionano. Certo se Crucial avesse fornito un software di clonazione ai livelli di quello che regala samsung con i suoi SDD, di stelle ne avrebbe meritate davvero 5 perché il disco in sé è molto valido ed ha un prezzo giusto."", 'Ottima velocità in scrittura e lettura, duraturo e affidabile. Consiglio l’acquisto', 'Buon prodotto. Prestazioni come da aspettative.', 'No issues for replacement to my old MacBook but I did have to goto Apple Genius centre for them to format.', 'Adquirí esta unidad SSD Crucial MX300 interna de 525 GB (bueno, seamos precisos: en realidad una vez formateado y preparado son 487 GB, es decir, 523.821.322.240 bytes) para poner al día mi ordenador portátil HP Probook 4740s, cuyo disco duro mecánico de 488.3 GB útiles no era especialmente rápido. Hacía pocos días también le había instalado un módulo RAM de 8 GB de Crucial (de fábrica traía 4 GB) que instalé en unos minutos sin problema alguno, así que la marca me daba cierta confianza y el precio está muy bien. No debía ser un proceso complicado pues los HP Probook están preparados para ser actualizados fácilmente.El disco SSD llegó como es habitual en el debido tiempo y forma, así que me puse manos a la obra: tras poner en orden y limpiar de morralla el disco a clonar me dispuse a hacerlo con el software ""Acronis True Image"" que facilita el fabricante y siguiendo las indicaciones de su web. CRASO ERROR: EL SOFTWARE DE ADMINISTRACIÓN Y CLONADO DE DISCOS DUROS DE ACRONIS ES UNA ABSOLUTA BASURA, por lo menos en lo que a los HP Probook se refiere. Simplemente, NO FUNCIONA, el proceso falla cuando trata de reiniciar el ordenador para lanzar la aplicación de clonado.Cabreado, tuve que brujulear por la red para ver qué podía hacer. La solución la encontré en el conocido software ""EaseUS Partition Master"", que  tiene una versión gratuita, aunque la de pago es la que realmente merece la pena y permite hacer todo el proceso con comodidad. Resumo los pasos a dar para los interesados:1) Conectar el SSD al USB del ordenador con un cable USB a SATA para discos de 2.5"" y arrancar el software ""EaseUS Partition Master"".2) Convertir, en caso de ser necesario, la tabla de particiones del SSD de MBR a GPT. Los dos discos tienen que tener el mismo formato de particiones.3) Ahora ya podemos clonar el viejo disco mecánico HHD en el nuevo SSD pero ¡atención! Además de clonar el contenido hay que clonar la estructura de las particiones de arranque, es decir hay que hacer que el SSD sea un ""boot drive"". Para eso lo más fácil y rápido es usar el asistente para migrar el SO (sistema operativo) al SSD/HHD. Una vez dada la instrucción, el ordenador se reinicia, se lanza la aplicación de clonado de forma automática y solo queda esperar una hora o así (para un disco de 500 GB).4) Una vez finalizado el clonado, solo queda apagar el ordenador, abrir la tapa inferior, retirar el viejo HHD y en su misma carcasa poner el SSD (no hace falta adaptador alguno en este modelo), conectarlo al terminal SATA (un SATA II en este caso), cerrar, poner en su sitio la batería y arrancar el ordenador. NO es necesario tocar nada en la BIOS.5) ¡¡Listo!! El ordenador funciona a la perfección, arranca más rápido y se nota el aumento de la velocidad en el acceso a las aplicaciones. Todo va más fluido, se gasta algo menos de batería y encima he ganado 40 GB de espacio adicional.Y esto es todo; de momento estoy muy satisfecho. A ver qué tal va todo con el uso y el tiempo.', 'The drive itself is highly reliable, and the improvement in performance since I upgraded from my old 1TB Hard Disk Drive (HDD) is stunning.  I also got a fantastic deal by picking up the 525GB model for just £82.  For an Solid State Drive (SSD) of this quality and capacity, that is incredible.  There are countless articles and reviews extolling the virtues of SSDs over HDDs, so I won\'t repeat those again here.  Instead I\'ll explain the reason I didn\'t give the product the full five stars.My short advice is, don\'t follow the drive\'s own installation instructions if you are cloning and replacing an old HDD.  Do not use the Acronis software that is advised.  Instead, download a free version of Macrium Reflect.  It will save a huge amount of time and effort.  For the technical information and the reasoning for my recommendation, read on if you don\'t mind a short essay!I recently also purchased a Samsung SSD, and the installation was so simple it blew me away.  I plugged the new SSD into my computer with a SATA/USB adapter, installed the bundled Samsung software, and in less than 20 minutes my entire hard drive had been cloned onto the new SSD.  I then simply opened the case up, swapped the two drives around, and the job was done.  Installing this Crucial MX300 was nowhere near as effortless.  Rather than create their own software, Crucial include within the box a product key for Acronis True Image software, that can be downloaded from the Crucial website.  There are no installation instructions in the box other than to download this software and follow the ""on-screen instructions"".  So I connected my new Crucial SSD via USB, loaded the software, selected the drive I wanted to clone, and my new SSD as the target drive.  Then nothing happened.  I tried a few more times without success, so I went online and spent ten minutes searching for answers.  Eventually I found an explanation that in order to clone a laptop drive with Acronis, you have to physically swap the drives BEFORE the cloning, attaching the old drive externally instead.  The problem with this is that Windows will not boot your laptop from a drive attached via USB.  So you can\'t actually start Windows in order to use the software.  Therefore the only way to complete the process with Acronis is to do the following:1) Create a bootable CD or USB that you can use once your HDD is removed.2)  Remove your HDD, replace it with the new SSD.3)  Boot up your computer using the bootable created in step 1.4)  Attach the old HDD via USB.5)  Use Acronis to clone from the old drive to the new.6)  Detatch the HDD and restart, booting directly from your newly cloned SSD inside.Not only is this far more complicated than the Samsung method, but the full method is not described on any leaflets that come with the drive, nor within the Acronis True Image software.  The only way I knew what to do was by searching the Acronis website for answers.Instead of messing around creating a bootable disk and following this method, I instead download the free version of Macrium Reflect.  With a few tweaks, this works almost identically to the Samsung software.  You load up the software whilst still using your old HDD, and it clones your disk over to an SSD connected via USB.  You then swap the drives over, and the job is done.  The only complication comes if you are cloning to a drive that has a smaller capacity.  With the Samsung software, the cloning process adapts to this automatically (assuming your total USED disk space does not exceed the size of your new drive).  With Macrium Reflect, you have to manually shrink partitions before beginning the cloning process.  For example, my HDD had a C: partion of 800GB, but only 150GB was used.  Macrium sees only the 800GB figure, and therefore assesses that it is too large to clone onto a 525GB SSD.  I therefore shrunk my C: partition to 200GB to ensure that it would fit on the new drive.  After the cloning process is complete, you are free to readjust your partition sizes as you wish.', ""È il mio primo SSD, dopo aver letto tanto in merito a questi solid state drive mi sono deciso a comprarne uno.Versione da 275GB per poter installare il S.O.

Nota alla pari di Samsung per gli SSD.Inutile dire quanto la spedizione di Amazon sia stata efficiente. Al contrario dei dischi meccanici il pacco per gli SSD è congruo con le aspettative, non essendo così delicati come gli HDD.Confezione e Bundle: Il design è come  molto curato, anche se minimalista, il colore predominante è il bianco.Nella parte frontale, oltre al logo dell’azienda, troviamo un’immagine che raffigura un’anteprima del drive contenuto, la serie di appartenenza e la capacità di archiviazione, in questo caso un insolito 275GB.Girando dal lato opposto la confezione troviamo l’elenco dettagliato del materiale fornito a corredo e alcune indicazioni del produttore tradotte in diverse lingue (manca l’italiano).Dopo aver aperto la confezione notiamo che sia l'SSD sia l’intero bundle fornito con lo solid state drive, sono ben riposti all'interno di un blister di plastica nero rigido.Assieme all'SSD troviamo quindi:1x Adattatore per l’installazione dell’unità in un vano da 9.5mm di spessore;1x Cartaceo riportante il seriale per l’attivazione del software di migrazione Acronis True Image HD.Specifiche tecniche:Crucial Serie: MXSerie: Crucial MX300Fattore di forma: 2.5 “Controller: Marvell 88SS1074NAND: Micron 384 Gbit TLC 3D a 32 stratiDRAM: 512MBLettura sequenziale: 530MB / sScrittura sequenziale: 510MB / sLettura casuale file 4KB: 92K IOPSScrittura casuale file 4KB: 83K IOPSModalità risparmio energetico: 4mWInattività: 75mWMassima potenza: 5.2WDurata: 220TBGaranzia: Tre anniL’interfaccia di trasmissione è ovviamente conforme allo standard SATA III a 6Gb/s, quindi il massimo ottenibile dall'interfaccia classica SATA.Al fine di garantire una buona solidità, resistenza agli urti e dissipazione del calore generato dalle componenti interne, è stato scelto l’alluminio quale materiale principale di entrambe le facce della scocca, con la parte superiore che si presenta satinata e dalle forme arrotondate.Nella parte posteriore troviamo  un’etichetta adesiva riportante il modello preciso del prodotto, con relativi numeri di serie, e un codice a barre bidimensionale (QR Code). Troviamo, inoltre, il codice PSID, indispensabile per poter sbloccare il drive nell'eventualità di smarrimento della chiave di criptazione dei dati contenuti. Questo aspetto non lo ho mai provato.Eseguito un semplice test con l'SSD occupato solo dal sistema operativo, come detto Windows 10 Pro a 64 bit.Il test si riferisce ad una misurazione delle prestazione con file da 1GB, SSD occupato in 20 GB e in uso dal sistema stesso.Dopo averlo utilizzato ormai per 3 mesi posso giungere ad una conclusione:Crucial MX300 è in competizione con i modelli Samsung EVO, quindi parliamo di una categoria intermedia di SSD.Rappresenta il giusto compromesso tra prestazioni velocistiche ed affidabilità nel tempo, senza rinunciare ad un prezzo contenuto (anche se da un po' di tempo il prezzo delle memorie NAND è in aumento, riscontrabile sia negli SSD sia nelle memorie RAM), risultando di fatto la soluzione ideale, per tutti coloro, che intendono abbandonare gli ormai vecchi e limitanti dischi rigidi tradizionali di tipo meccanico in favore di una ben più prestante unità allo stato solido (SSD), capace di donare nuova vita anche a sistemi non proprio al passo coi tempi, come ad esempio vecchi notebook o PC aziendali, pur senza dover affrontare un notevole esborso di denaro.""]"

Next, go to your control panel Disk Manager - which will automatically ask you to  initialize and format the disk.  Step 2:  Download and install the Acronis True Image software on the link provided in the manual of this drive and use the software key provide (very important: do not throw away the user manual - it contains software key)  Step 3:  Start the Acronis software and click on Backup (1st option) - it will prompt you to choose the source and destination drives and gives you an automatic/manual option - manual option allows you to adjust partition sizes.  I choose Automatic and it did an amazing job, if your destination drive is smaller/larger than the source drive, it will automatically proportion the partition sizes.  It took me 1.5 hours for a 256 GB drive (note - it will restart for it to start the backup)  Step 4:  Remove the old hard drive from laptop, insert the new SSD and you are all set', ""Fast drive, no complaints there. But the instructions that came with the box are WRONG. It tells you to go to PNY's website (they give you the URL) and download Acronis True Image HD (not the new version called 2016). One problem...there is no download link anywhere on their site. Basically you have to go find it yourself and download it, use the short code PNY provides you to get a confirmation email from Acronis and then you get sent a 64 bit activation code. A complicated and time consuming process but it worked eventually. I have to say that Acronis' UI is not as user friendly as some others, you have to make sure and look for the disk cloning, but once found it worked like a champ. Make certain that you defrag and reduce the size of your drive's partitions (primary plus 2 others for Win7)  to be less than the SSD size. You also have to remember to use Windows Disk Management to set up the SSD to start with or Acronis won't even see the drive. Search for SSD-upgrade-tutorial by laptopmag for step-by-step instructions which SHOULD come with the drives but don't.By the way, this cut by boot time by 66%.  It was a good buy at $65 but I'd gladly have paid $10 extra to have had a mini-CD which did everything without me having to search and download and email and blah.blah.blah."", ""This little solid state drive has been amazing.  I have a 5 year old laptop that has been slowing down with each day.  Recently, I purchased this drive, cloned my existing drive and then replaced the drives and it has been running like a champ ever since.  This does not come with any adapter cables and the code provided for a free download of Acronis Data Migration software does not unlock ALL of the features that Acronis has to offer.  This means, I had to purchase a separate cable to make the process easier.With the use of the Acronis Data Migration software and the separately purchased cable, I was able to clone my existing drive onto this SSD and install it into my laptop in one evening.  Minimal effort was required and I had no problems.Now that I've been using this drive for nearly 2 months my laptop is close to being like new again.  Of course, it isn't perfect (my laptop IS 5 years old after all) but my boot times are now seconds instead of minutes and I can now use my laptop again without long delays when trying to do anything.PNY is always on the top of my list, when it comes to anything PC related and they did not disappoint me with this drive.

I had to exchange one for a replacement due to slow speeds, but amazon was good about that. Once i installed the replacement sent by amazon, my computer is back to being brand new out of box. Acronis Software didn't work for me initially from windows, but i migrated using boot recovery USD made through the software which made it easier imo. Its been about a month since purchase and i am loving it. I would highly recommend this drive, due to its responsiveness and included software. The only con that i think about this is that it should have come with a utility like Sandisk's (tried Sandisk Ultra II, had to return it due to negative reviews} that would help you track your SSD's health and have Erase Utility and other cool stuff.Highly recommended SSD. 4 stars only because first product was slow and had to get a replacement, but Amazon is the best at this sort of thing.

That, along with finally giving in to the Windows 10 upgrade nagging, I decided to do both.  I first took all my pictures, music, and videos off of my drive and put them on another drive.  Then I installed the PNY 480 GB drive using the included software to clone the Windows partitions.  That alone made a big improvement.  But when I finally gave in the Win10 and loaded that, and turned all of the useless stuff off... it was just amazing.  From taking several minutes to boot up, it now boots up to the login screen in about 10 seconds!  After that, it may be another 15-30 seconds before the hard drive light quits blinking (which is what I use to determine when my computer is fully booted).  So about 45 seconds total.I highly recommend going to the Solid State Drives, no matter what OS you use.  It makes things much faster!', ""Nice fast drive. Simple install but the included transfer software is kind of crappy and is a very big download (500 Megs). To the software's credit, and perhaps to the drive's too, 150 GB transferred to this new drive in about 10 minutes. You will need an external USB drive transfer case or cable as that is not included. After the transfer, I mounted the drive in a 3.5 inch frame (also not included) and popped it into my system swapping the power and data cables from the old drive. And voila, a quick, and I do mean quick reboot later and I had screaming fast performance. A little pricey compared to other drives but I think worth it with a 10 year warranty."", 'I was going to hold out for a Samsung EVO 250GB drive to drop below my buying price when this one arrived as new stock at Amazon. I did a little googling and found some decent reviews on the drive. I have always enjoyed PNY products, and I know Amazon always stands behind what they sell, so I took the easy bet and bought the drive. I was upgrading from running an old Kingston 120GB HyperX drive, so I was very happy to see in CrystalDiskMark the PNY drive was up to 3 times faster in some tests than my old drive. Plus with the expanded space, I can now put Fallout 4 onto the hard drive too, and enjoy sub 10 second load times, versus the up to 5 minute load times I had when I ran it from a platter drive.']"

I\'d built a work around that I\'ve used most of this year utilizing 2x1TB Samsung 840 mSATA SSDs in RAID 0 on a dual mSATA to 2.5"" board (both reviewed separately here on Amazon), and it worked well, but, ran hot, and reduced battery life moderately on my Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga S1.  And then there was the issue of not being able to manage the SSDs directly in this RAID 0 setup, which meant good but not great performance.Enter the EVO 850 2TB drive.  Turned off my ATA password, then did a direct connected drive clone using Acronis True Image 2015, leaving the current RAID drive in the laptop and connecting the new 2TB Evo via USB3 and a IcyDock USB3 to SATA adapter.  Worked great and was up and running.  Tested performance without any SSD optimization and then after turning on Rapid Mode via Magician software.  Incredible results!  While the benchmarks below are synthetic, the real world performance with Rapid Mode turned on is VERY good, and noticeably faster than both the 850 stock and the previous 2x1TB 840 R0 setup.  I also used Magician to set my OS, Windows 7 Enterprise 64bit, to optimize reliability of the SSD, so the faster benchmark includes both enabling Rapid Mode and the reliability settings in the OS.Notes and Recommendations:*Optimizing SSD for your needs.  Definitely use Samsung Magician to both enable Rapid Mode and to optimize your OS settings for the type of SSD performance you want to emphasize.  Note, however, that Rapid mode does not yet work with Windows 10 and I\'ve heard mixed results on Windows 8.1.  For me, however, rooted here in Win7, Rapid Mode seems to work perfectly, and I feel like I\'m getting every drop of performance possible from the drive in my context with the help of Magician.  The Crystal DiskMark results posted below support this.*Drive Cloning.  Acronis TrueImage 2015 worked to clone current drive to the 850 Evo via USB3.  However, I could NOT restore previous Acronis drive images to the new drive successfully, though this has worked for me in the past.  I strongly suspect this an TrueImage 2015/USB3 interaction, nothing to do with the Evo 850, but sharing in case it saves someone some time.* Secure Erase the old drive.  Using Magician, secure erase only works under Windows 7 (not 8.1 or 10) + requires SATA connected drives, at least as of this posting with the latest Magician software.  So, I used the method others recommend on the web of deleting the partition on the old drive and creating a new partition, all with the drive connected to a Windows 7 machine.  Then, TRIM supposedly re-zero\'s all the data on the drive when the new partition is created, providing a kind of secure erase. Had no way to test the efficacy of this, but did it anyway as an additional security measure on the old drive.  Here\'s hoping Magician gets updates such that these workarounds are not necessary.DiskMark results follow, in reverse chronological order:ThinkPad S1 YogaC Drive, 1x2TB Samsung 850 Evo with Rapid Mode turned on and optimized via Magician for reliability-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.1 x64 (C) 2007-2010 hiyohiyo  Crystal Dew World : http://crystalmark.info/-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]  Sequential Read :  2081.885 MB/s  Sequential Write :  1062.522 MB/s  Random Read 512KB :  3233.240 MB/s  Random Write 512KB :  1227.072 MB/s  Random Read 4KB (QD=1) :  327.188 MB/s [ 79879.9 IOPS]  Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  176.897 MB/s [ 43187.7 IOPS]  Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  405.226 MB/s [ 98932.0 IOPS]  Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  236.319 MB/s [ 57694.9 IOPS]  Test : 1000 MB [C: 53.8% (1001.5/1862.7 GB)] (x3)  Date : 2015/08/25 3:04:47  OS : Windows 7 Enterprise Edition SP1 [6.1 Build 7601] (x64)C Drive, 1x2TB Samsung 850 Evo-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.1 x64 (C) 2007-2010 hiyohiyo  Crystal Dew World : http://crystalmark.info/-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]  Sequential Read :  512.000 MB/s  Sequential Write :  408.695 MB/s  Random Read 512KB :  471.074 MB/s  Random Write 512KB :  369.942 MB/s  Random Read 4KB (QD=1) :  37.702 MB/s [  9204.6 IOPS]  Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  87.897 MB/s [ 21459.2 IOPS]  Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  308.968 MB/s [ 75431.6 IOPS]  Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  179.177 MB/s [ 43744.3 IOPS]  Test : 1000 MB [C: 54.3% (1012.0/1862.7 GB)] (x3)  Date : 2015/08/21 0:15:49  OS : Windows 7 Enterprise Edition SP1 [6.1 Build 7601] (x64)C Drive, 2X1TB Samsung EVO 840 in RAID 0 on-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.1 x64 (C) 2007-2010 hiyohiyo  Crystal Dew World : http://crystalmark.info/-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]  Sequential Read :  489.531 MB/s  Sequential Write :  355.169 MB/s  Random Read 512KB :  399.607 MB/s  Random Write 512KB :  331.641 MB/s  Random Read 4KB (QD=1) :  30.740 MB/s [  7505.0 IOPS]  Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  87.171 MB/s [ 21282.0 IOPS]  Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  53.773 MB/s [ 13128.1 IOPS]  Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  184.967 MB/s [ 45157.9 IOPS]  Test : 1000 MB [C: 38.3% (713.7/1862.7 GB)] (x3)  Date : 2015/04/25 0:44:06  OS : Windows 7 Enterprise Edition SP1 [6.1 Build 7601] (x64)', ""I bought the 250 GB version of this drive to upgrade my existing system's boot drive. The original drive was 1 TB however it was very loud (it's a server-grade drive).The drive came with the normal warranty paperwork, installation CD for Samsung Magician and Data Migration as well as a pictograph guide for setting up the drive in both desktops and laptops. Unless you have mounting screws on hand, you will need to purchase some as none were included. This is the same as the SATA and power cables (if you're using a modular power supply); you will need to either use what you have or purchase more.The installation guide is extremely simple and does not cover troubleshooting so beware! I did a fair bit of research to make sure that I had everything I needed. I happened to have mounting screws and extra cables so I was good there.Another thing to keep in mind is the fact that this is a 2.5 inch drive; unless you have a mounting bracket to fit this form factor into a 3.5 inch bay, you will need to purchase one. If you're using this in laptop, be sure to read your paperwork to see if this drive is best for you and get any/all hardware you may need. If you're not planning on using it as an internal drive, then this is not a problem.After installation, I booted up and configured the drive as a new volume and installed both Magician and Data Migration. To be fair, I was leery of using the stock migration software as I've read that a fair portion of people using it to transfer their OS were having trouble. I used MiniTool Partition Wizard's OS Migration Wizard (available at www.cnet.com) which was seamless. Keep in mind that this is my two cents; your mileage may vary.Word of caution: Back up everything. I backed up my system on an external hard drive and copied all important data (pictures, documents, music, etc) again onto a flash drive. I could be paranoid however better safe than sorry.After rebooting, I started Magician and enabled RAPID mode. Another reboot and presto! While my boot up time isn't all that improved, the entire system is much more responsive and snappy. Programs open quickly and painlessly. When moving through pictures I no longer have to wait for them to load. Opening Adobe Lightroom used to take up to a minute and now only takes about 4 seconds. Likewise opening my iTunes sometimes took almost a minute now opens and is ready in less than a second.  My read and write speeds are both near the advertised maximums.All-in-all, I've very happy with my new drive. Installation was easy and straightforward. I would purchase one of these again in a heartbeat. Below I put two links for a mounting bracket and screws.

It is now installed and working well, but it was a struggle to get it working.  The struggle had nothing to do with the Samsung SSD, but instead with a defective SATA drive cable in my MBP, and with MacOS Sierra\'s App Translocation feature.First, if you own the same model of MBP as mine, order a replacement SATA drive cable and replace it along with the drive.  It is a known issue in the mid-2012 13"" MacBook Pro for this cable to go bad due to the bottom of the case pressing on it.  You\'ll know you have a bad cable if you cannot format or erase the Samsung SSD when it is installed internally, but you can erase it if it is installed in an external USB enclosure.If you are upgrading your drive, the new App Translocation security feature on MacOS Sierra will cause both Carbon Copy Cloner and a direct restore via Time Machine restore to fail if you are upgrading to a larger Samsung SSD. Sierra behaves as if the software had been transferred to a ""new"" computer, and prevents numerous background programs from running or starting up correctly. My ultimate solution was the following:(1) Create a bootable USB installer for MacOS Sierra using the free Disk Creator utility from MacDaddy with an 8 GB USB flash drive.(2) Remove your old HD or SSD from your laptop and place it in an external USB enclosure (very cheap, many enclosures available from Amazon), after performing a Time Machine backup.(3) Install the new SATA cable and the new Samsung SSD in your MBP, insert the USB installer flash drive, and install a fresh copy of MacOS.(4) When the installer asks if you want to transfer data from another source, attach the USB enclosure containing your old HD / SSD. Once it mounts, you can tell the installer to select the old drive and transfer your applications and user data.This SSD has given my 4-year-old MBP new life, and should hopefully allow me to go two or three more years before I need to buy a new laptop.  Applications now open almost immediately, e.g. Mathematica in 4 seconds, Microsoft Word in 2 seconds, etc.  This is a great upgrade for any older MacBook Pro, and I heartily recommend it.', ""2016-10-04So far these drives have been great and very fast.

One thing I would like to mention is that the speed of the drive is really going to be relative to the speed and back-end of the computer.  The drive may be really fast, but an older computer my have a slower back-end and might throttle the speed a bit. We buy used Dell M6600's, take then apart, modify them, and then run them until they die.  So far none of them have died.  I will not reveal the mods.  However, the drives run very fast and write at 421.5 MB/sec.  So far there have been no problems and our developers are addicted to these drives.  Will buy more.  The expense is offset when you save time in waiting and frustration.  Hope this helps.Ok, I do not work for Samsung.  I run a corporation and we do not run ridiculous operating systems like Windows for our offices.  We have some modified laptops with 2 hard drives.  I decided to try this drive for my Linux based laptop and replaced one of the 1TB hybrid drives, which were already fast.  This drive has been spectacular so far.  For Linux I formatted the drive for the EXT4 format, copied the files from the old drive, plugged in, and turned it on. This was not a boot drive.  The other hybrid drive still does that.  Its was really like grab the computer and hold on.  Typical write times for the Hybrid drive was 85.6 MB/s.  Typical write speeds for the Samsung drive was 421.5 MB/s.  Its basically a 5 times speed increase for writing.  I never even looked at the CD that comes with the drive.  Linux handles drives much better than windows and we run any windows instances on top of Linux anyway.  Its more stable.  I am probably going to buy more of these drives.  Expensive yes, time is money though and I want to get one for one of my engineers.  There may be better drives.  I am not an expert, but this one made a big difference for me.  Enjoy."", 'Got this as a replacement boot drive for my iMac 27"", which came with an internal 1TB 7200rpm HDD. Using a USB3 adapter, I\'m getting 250-270MB/sec for read and write using the BlackMagic test. This is most likely more a reflection on the limitation of the adapter I got than of the drive itself. Will need to test it on a powered USB3 dock I have, which gives better performance later. Same for when I get a TB2 to SATAIII adapter.Before the 850EVO, it was taking about a minute to boot up the iMac on the HDD. With the SSD, I\'m now booting up in half that time. Application startup is also greatly improved. Moving the caching and previews for Lightroom made browsing a catalog gallery\'s preview images nearly instant thanks to the low latency of the SSD. This is a huge improvement over even the performance I was getting from my ARECA 8050T2 raid array(granted, the array is spinning disks). An array populated with these 2TB SSD would provide a strong mix of throughput and iops.Giving the drive 5/5 stars because it is exactly what is advertised. At the price point when I got it, it was a good deal for the 2TB version vs the 1TB version. I opted for the 2TB drive vs the 1TB since Mac OSX\'s HFS+ encounters a serious performance hit once the filesystem gets close to filling up, it\'s a good idea to have more space than you need, even if it is an SSD.Will be interesting to see whether the endurance on the drive lives up to expectations.Will update once I\'ve done an internal swap of this drive with the iMac\'s internal HDD. Should see better performance at that point, without the USB-SATA conversion.', ""I was looking to find the most amount of SSD storage that is under $1000, and it seems like Samsung's 850 EVO 2TB and 850 PRO 2TB was the highest capacity ones on PcPartPicker that was under $1000 (btw: if you don't use that site when shopping for PC Parts, you should).Just for comparison, my previous setup was 2 OCZ Vector 3 120GB running in Raid 0, with a standard 7200RPM 1.5TB Hard Drive. So I replaced all 3 of these drives with a single 2TB SSD.You would think 2 SSDs in Raid 0 would be faster than 1 SSD, but no, the single 2TB was faster than the Raid 0 in boot up, login, and in almost all practical applications. Now, I did not actually take any measurements, but it definitely is faster based on the fact that the Windows loading circle used to have to spin 5 times, but now it only spins 2 times. Plus, now I don't get that annoying Intel RAID screen before boot and also can install all my games on the SSD!So why only 4 stars? $620 (that's how much I paid for it) is still too expensive for my taste. I consider $0.25/gb a fair price, and $0.20/gb a great deal. Unfortunately, $0.31/gb is a little more expensive than I would personally like.  However, if you can cough up the money, then you won't be disappointed."", ""Given that a 1Gbps fiber cable into my basement costs $60 a month, the FPS-like chaos of the nonsensical pricing and repricing of cloud storage, and the steady free fall of local storage cost, it's simply indulgent to put this amount of money into any storage device.  In this case it's the primary source of a media library along side a PCIe M.2 system disc (which makes this SATA interface look lazy) in an Intel NUC.  Every once in a while transcoding video makes me wish for a stack of Xeon cores, but otherwise the system is a tiny little dream come true.The caution is in the way I started the review; don't consider this expense unless you have at least 1.5TB of data you HAVE to store locally.  Buy as little as you need and take as a given that by the time you need more capacity, everything will have fallen in price.  The changes in the cost of bandwidth, at least in urban areas, the cost of local and cloud storage, and the real-world bandwidth of 802.11 standards are all inter-related at a consumer level, so keep an eye on the bottleneck in the chain, and don't overspend today."", ""Just purchased and installed this on my Dell laptop. Of course, having 2 TB of SSD space is great. Only time will tell as to its reliability, but I do have a criticism: the Samsung migration software is incredibly easy to use, except it didn't work. I received some sort of generic error message. Since I had no idea what was generating the message, I did not want to take a risk that some important file had been corrupted. So I ended up using third-party software to migrate which ended up taking a substantial amount of time to migrate. The bottom line is that if the software works for you, great, but if not, be prepared to spend a fair amount of time migrating. If you are installing this SSD for a fresh install, then hopefully you will have fewer problems. I do plan to redo my installation sometime from a Windows CD, and I will update my review after I do that. Bottom line, if you need 2 TB SSD this is the only game in town. Since I really needed the storage space, I am glad I got it, but I am not happy that the software that came with it did not work for me at least.I think an SSD is indispensable for computer, and 2 TB really is something I've wanted for a while. Though the drive costs more than the computer, it will be worth it as long as it proves to be reliable."", ""I originally had 2 1TB in each laptop and each slave drive was 500GB SSD, I replaced the 2 1TB and made them slaves and now have 2TB as the master in both laptops,Installation took about 45 minutes and had to bend the tabs to align the screws for the ssd cases and hopefully this should not be done again1 ASUS G75VW 16 GB 2 TB SSD as master, 1TB SSD as slave1 ASUS G751JY 32 GB 2 TB SSD as master, 1TB SSD as slaveApproximately 25 to 30 sec's to boot into windows 10 Enterprise Editionx64I am doing a clean install and not using any acronis backups and installing the same software in each laptop and after every installation I then create a system restore pointUsing KeyLemon for picture recognition (Free Edition) and this is faster then the asus facial recognition software and of course there is a backup password in case the keylemon failsSo where am i , have office 2016 (X64) installed on both laptops, Adobe Acrobat DC also installed on both laptops and then of course had to configure outlook 2016 for a few email accounts, along with quicken 2016"", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Simply mounting a volume from this SSD caused painful lags in file operations in OS X El Capitan, across the board for files that did not reside on this volume. The video demonstrates an excruciating delay in a simple test case, opening a small TIFF file that reside on my internal SSD on my new iMac 5K. When no volumes are mounted from this Samsung 850 EVO 2 TB SSD, the TIFF file opens immediately. When I mount a volume from this Samsung SSD, there is an excruciating delay in opening this TIFF file. I reproduced this behavior in multiple enclosures, using both Thunderbolt and USB3. I could not reproduce this behavior with other brands of SSD.Mac OS X has always had a problem handling a mix of mechanical and solid state external drives; operating system after operating system, it waits for all mounted drives to spin up on most file operations, rather than assuming a default that file operations will access the system volume. The controller on this Samsung SSD is introducing a ""virtual"" spin up lag on these file operations. As I care about fixing Apple\'s design spec for volume handling, this Samsung SSD is a researcher\'s gift, like discovering a lab rat prone to cancer. However, I\'m not so happy about having spent $650 on an SSD with such a sloppy controller.Spending time on the phone with Apple, Samsung, and Other World Computing, it was clear that Samsung support isn\'t the coldest beer in the fridge. They will honor my warranty, whatever that means (we\'ll see if the problem goes away), but they could offer no diagnostic help, and they took issue with my using an ""internal"" drive in an external enclosure. No appreciation of standards compliance, more of a flailing attempt to cast blame elsewhere, and they didn\'t get my joke when I referred to their stance as a ""sodomy"" law. Apple in contrast recognized that I knew more than first responder AppleCare, and promoted me to a senior tech who may in fact fix this problem with OS X.Samsung welcomed my intention to warn people not to buy this ""internal"" drive for external enclosures. Huh. Be forewarned.']"

Irgendwann für 138,39 als Blitzangebot gekauft. Die PRO sind mir zu teuer und ich brauche nicht zwingend Platten, die 10 Jahren halten, bis dahin, falls ich noch lebe, werden sie sowieso um 75 % billiger. Also muß ich nicht mein Kapital dafür langfristig binden.- Samsung 840 PRO. Da habe ich noch eine davon. Sie ist vielleicht 4-5 Jahre alt und scheint unsterblich zu sein.- Samsung 750 EVO. War als Blitzangebot am Prime Day für 108,69 Euro super günstig, also her damit.- Toshiba Q300 PRO, eine gute Alternative zu Samsung, damals für etwa 160 Euro ziemlich günstig- Diese Transcend SSD370S, als Blitzangebot für 137,90, also her damit.- Sandisk Extreme Pro 480 GB (so gut wie 0,5 TB). Monatelang habe ich sie bei Amazon vergeblich beobachtet, aber sie blieb bei 180 Euro. So habe ich gestern bei der Bucht gleich zwei fast neuwertige für rd. 105 Euro pro Stück gekauft.- Intel 320 Series 600 GB: Von zwei ist bereits eine krepiert, würde ich nicht wieder kaufen.Dazu noch eine Transcend 256 GB weil sie als Blitzangebot günstig war, aber für einen Notebook mit nur einem HDD-Platz, eigentlich zu knapp. Würde ich nicht wieder kaufen.Die einzigen Premium SSD, die ich noch nicht testen könnte sind die Kingston HyperX Savage, die Sandisk X400 und die Crucial MX300, weil die Preise bisher einfach zu hoch und einfach nicht sinken wollten.Insgesamt haben wir diese o.g. SSDs in 5 Laptops, meistens zwei pro Gerät wenn genug Platz vorhanden ist.Sie erlauben Startgeschwindigkeiten, die - je nach Konfiguration - ab 15 Sekunden liegen und i.d.R. doppelt bis dreimal kürzer sind als mit den Premium HDDs von Seagate, WD, Hitachi und Toshiba, die wir vorher drin hatten.Wenn Bearbeitugssoftware und Dateien auf SSDs sind, was bei uns der Fall ist - dann werden die Dateien ohne gefühlte Wartezeiten am Bildschirm bereit gestellt.Ob die eine oder andere SSD schneller ist oder nicht ist ziemlich egal, die Unterschiede sind minimal, vielleicht eine oder zwei Sekunden beim Start.Deswegen würde ich mir kein Kopf machen, die o.g. lohnen sich alle, bis auf die zwei, die ich nicht mehr kaufen würde.SSDs werden mit der Zeit zunächst etwas schneller weil das Puffer und die Algorythmen besser arbeiten, dann langsamer weil sie immer voller werden und Reseve-Sektoren für die fehlerhaften aktiviert werden (Overprovisioning). Aber auch das hat in der Praxis reine akademische Bedeutung.Diese Transcend finde ich mit z.Z. 161 Euro ein wenig zu teuer, es geht nicht um grosse Beträge, aber immerhin genug um sich z.B. eine praktische ICY-Box zu leisten um eine externe HDD reinzustecken und als externer Masserspeicher zu verwenden.Pfennigfuchser werden die Samsung 750 EVo oder die Sandisk für 120 Euro bevorzügen, das läßt genug Geld über für eine neuwertige 1 TB HDD, die als Massenspeicher ohnehin besser geeignet ist.Andererseits ist die 370 S eine MLC, das heißt, es werden 2 Informationen pro Zelle gespeichert. Bei den preiswertesten SSDs werden 3 oder mehr Informationen pro Zelle gespeichert. Das verkürzt die Lebensdauer und erhöht die Fehlerquote. Ich glaube sogar exponential.Bei SSDs gehen bei jeden Schreibvorgang die Stromkanäle ein wenig mehr kaputt, bei Lesevorgänge gibt es keine Begrenzung.Wer intensiv die Festplatte benutzt ist also mit dieser Transcend vermutlich besser bedient.Und da kommen wir zum weiteren Nachteil der SSDs im Allgemeinen.1 GB kostet z.Z. bei dieser Transcend 31,5 cents, bei einer 1 TB HDD aber rd. 4,5 cents.Wenn man also ganz viele Daten sichern möchte, und das macht man i.d.R. über Nacht so das Zeit keine Rolle spielt, dann ist eine 1TB HDD das Richtige. Natürlich kann man auch kleinere noch günstiger Kaufen wenn man nicht so ein Bedarf hat. Aber kleine HDDs werden in Zukunft kaum verkäuflich sein und der Preisunterschied liegt oft bei einem Zwanziger.In unsere Familie benutzen wir vier WD My Passport Ulta 2TB um vor allem Fotos und Videos zu speichern.Die gibt es ab 80 Euro bis rd. 110 Euro.Die Metal Edition ist ca. 10-15 Euro teuerer, sieht aber wunderschön aus und ist weniger kratzempfindlich als die Hochglanz-Ausführung.aus Plastik.Es gibt auch diese Baureihe bis 4 TB, aber man muss bedenken, daß sie emfindlicher sind und wenn ein Crash erfolgt, dann ist es besser die Dateien auf mehreren kleineren HDDs zu verteilen.Ausserdem haben wir auch Seagate Expansion 2 TB und zwei Toshiba Stor.e und sind sehr zufrieden damit. Sie sind sehr empfehlenswert.Besonders viel Lob verdient meine Platinum 500 GB, die seit fast 10 Jahren täglich im Einsatz ist und noch perfekt läuft.Alle diese 2,5 Zoll-Platten in Gehäuse fest eingebaut kann ich wirklich empfehlen. Wenn man sie benutzt, reicht eine Transcend SSD370S mit 512 GB allemal, weil die o.g. HDDs als Massenspeicher fungieren.Man kann sie natürlich mühelos von einem Rechner zum Anderen transportieren und anschliessen.Wer braucht da noch Cloud ?Die nächste Lösung sind interne Festplatten, die man selber in Gehäuse reinsteckt und die SSD im Rechner ergänzen.Das ist am peiswertesten.Ich kam dazu, weil durch den Ersatz durch SSDs, ich über eine habe Dutzend HDDs hatte, die zunächst in einem Schukarton landeten und dort zunächst vergessen wurden.Abgesehen von den 3.5 Zoll-Festplatten, die teuere Docking-Stations mit Stromversorgung benötigen und Kabelsalat verursachen, sind diese kleinen, nackten Festplatten eine feine Sache. Man kann sie auch jederzeit im Notebbok wieder einbauen, falls die Festplatte dort crashen sollte. Das dauert nur Minuten. Die Installation natürlich nicht, sie Dauert 1 halben Tag.Da eine SSD selten alleine kommt, hier sehr Kompakte und zuverlässige HDDs als Ergänzng für Massenspeicherung:- WD Scorpio Blue 1.0 TB WD10JPVT- Toshiba L200 und H200 (Größe nach Bedarf)- Samsung M8 HN-M101MBB- Seagate Laptop SSHD- Hitachi Travelstar 5K1000 und 7K1000Die Hitachi drehen mit 7.200 U/min, die Anderen mit 5.400 U/min. Sie sind also etwas schneller aber auch ein wenig wärmer.Dazu als 2,5 Zoll Gehäuse:- Icy Box IB-AC603a-U3 USB 3.0 zu SATA II (15 Euro) sehr kurzes 14 cm-Kabel, fest gelötet, durchsichtige Tupperdose- CSL - USB 3.0 2,5"" SSD / SATA Festplattengehäuse extern (10 Euro, Alles Plastik, aber schön)- CnMemory Leergehäuse Zinc 2,5 Zoll USB 3.0 HDD Festplatten-Alu-Gehäuse (8,90 Euro bei Rohling Express, sehr schön, braucht TX6-Schraubenzieher).Es macht natürlich sehr viel Spaß seine eigene externe Festplatte durch Kombination von HDD / SSD und Gehäuse, die es meistens in vielen Farben gbt, zu schaffen.Dazu ein Premium-Kabel, z.B. von Roline Gold oder AmazonBasics und man hat ein schönes und exklusives Teil, das auch noch deutlich preiswerter ist als eine Standard externe Festplatte.Viel Spaß !', 'Die interne 2.5"" SSD von Transcend Highspeed mit 512GB ist klein und handlich.

Mi riferisco ad alcuni MacBook o i modelli attuali di IMac che per aprirli non è una passeggiata. Se hai deciso che è il momento di sostituire l’hd meccanico con una unità SSD, allora hai tre possibilità:1.“fai da te” con i kit per lo smontaggio/rimontaggio dello schermo e mooolta pazienza e tempo da perdere;2. Cacci i soldi e ti rivolgi ai centri specializzati3. Non tocchi niente e compri un ssd esterno.Come avrete capito io ho optato per la soluzione 3, per vari motivi che non mi dilungo a spiegarvi per non allungare troppo questa recensione. Quindi vado subito a dirvi perché si e perché no il transcend.Prima di tutto evidenzio che io ho un iMac late 2012 con fusion drive. Le prestazioni di boot sono ancora decenti; il problema però è l’apertura di programmi e, visto che lavoro in ambiente virtuale, l’avvio delle virtual machine. Ancora niente di drammatico però il collo di bottiglia dell’Hdd datato comincia a dare fastidio. Quindi come detto provo la strada del SSD esterno, in un Mac senza usb C e con porte thunderbolt di tipo 2.Acquistare un SSD con porta USB o thunderbolt è stata una valutazione ponderata, ma alla fine ho deciso di prendere questo transcend proprio perché ha la connessione thunderbolt nativa (oltre alla usb tipo 3). Ed ecco i pro e i contro della scelta rispetto ad una connessione USB (ricordo, questo transcend potete tranquillamente connetterlo anche alle porte usb)PRO il vantaggio più grande che mi ha fatto propendere per la thunderbolt è che queste connessioni non consumano risorse al contrario di una soluzione su porta usb. Se, per esempio provate a collegare due Hdd su porte usb anche diverse, le prestazioni in lettura/scrittura dei dischi e complessive del PC/Mac decadono anche notevolmente. Questo non succede se collegate qualsiasi periferica, anche assetata di corrente, alla porta thunderbolt. In più preservate “un buco” USB per altre periferiche.CONTRO le porte thunderbolt 2 sono purtroppo obsolete e, pertanto, non c’è molto disponibile sul mercato. Io ho trovato solo la transcend che commercializza ancora prodotti su thunderbolt 2. Il problema è che è tecnologia di circa 7-8 anni fa che viene pagata a carissimo prezzo. Il contro più grande è infatti il costo di questo SSD che rispetto alle soluzioni su USB costa veramente tanto di più. Questa è la spiegazione delle tre stelle.Per il resto l’unità fa il suo dovere, sia connettendola con usb che con thunderbolt (nella confezione sono presenti entrambi i cavi). Velocità non fulminee però decisamente migliorati i tempi di caricamento. Sono estremamente soddisfatto del risultato ottenuto con questa soluzione “light”. Certo se si vuole il top del restyling, occorre per forza aprire la macchina e utilizzare unità SSD di ultima generazione. Consigliato solo se avete altri HD collegati ale porte Usb (io ho il disco time machine) e non ve la sentite di aprire l’IMac.', ""C'est le 5e disque SSD de 1 To que j'achète tout simplement parce que j'ai été satisfait des précédents.Bien évidemment j'ai dû le re-formater en ex-FAT pour avoir une compatibilité totale avec un PC Windows et la Mac, aussi bien en lecture qu'en écriture.Ce SSD chauffe beaucoup plus lorsqu'il est connecté enThunderbolt qu'en USB 3, malgré que dans le 1er cas je n'ai pas trouvé qu'il était plus rapide (constaté sur MacBookPro fin 2013 et iMac Retina 5k de nov 2014)L'avantage du port Thunderbolt c'est qu'il laisse libre les ports USB du MacBookPro, car il n'y en a que deux !Le boitier du disque SSD est métallique, et d'après la notice est capable d'encaisser des chocs importants, je n'ai pas testé, mais c'est rassurant.La livraison par Amazon est assez rapide, par contre je trouve pas très normal que l'envoi ne se fasse pas sans contre signature.Évidemment dans ces conditions mon facteur ne connaissant pas la valeur de ce petit colis, va le considérer comme étant une lettre ordinaire et en cas d'absence à tendance à le balancer par dessus mon portail dans mon jardin !"", ""Allora. Quello che dico è rifarito al modella da 256 GB. Ho usato diversi ssd, anche se qualcuno si lamenta di questo 370s io lo trovo quasi ottimo. Lo ho sostituito ad un hd meccanico su un nb. Non so cosa si aspettano le altre persone come velocità, a me interessano poco i numeri. Questo ssd costa poco ed ha caratteristiche ottime. Ha una cache ddr3 da 512 MB, ha memoria MLC (2 bit) e questa è la cosa piu importante. Ho anche un samsung 850 evo da 250 regalatomi da un amico che ha celle  TLC (3 bit). Ho un OCZ ARC 100 da 256 che è molto simole al 370. L'EVO è molto inferiore agli altri due e si vede quando carico ad esempio google earth su quale ho decine di migliaia di kmz. Il Trascend e l'OCZ sono velocissimi, dopo uso intenso per piu di un anno  sono sempre efficienti, molto vicini al samsung 850 pro 256 gb che ha celle MLC. Non cercherei un numero in piu o uno in meno. Consiglio a chi legge queste considerazioni di evitare tutto quello che è TLC anche se scrivono 3D o V-NAND che non servono a niente, chi se ne frega se la memoria è impilata o planare, quello che conta è una buona cache con ram (non la SLC simulata con la TLC, attenzione), le la NAND MLC. Evitate come la rogna la TLC che è molto fragile e può dare errori oltre ad essere lenta nella scrittura. Un'altra cosa, mentre per le cpu il processo produrttivo è importante, quanto piu piccolo è meglio è (14 nm vs 28 nm ad es.) nella NAND meglio scegliere quella piu sostanziosa come il 20 nm di questo ssd. Esempio Crucial fa la MLC ma usa la Toshiba a 16 nm a differenza di questo che usa la 20 nm ed è molto meglio questa. Andate tranquilli con questo o con l'ARC 100 o con l'850 pro o altri che usano una buona cache e la Nand MLC. Non fativi trascinare da cretinate come una velocità un po piu grande, badate al sodo. Se sostituite un hd meccanico con un ssd MLC decente, vedete come il mondo cambia. é come una fotocopiatrice digitale per uno studio professionale. Chi la scopre non capisce come ha potuto fare fino al quel momento. Un'ultima cosa, se dovete installare un sistema operativo, per evitare di usurare l'SSD installatelo prima su uno meccanico, fate tutte le modifiche come abilitare il TRIM, eliminare l'ibernazione, la memoria virtuale, ecc. (vedete una guida) e poi copiatelo con acronis sul SSD. Infine godetevelo. Ancora una piccola cosa. se averte solo 4gb di ram non vi lamentate dell'SSD."", ""I gave this 4 stars because of the lack of cloning software along with other option you would get with a Samsung SSD.  I bought this because I  wanted to try something different, and have had good luck with Transcend products in the past.  I own 2 Samsung 850 Pro's and 1 Samsung 850 EVO, and there is very noticeable difference between Samsung and this Transcend model.  I bought this drive to go into a Toshiba Satellite Radius 11 L15W‑B1302.  I couldn't get the Toshiba to read the drive, so I put it in an external drive case and plugged it into my Lenovo, and still no luck.  I finally had luck with my HP laptop and was able to format the drive.  I had to go this route because my Toshiba wouldn't even recognize the drive so I could do a fresh install of Windows.  My Lenovo acknowledged the drive, but I was locked out of it and could do nothing.The Software that Transcend offers didn't work for cloning....  At all!!  After going through a handful of cloning software, attempt #5 was a winner.  I downloaded and installed Macrium Reflect v6 Free Edition, and it worked without a hitch. The only issue, is that if you're going to a smaller drive(SSD), you need to resize your C partition do that everything fits on the SSD.  DO NOT delete any partitions from your HDD.  I found that even deleting an unused partition will move the location/order of you files, and the drive will not boot.  I didn't have this issue with Samsung, but after multiple tests with this SSD, I found this to be the case.  Your files will be on the drive, but will register as nonexistent when trying to boot into Windows.  After reading up on a few different sites, I found that others have had or are having the same issue with this SSD.  Changing nothing except for the size of your C partition has no effect other than changing its size, and the clone will be identical.In the end, the drive works well and is significantly faster.  Would I buy another Transcend SSD? NO...  I'll stick with Samsung because I know the product."", 'This one has best price to performace ratio .. I almost bought 850 Evo over this but then i decided to save 1k Rs and got this on .The performance difference between these two is only theoretical , which you will never notice in the real world scenarios .If someone is upgrading from an HDD , then i would suggest that they should buy either this one or the 850 evo (if money isnt the problem).And if you want something cheap and acceptable yet a huge performance boost over any HDD on the planet they can even get the kingston v300 or the hyperX (but i got this transcend with 10% cashback so basically it costed me 5.2k , other SSDs like kingston are priced at 4.4k so getting this one was no brainer).Now lets talk about the performance .Laptop : Samsung NP300E5V-S02INi3-3120M (3rd gen Obvi.)my previous HDD was a SATA2 one so performance was stupidly slow for me.after installing this SSD i can boot up my laptop , launch chrome , open youtube and play a video under 20 SECONDS.Apps loads up in few seconds which used to take 20-30 seconds even after that it would still be loading . now remember that i have an i3 laptop. just imagine what kind of performance one can get on a high end laptop or a desktop.my honest suggestion is ...IF any one of you with a laptop that costs more than 50k , you must install an SSD to unleash the true power . doesnt matter if you have a gaming rig or a gaming laptop , it will still be slower than an entry level laptop with an SSD(in every day tasks , not processor intensive tasks)and ... if you want to get rid of that ""windows explorer stopped responding "" or if you are tired of a pc\\laptop becoming unresponsive while transferring data from\\to an external HDD... Then the only solution (actually a cheap one) is installing an SSDNow what about storage issues?you can buy a higher capacity SSD which are costlier or you can install your HDD back into the laptop with an HDD caddyBattery life / Power consumption :i know you would be concerned if you had read the anandtech\'s review of 370S(this ssd), they said it consumes more power when its under load ..BUT whatever that load will be that would lasts only few seconds which in turn consumes alot lesser power than any HDD which would have to run(spin) longer to complete that task. and if you still care about that marginal difference in power consumption then you can always buy the samsubg 850 evo(which is also a great choice) but the difference is very very small and exists only in a theoretical perspective.benchmarks are attached (to be honest benchmarks are only numbers , never take any decision solely based on benchmarks)', '4ヶ月ほど前(2015年)の暑い夏に購入しました。1Tのモデルです。小型のマイクロサーバに装着しています。結論から申しましょう。安定\u3000アンド\u3000早い\u3000and\u3000速い！Trancend 製もいいかも---------------------------------------------------------------------購入から2年後に追記寿命を迎えたかもしれません。------------ 以下どこがおかしいのか調べてみましたがわかりませんでした ---------------Openblocks AX3 というマイクロサーバで使用していましたがライトの際に止まるようになりました。原因を探りましたが、HDDへの書き込みもできないためsyslogもあてになりません。syslogを別ホストに送ってみたり、コンソール(RS-232C経由)に出力しても原因の特定には至りませんでした。これ多分寿命かファームウェアのコントローラでしょうね。ext4で使用しており18時間程度かけて fsck で修復しても改善せず。trim設定をon/offとかを試してもダメでした。WindowsマシンにUSB-3経由のSATA3で接続してファームウェアの更新も試みましたがうまくいかず。(SATAに刺しなおしてまで更新したくない)ファームウェア N1114H が最新かどうかは知りません。SMARTの診断結果を見ても特におかしなところは見受けられませんでした。(というか値があてになっていない気がする)root@hostname:~# smartctl -a /dev/sda1Device Model:  TS1TSSD370SFirmware Version: N1114HUser Capacity:  1,024,209,543,168 bytes [1.02 TB]Sector Size:  512 bytes logical/physical\u3000\u3000---------- 省略 -------------\u3000  5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct  0x0000  100  100  000  Old_age  Offline  -  0  9 Power_On_Hours  0x0000  100  100  000  Old_age  Offline  -  2289160 Unknown_Attribute  0x0000  100  100  000  Old_age  Offline  -  0161 Unknown_Attribute  0x0000  100  100  000  Old_age  Offline  -  102163 Unknown_Attribute  0x0000  100  100  000  Old_age  Offline  -  53164 Unknown_Attribute  0x0000  100  100  000  Old_age  Offline  -  23454168 Unknown_Attribute  0x0000  100  100  000  Old_age  Offline  -  3000169 Unknown_Attribute  0x0000  100  100  000  Old_age  Offline  -  100176 Erase_Fail_Count_Chip  0x0000  100  100  000  Old_age  Offline  -  0192 Power-Off_Retract_Count 0x0000  100  100  000  Old_age  Offline  -  22194 Temperature_Celsius  0x0000  100  100  000  Old_age  Offline  -  42195 Hardware_ECC_Recovered  0x0000  100  100  000  Old_age  Offline  -  18514197 Current_Pending_Sector  0x0000  100  100  000  Old_age  Offline  -  0232 Available_Reservd_Space 0x0000  100  100  000  Old_age  Offline  -  100241 Total_LBAs_Written  0x0000  100  100  000  Old_age  Offline  -  251768242 Total_LBAs_Read  0x0000  100  100  000  Old_age  Offline  -  237584245 Unknown_Attribute  0x0000  100  100  000  Old_age  Offline  -  375264SMARTの特筆すべきは、・ID 5 の再配置可能なセクタ数が0ですね。代わりとなるセクタがないのでエラーがあっても再配置されないのでしょう。さらにID 197 の現在の再配置待ちセクタ数が0ということは現段階では見受けられないが再配置するようなエラーがあった際に・・・（コントーラ次第だが多分とぶ。これ以上どうしようもないから）・また、ID 9 の稼働時間が 2289時間ということは日数に直すと95日という時点であやしい結果な気がします。(まともな値なら約27か月(810日ほど) 連続稼働していたと見積もると 19,440 時間前後を指していないといけないはず)ほか、ID 160(Uncorrectable sectors count when read/write) の R/W時の訂正不可なセクタ数が0、ID 161(Number of Valid Spare Blocks) のスペアブロック数が102、ID 176  の消去失敗が0(というのがありえるの?)、ID 195 の H/W ECC リカバリが18514、ID 245(Flash Write Sector Count) でしょう。さてさて、欲張って1TBのMLCなんて手を出すからこうなったのでしょう。安定性を求めるなら、容量の少ないSLC(値段が高い)でしょう。SLCが1セルに対して1ビット記録できるのに対し、MLC(この製品)は2ビット(on/off, on/off)記録できます。MLCは1セルの情報量が倍のため大容量化を実現しているんですね。(なおSLCが10万回の書き換え可能なら、MLCは1万回程度と言われています)つまり、SLCに対して1/10程度の耐久性しかありません。また、TLC(トリプルセル)、QLC(クアッドセル)に至っては3,000～5,000回しか書き換えできません。(なにそれやっすいSDカード?)以上を総合し寿命(経年劣化)と考えました。SMARTの稼働時間がおかしいからファームウェアを更新しようと思いましたがココマデ動いたのでもういいでしょう。', ""Absolutely love it. I have an Acer Aspire V5 that I bought with 500gb of HDD. It wasn't horrendously slow, but I still would have time to go wash my hands or pet my dog for a bit while I turned on my computer. And if I accidentally clicked to open photoshop or itunes? The annoying 45 second wait just to CLOSE the application was getting very annoying.I bought this hoping it would speed up my start-up times and application running and boy does it! Power button to password screen in about 5 seconds. Itunes and photoshop open in about 5 seconds the FIRST time. Once you opened it once, you can close it immediately and if you ever open it again during the time your computer is on, both applications open in a single second. I dont have all the pro-testing skills that everyone else has, but I did do some timing. I extracted 2GB of 4k GoPro footage on my old harddrive which took about 40 minutes. On this, it took about 15. I'd say thats a great improvement. It's also very QUIET! But of course....there are no moving parts.Finally, the file transferring of my old harddrive to this one was fairly simple. I did what everyone else did and had to buy the adapter cable, and then download the software and transfer it. I didnt use the Transcend software, I used Macrium like other people said to, and it was a breeze. No files were lost. Everything copied perfectly. I've had this for about 7 months now and it hasnt lost a beat. Piece of advice to anyone doing this though, DO NOT THROW AWAY YOUR OLD HARD DRIVE. I didn't throw mine away, but I know some people who transferred everything, used a new SSD (not this one in particular), and then tossed their old one. Then their new SSD had a problem, and they got screwed. Always keep your old one just in case. This has been working perfectly for me so I never plan on going back, but I will always keep my old harddrive because you just never know.""]"

Ich denke das ich einen sehr guten Überblick über die Performance verschiedener Systeme, ob Server , Notebooks, normale PC Arbeitsplätze etc. habe und weiß wo diese ihre jeweiligen Stärken / Schwächen besitzen.Eines kann man ganz klar feststellen:Wenn es in der Vergangenheit Performanceprobleme bei PC/MAC basierten Systemen gab, waren diese zu 95% auf die Festplatten zurückzuführen. Oft dann noch in Verbindung mit etwas fehlendem Arbeitsspeicher. Ich versuche diese Zusammenhänge mal hier etwas laienhaft und allgemein verständlich auszudrücken. Es ist nämlich meistens grundsätzlich völlig egal ob eine SSD mal 10 oder 50 Mbytes mehr in der Sekunde schreibt oder liest (Datentransferrate), das merkt man in der realen Nutzung des Gesamtgerätes kaum. Der Unterschied ist es, überhaupt eine SSD einem System zu benutzen. Und diesen Unterschied versuche ich mal hier mal mit einfachen Worten und Zahlenbeispielen zu erklären. Dieses Review ist sehr lang, weil Vieles erklärt wird.Wer sich die Erklärungen sparen möchte und bereits warum und wann eine SSD schneller als eine Festplatte ist, springt am besten direkt ans Ende zum Fazit.Warum wird ein PC durch eine SSD signifikant schneller ?Ein herkömmliches PC/MAC System besteht im Grunde, wenn wir hier zwecks Analyse des Datentransfers und Datenverarbeitung auf die hierfür wichtigen Teile reduzieren, aus nur 3 maßgeblichen Komponenten:1. Dem Prozessor (auch CPU genannt, das Gehirn das die Daten bearbeiten kann)2. Dem Arbeitsspeicher (auch RAM genannt, ist quasi so etwas wie eine Kreidetafel von der die CPU Daten für ihre Datenbearbeitung ablesen kann und auch Ergebnisse aus Teilberechnungen dran schreiben kann um sie kurzfristig verfügbar zu halten)3. Die Festplatte ( auch Harddisk genannt, ist ein Massenspeicher, auf dem endgültige Berechnungsergebnisse, aber auch weitere Massen-Daten wie Photos, Bilder, Programme etc. abgelegt sind, die die CPU gerade halt nicht braucht.Etwas zu den Geschwindigkeitsverhältnissen und den Abhängigkeiten dieser drei Komponenten:- Prozessoren sind schon seit Jahren sehr schnell und verfügen über ebenfalls eigene eingebaute Speicher ähnlich dem RAM, die jedoch verhältnismäßig klein dimensioniert sind und quasi ständig nachgefüttert werden müssen, damit weitergerechnet werden kann. Der in den Prozessoren integrierte Speicher ist vergleichsweise zum RAM Speicher und zum Festplatten Speicher sehr teuer in der Herstellung. Daher wurde dieser meist sehr klein gehalten, außer in extrem teuren Serverprozessoren (bspw. Intel XEON Serie). Zudem können die kleinen Speicher (Caches) in den Prozessoren keine Daten ""behalten"" wenn der PC ausgeschaltet wird. Sie dienen wirklich nur zur direkten Unterstützung des Prozessors und des direkten Rechenprozesses.- Arbeitsspeicher bietet von diesen drei Komponenten die zweit schnellste Speichermöglichkeit und hat sich im Laufe der letzten Jahre durchausin seiner Verarbeitungsgeschwindigkeit entwickelt. Dieser dient jedoch ebenfalls nicht zur finalen Speicherung der Daten oder zur längern Aufbewahrung von Daten, da auch der Arbeitsspeicher nach dem Ausschalten  des PCs ""leer"" ist. Seine Hauptaufgabe ist es möglichst alle Daten die der Prozessor in den nächsten Momenten brauchen könnte vorzuhalten und im richtigen Moment an selbigen auszuliefern. Im Gegenzug werden auch Daten in den Arbeitsspeicher geladen, welche vielleicht in Kürze von anderen PC Komponenten (wie Grafikkarten oder andere Hardware) eventuell kurzfristig gebraucht werden könnten. Auch größere Teilberechnungen die der Prozessor vorgenommen hat und nicht mehr in seinen eigenen kleinen Speichern zwischenablegen kann, werden im RAM temporär platziert.- Die Festplatte, ist das einzige mechanisch arbeitende Element in dieser Dreier Konstellation und auch gleichzeitig das langsamste. Hier befinden sich magnetisch beschreibbare, rotierende Scheiben in einem Gehäuse, auf welchem die gesamten Massendaten des Computers in Form von Nullen und Einsen dauerhaft untergebracht sind. Daten auf einer Festplatte bleiben somit auch beständig erhalten, wenn der PC ausgeschaltet wird. Hier befinden sich alle Daten die der PC nicht ""vergessen"" darf. Das Betriebssystem, Photos, Bilder, Programme etc. etc. Auf den verhältnismäßig  lahmen Festplatten speichert man deswegen die großen Datenmengen, weil es ""billig"" ist. Es gibt kaum eine andere Speichermöglichkeit die so viel Platz zu verhältnismäßig geringen Kosten anbietet und sich eignen würde in einem PC eingesetzt zu werden.Wie spielen also diese Komponenten nun zusammen ?Hier ein typisches Beispiel, das Laden eines Programmes unter Windows :1. Sie klicken mit ihrer Maus auf ein Programmsymbol ums selbiges zu starten.Die Verarbeitung beginnt mit dem Prozessor der ihre Klicks auswertet, weiß welches Programm Sie gestartet haben, aber selber eigentlich erst einmal nichts weiteres für Sie tun kann außer anderen Komponenten den Auftrag zu geben das entsprechende Programm zu besorgen. Dieser Aufrag landet in diesem Fall erst einmal im Arbeitsspeicher, da sich hier so einige Informationen befinden welche Teile des Windows Betriebssystems eigentlich auch noch benötigt werden um ihr gewünschtes Programm auszuführen. Wenn man Glück hat ist diese Windows Komponente aufgrund eines großen Arbeitsspeichers bereits mit geladen worden, wenn man Pech hat kommen diese Komponenten mit auf die Wunschliste zu den einzelnen Dateien des Programms die nachgeladen werden müssen. Ist die Wunschliste fertig gestellt, wird dieser quasi der Festplatte freundlich übergeben, mit der Bitte um ""Anlieferung"" dieser Dateien. Das können im Einzelfall schnell mal ein paar tausend Dateien sein inklusive der Windows Komponenten die da grad benötigt werden. Und da die irgendwo auf irgendwelcher der magnetischen Scheiben der Festplatte gespeichert sind, schaut die erst mal fein in ihrem eigenen Katalog nach wo das Zeug denn alles so steckt. Dann beginnen die Schreib-/Leseköpfe damit den Katalog abzuarbeiten. Da auch die gewünschten Daten meist niemals direkt ""am Stück"" hintereinander zu finden sind, springen die Köpfe also immer hin- und her solange bis alle Daten ausgelesen und an den Auftraggeber Arbeitsspeicher übermittelt wurden.Bis hierhin sind oft schon bereits viele Sekunden vergangen, in der Sie vor dem Rechner sitzen und sich quasi noch nichts gerührt hat.2. Sobald die notwendigen Daten sich im Arbeitsspeicher befinden, kann der Prozessor damit beginnen diese zu bearbeiten und ihr Programm auszuführen. Die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Arbeitsspeicher und CPU ist dabei verhältnismäßig gut und zügig. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt geht also alles relativ flott und sie könnten jetzt meist schon mit ihrem gestarteten Programm arbeiten. Abgesehen natürlich von den Fällen wo sie in ihrem gestarteten Programm bspw. ein Bild laden wollen, oder eine Programmfunktion aufrufen die bis dahin noch nicht mitgeladen wurde. Dann muss die ganze Kette rückwärts mit einer neuen Wunschliste für die lahme Festplatte zurück abgearbeitet werden. Das kann dauern \' gääähn . Bei älteren PC Systemen die schon viele Jahre Windows Updates \'ertragen\' mussten, und deren Hardware scheinbar nicht mehr für die heutige Zeit gebaut scheint, kann das auch schon mal der Zeitpunkt sein um einen frischen Kaffee zu holen.Das was ich hier mal bildlich dargestellt habe, würde ich gerne mal mit ein paar Vergleichszahlen erläutern um die Verhältnismäßigkeit der einzelnen Komponenten untereinander, in Bezug auf Zugriffsgeschwindigkeit und Datentransfer Geschwindigkeit zu beschreiben.Wir lernen hier gerade einen neuen Begriff zusätzlich zur bisher besprochenen \'Datentransfer\' (Lese-/Schreib)-Geschwindigkeit, auch Datendurchsatz genannt: ZugriffsgeschwindigkeitDie Zugriffsgeschwindigkeit gibt an, wie lange ein Speicher braucht bis er mir die ersten von mir angeforderten Daten liefern kann, nachdem ich ihm das Kommando dazu gegeben habe. Manchmal wird die Zugrifffsgeschwindigkeit auch als \'Latenz\' bezeichnet. Es ist also nicht nur wichtig wie schnell ein Speichermedium die Daten rausrücken kann wenn es einmal damit begonnen hat, sondern auch wie lange es dauert bis es beginnt zu liefern. Und hier steckt die Magie einer SSD. Hier die angesprochenen Vergleichszahlen zu den drei Komponenten in Bezug auf ihre Datentransferrate und den Zugriffszeiten:Speicher die sich in der CPU befinden:1st lvl Cache:Datentransfergeschwindigkeit : 38 GByte/s  Zugriffszeit : 1,2 ns2nd lvl Cache:Datentransfergeschwindigkeit : 18 GByte/s  Zugriffszeit : 3,8 nsHauptspeicher (RAM):Datentransfergeschwindigkeit : 7 GByte/s  Zugriffszeit : 72 nsFestplatte (HDD):Datentransfergeschwindigkeit : 90 MByte/s  Zugriffszeit : 7,2 msTechnikaffine Vollprofis mögen mir verzeihen das ich mich hier an Zahlen eines Core2Duo 2,4 GHz, FSB 800, DDR2-800 Systems aus 2011 orientiert habe, welcher sicherlich nicht mehr Stand der Technik ist. Jedoch ist dieses zur Verdeutlichung des SSD Effektes völlig ausreichend und stellt die Verhältnisse immer noch sehr klar dar.Was man an den obigen Daten deutlich sehen kann, ist das die Speicher die sich in der CPU befinden (L1 und L2 Caches) sowohl vom Datentransfer als auch in der Zugriffszeit sehr schnell sind. (Die Einheit ns bei der Zugriffszeit bedeutet hier \'Nanosekunden\'). Man sieht hier zwar das schon eine deutliche Diskrepanz zwischen der Geschwindigkeit des eingebauten Prozessor- Speichers (Cache) und dem Arbeitsspeicher (RAM) besteht ( Zugriffszeit 1,2ns zu 72ns, was fast den Faktor x60 bedeutet), aber es wird immerhin bei Datendurchsatz und der Zugriffsgeschwindigkeit noch mit denselben Einheiten gerechnet. (Gbyte/s = Gigabyte pro Sekunde und ns=Nanosekunden) . Eine Nanosekunde ist der ein milliardste Teil einer Sekunde, also =  0,000000001 Sekunden. Das ist fast genau die Zeit die der L1 Cache im Prozessor braucht um Daten an diesen zu liefern. Bis diese Daten aus dem Arbeitsspeicher gekommen sind dauert es immerhin schon ca. 60 mal länger (72ns). Das ist aber immer noch verdammt schnell. Und jetzt kommt das Problem : Muss ich die Daten von der Festplatte holen, muss ich mit einer Reaktionszeit selbiger von ca. 10 ms (= 10 Millisekunden) leben. Werden wir mit einer ganz anderen Einheit konfrontiert. Hier nochmal untereinander die Nanosekunde und die Millisekunde:0,000000001 (Nanosekunde)0,001 (Millisekunde)Eine Millisekunde ist also 1.000.000 (eine Million) mal langsamer als eine Nanosekunde. Vergleichen wir also mal die 72ns Zugriffsgeschwindigkeit des Arbeitsspeichers mit den 10ms der Festplatte, so erhalten wir einen Faktor von mal 138889 den der Arbeitsspeicher schneller ist im Zugriff auf die Daten als die Festplatte. Wenn Sie 10.000 kleine Dateien aus dem Arbeitsspeicher dem Prozessor zu Verfügung stellen müssten (gerechnet ohne die reine Übertragungszeit der Datenmengen selbst) würde das in Bezug auf eine Zugriffsverzögerung 10.000*0,000000072ns=0,00072 Sekunden dauern. Also immer noch ein \'Sekundenbruchteil\'. Muss eine Festplatte wie im Beispiel diese Daten zusammenkratzen, braucht Sie alleine für das Zusammensuchen (ohne die Daten selber zu liefern) schon 10.000*10ms = 100 Sekunden. Das ist schon ein gewaltiger Unterschied und demonstriert die Verhältnissmäßigkeit in den Zugriffsgeschwindigkeiten zwischen Arbeitsspeicher und Festplatte. Das Laden von 10.000 verschiedenen Dateien von einer Festplatte ist übrigens gar nicht mal so weit hergeholt. Das entspricht bspw. dem typischen Arbeitsaufwand für eine Festplatte beim Laden ihres Betriebssystems, also wenn sie den PC oder MAC hochfahren.Und das was oben beschreiben ist, entspricht nur der Differenz in der Zugriffsgeschwindigkeit. Zudem kommt noch der Performanceunterschied in der eigentlichen Datentransferrate, also wieviel an Daten in einem bestimmten Zeitraum \'rübergeschaufelt\' werden können. Hier ist der Unterschied zwischen Arbeitsspeicher zu Festplatte (7 Gbyte/s zu 90 Mbyte/s) auch noch gewaltig (ca. der Faktor 78) aber nichts im Vergleich zur Differenz der Zugriffszeiten.So und wer es durch das ganze technische Gewusel bis hierhin geschafft hat, erfährt jetzt warum eine SSD den meisten PCs und MACs einen Riesen Performance Vorsprung gibt:Ganz einfach. Wie wir oben herausgefunden haben ist eine Festplatte um ein unglaublich großen Faktor langsamer als das Arbeits-Verhältnis zwischen Arbeitsspeicher und Prozessorspeicher. Die Festplatte ist also der so genannte \'Bottleneck\' (Flaschenhals) welcher immer dann wenn viele einzelne Dateien von ihr angefordert werden den Arbeitsspeicher und den Prozessor \'warten\' lässt. Dieser Fall das 10.000 tausende kleiner Dateien geladen werden, kommt leider jedes Mal vor, alleine wenn Sie ihr Betriebssystem laden, also den PC einschalten. Deswegen dauert das ganze auch Minuten um Minuten. Je mehr Updates ihr PC mittlerweile für sein Betriebssystem bekommen hat, umso mehr verstreuen sich die Dateien auf der Festplatte und umso gewachsener ist die gesamte Anzahl einzelnen kleinen Dateien. Und das \'killt\' über die Jahre fast immer die Gesamtperformance eines Rechners, selbst wenn der zum Kaufzeitpunkt ein \'Höllengerät\' war.Sehr oft werden dann wegen solcher minutenlanger \'Booten des Betriebssystem\' Orgien und einem sich teigig anfühlenden Gesamtverhalten des PCs unter seinem Betriebssystem ganze Rechnersysteme direkt ausgetauscht. Kann man machen. Muss man aber nicht. Sollte man auch nicht, vor allen Dingen wenn das neue PC System nicht über eine SSD verfügt. In diesen Fällen habe ich nämlich schon eindrucksvoll demonstrieren können das der alte mit einer SSD aufgerüstete Rechner bis zu 8 x schneller gebootet hat, als der brandneue Rechner, der aber wieder mit einer normalen (wenn auch schnelleren) Festplatte ausgerüstet war.Warum ist die SSD denn jetzt eigentlich schneller als jede Festplatte ?Weil Sie quasi fast so schnell ist wie ein Arbeitsspeicher (RAM) und keinerlei mechanische Verzögerung hat. D.h. sie ist sowohl im Datentransfer, als auch in der Zugriffsgeschwindigkeit dem normalen Arbeitsspeicher des PC/MAC sehr ähnlich, und kann damit tausendmal effizienter im Team und im Zusammenspiel von Arbeitsspeicher und Prozessor mitwirken. Eine SSD ist ein so genannter \'Flash\' Speicher, was bedeutet das sie ihre Daten nicht wie ein normaler Arbeitsspeicher beim ausschalten des Computers \'verliert\'. Somit eignet Sie sich auch erstmals zum Ersatz einer Festplatte die ihre Daten ja magnetisch (relativ) dauerhaft speichert.Ein simples Rechenbeispiel:Das weiter oben genannte PC System soll \'gebootet\' werden. Das typische Windows besteht aus 2 Gigabyte an Dateien die in den Arbeitsspeicher geladen werden müssen und ca. 10.000 einzelnen Dateien.Für das obige PC System das die Daten von seiner Festplatte laden muss bedeutet dies:Für die reine Zugriffszeit zum Laden der Dateien: 10.000*10ms = 100 Sekunden.Zzgl. der Zeit zum Übertragen der Daten selbst, 2GB / 90Mbyte/s = ca. 22 Sekunden.Also in Summe ca. 122 Sekunden. Mit rund zwei Minuten ein typischer Bootvorgang.Rüsten wir das System jetzt auf eine SSD um, sieht die Rechnung ca. aus wie folgt :(Wir kalkulieren mit einer marktüblichen SSD mit Zugriffszeiten um die 0,1 ms und einer Datentransferrate von ca. 500 Mbyte/s. Der Fairheit halber (ältere PC Systeme können diese hohen Datenraten oft über ihren älteren internen BUS gar nicht abbilden, rechnen wir hier mit 30%,also mit 150 Mbyte/s )). Für die reine Zugriffszeit zum Laden der Dateien: 10.000*0,1ms = 1 Sekunde !!! Zzgl. der Zeit zum Übertragen der Daten selbst, 2GB / 150Mbyte/s = ca. 13 Sekunden. Also in Summe ca. 14 Sekunden. Das entspricht einem typischen Bootvorgang eines Betriebssystems mit SSD.Man erkennt hier deutlich das mit einer SSD das Hauptproblem, nämlich die Zugriffszeiten auf die vielen tausenden Einzeldateien durch den Einsatz einer SSD fast komplett eliminiert wurden. Wer das jetzt bis hierhin verstanden hat, weiß wo die Magie einer SSD liegt, was diese vermag zu leisten, und das es eigentlich fast schnuppe ist, welche Datentransferrate eine SSD letztendlich bietet. Für eine höhere Datentransferrate einer SSD viel Geld auszugeben lohnt sich maximal für ganz neue, hoch performante PCs / MACs mit den entsprechenden Bus Systemen, die diese Daten auch weitertransportieren können.FAZIT:Für ältere PCs sind die SAMSUNG Festplatten mit ihren in Relation zur Konkurrenz gesehenen, mittleren Datentransferraten und ihrem günstigen Preis völlig ausreichend. Zudem verfügen die Samsung SSD standardmäßig über eine mitgelieferte Software, mit deren Hilfe man das Originalbetriebssystem meist bequem von der alten Festplatte auf die SSD übertragen kann. Zudem sind SSDs durch die nicht vorhandene Mechanik im Gegensatz zu Festplatten völlig resistent gegen Schocks (gerade wichtig für den Notebookbetrieb unterwegs) und verbrauchen aus dem selben Grunde auch deutlich weniger Strom.Es gibt viele gute SSDs auf dem Markt von verschiedensten Herstellern, aber in Bezug auf Qualität, Performance, Lieferumfang und Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis kann ich aus vielen Jahren Erfahrung die SAMSUNG SSDs nur empfehlen. Ich habe insgesamt mittlerweile ca. 70-80 SSDs (meist SAMSUNG SSDs aus der EVO Serie) verbaut und hatte mit den SAMSUNGSs niemals Probleme oder Ausfälle.Ich hoffe das ich mit diesem etwas ausschweifenden Review einigen Leuten nahe bringen konnte was überhaupt genau der Vorteil einer SSD ist und wie dieser zu quantifizieren ist.

Mais j’ai été confronté à un problème de taille (c’est le cas de le dire !) : car chaque disque dur a un espace disponible variable, et le backup de mon ancien SSD 512Go ne tenait pas dans mon nouveau disque, qui était pourtant lui aussi un 512Go.J’ai donc opté pour un SSD de capacité supérieure, et je ne regrette pas ce choix. Pour la restauration de l’image système, j’ai utilisé Veritas System Recovery (anciennement Norton Ghost). J’ai bien récupéré ma sauvegarde du 512Go mais, second problème, je me suis retrouvé avec une partition affichant 512Go alors que ce Samsung EVO 870 a une capacité de 1To !A l’aide d’un outil de partionnement, j’ai pu visualiser et déplacer l’espace libre masqué pour qu’il soit contigu à ma partition système. Au final, tout est ok et je dispose maintenant de plus d’espace libre. Cela améliore les performances de mon PC, notamment quand je fais de la retouche photo (sous Photoshop) ou du montage vidéo (sous Premiere Pro).Je suis satisfait des performances de ce disque, l’OS démarre rapidement et ce Samsung EVO 870 supporte évidemment mieux les chocs qu’un disque optique traditionnel. Il m’a coûté 86 euros et je trouve le rapport qualité/prix correct. Néanmoins, les SSD ne sont pas éternels, j’en ai fait la malheureuse expérience à plusieurs reprises et ne saurais que trop vous conseiller de faire des backups réguliers de vos données.Points positifs :+ Bonnes performances+ Supporte les chocs+ Disque compact+ Prix correctPoints négatifs :- Fiabilité relative', 'Vor ca. 3 Jahren habe ich unsere Laptops mit unterschiedlichen SSD aufgerüstet:- eine riesige Intel in dem Toshiba Qosmio mit Intel i-7-Prozessor und 16 GB RAM- eine Samsung 840 PRO mit rd. 500 GB i dem Asus N56V, ebenfalls mit Intel i-7- 2 oder 3 andere Samsung mit 256 GB in einem Medion Akoya und zwei Toshiba Satellite, die wenig benutzt werden.Generell würden die Rechner enorm schnell, so bootet z.B. den Qosmio mit Windows 7 in weniger als 45 Sekunden mit SSD und braucht um 3 Minuten wenn er von der Toshiba 1TB HDD hochfährt.Allerdings hat die sehr teuere Intel SSD nach ca. 2,5 Jahre schlapp gemacht und ich habe sie jetzt durch diese 850 EVO mit rd. 500 GB ersetzt.Auch die Software wie MS Office, Corel Draw oder PaintShop Pro X8 wird ohne Wartezeit geladen. Ohne SSD dauert es bei Corel bis zu fast 10 Sekunden. Man muß natürlich sagen, dass die Toshiba 1 TB HDD nicht die schnellste und daher kein Referenz für einen Vergleich ist.Ähnliche Erfahrungen habe ich mit dem Asus N56V gemacht. Hier erscheint der Windows Desktop mit allen Ikonen nach ca. 15 Sekunden und nach weiteren 10 Sekunden ist alles betriebsbereit.------------------------PRO oder EVODie Samsung PRO läuft jetzt seit ca. 2,5 Jahre täglich absout einwandfrei und die gestrige Prüfung mit der Software Magician zeigte einen guten Zustand. Sie hat auch 10 Jahre Garantie, die halb so teuere EVO dagegen nur halb so lange.Trotzdem habe ich mich beim Ersetzen der defekten Intel SSD im Toshiba Qosmio für die preiswertere Samsung EVO entschieden, weil der Laptop bereits 3 Jahre alt ist und ich brauche keine Festplatte, die garantiert 10 Jahre läuft für den doppelten Preis.---------------------------------------------------SSD EVO mit 500 GB ab 108 Euro, NEBENKOSTENFür diese 850 EVO mit ca. 500 GB habe ich regulär bei Amazon 138 Euro mit Prime Versand ausgegeben.Eigentlich kann man eine SSD selber einbauen und konfigurieren. Man muß aber in der Beschreibung darauf achten, dass die Migrations-Software dabei ist. Bevor ich mich stundenlang Kenntnisse über Bootsektoren und -Software aneigne, die ich nie wieder brauchen werde und Notebooks mit labile Plastik-Abdeckungen auseinander schraube, lasse ich lieber Fachleute ran, die das jeden Tag machen.Den Einbau, die Migration der Software von der klassischen Festplatte und eine komplette Hardware-Reinigung durch einen lokalen Dienstleistler schlagen mit weiteren 80 Euro zu Buche wobei der Laptop Nachmittags abgehohlt und am nächsten Morgen zurückgebracht wurde.Ohne Express-Service kostet diese Leistung inkl. Reinigung i.d.R. um die 60 Euro bzw. um die 50 Euro ohne Reinigung.Ich würde bei der Gelegenheit eine Reinigung für jeden Laptop, der länger als 6 Monaten im Betrieb ist, empfehlen, weil man glaubt es nicht, wieviel Staub ich im Innere ansammelt und die Kühlung beeinträchtigt. .Mein Qosmio hatte sich vor diesen Umbau wegen Überhitzung abgeschaltet.Daher bietet den Einbau einer SSD eine gute Gelegenheit für eine gründliche Reinigung von Innen.---------------------------SELBSTEINBAU ?  WAS BEI EINER NEUINSTALLATION ZU BEACHTEN IST !Eine Festplatte zu ersetzen ist total einfach: Alte rausziehen, neue reinstecken. Das Problem ist eher den Zugang zum Steckplatz, weil manchmal gibt es keinen Deckel sondern das Ganze Gerät auseinander genommen werden muss. In dem Fall würde ich es persönlich nicht riskieren.Bei der Software-Überspielung braucht man eine spezielle Migrations-Software, die nicht immer mitgeliefert wird. Daher Beschreibung sorgfältig lesen.Am einfachsten geht es, wenn man vom Hersteller Installations-DVDs hat und alles auf die SSD neu instaliert.Bei Toshiba kann man z.B. für rd. 30 Euro einen kompletten  DVD-Satz für sein Gerät bestellen. Der hilft auch wenn die Festplatte irgendwann den Geist aufgibt um eine komplette Neuinstallation durchzuführen. Ich habe solche Sätze vorsichtshalber für unsere drei Toshiba im Schrank, nur für den Fall...Auch wenn man sein Laptop verkauft kann man ihn damit im Neuzustand zurück versetzen.Der Einbau einer SSD ist eine gute Gelegenheit eine komplette Software-Reinigung durchzuführen.Mein Qosmio war nach Jahren vollkommen überladen mit Dutzende mehr oder weniger sinnlose Software und das machte sich im täglichen Betrieb negativ bemerkbar.Eine komplette Neuinstallation auf die neue SSD vom DVD-Laufwerk aus ist eine gute Gelegenheit reinen Tisch zu machen und den Rechner zu bereinigen. Danach läuft er erstaunlich flotter und stabiler !Man muß lediglich das Passwort für den W-LAN und die Lizenz-Nr. bereithalten und viel, viel, Zeit ... weil Windows 2-3 Tagelang ständig neu startet und Unmengen Updates herunterlädt und installiert.Auch sollte man vorher möglichst viel Software bei bestehede Internetverbidung desinstallieren.Vieles von Microsoft wie z.B. Publisher darf nur einmal installiert werden und man hat u.U. umsonst bezahlt, da hilft keine Hotline oder e-mail.Das gilt auch z.B. für den BluRay-Player von Mac für Windows oder die Anti-Vren Multi-Lizensen von f-secure, sie müssen erstmal online abemeldet werden, wenn man sie auf die neue SSD-Festplatte erneut verwenden möchte.------------------------------------------------------------------------------DIE GÜNSTIGSTE SSD mit 500 GB FÜR z.Z. 109 EURONun habe ich 2 weiteren SSD Samsung 750 EVO mit 500 GB für 108,69 Euro / Stück als Blitzangebot bestellt um weitere Laptops umzurüsten.Das ist sehr günstig und damit werden die Rechner in etwa doppelt so schnell sein, selbst ein Aldi-Laptop für wenige hundert Euro wird damit richtig flott.------------------------HALTBARKEITNach 2-3 Jahren Erfahrungen mit 4 SSDs erscheinen mir persönlich die Samsung PRO und EVO als zuverlässiger und preiswerter als die teuere Intel. Sie werden auch durch die Fachpresse ebenfalls sehr positiv beurteilt, wobei es ebenfalls andere gute Fabrikate woanders gibt (Sandisk, Toshiba, Crucial, Plextor, Kingston...)Die PRO 500 GB läuft nach über 2 Jahren täglichen Einsatz wie am Ersten Tag.Die EVO auch, aber da die entsprechende Geräte (Medion, Acer, 2 Toshiba Satelitte) viel seltener gebraucht wurden, kann ich das nicht wirklich vergleichen und beurteilen.Fundierte und aktuelle Informationen, Hintergrundwissen, Tests und Tipps findet man z.Z. u.a. bei pcgameshardware.de---------------------------------WELCHE GRÖSSE ?Bei der Grösse habe ich mich prinzipiell auf 500 GB festgelegt, weil die Software (Windows-Betriebssystem, umfangreiche Bildbearbeitung,.Videoschnitt, Office-Paket und ein Dutzend Utilities z.B. um BluRay abzuspielen etc.) zwischen 90 und 140 GB - je nach Laptop und Windows-Version belegen.Dazu sollte man noch reichlich Platz für Wiederherstellung / Sicherungen, Dateien (auch Videos) und Oversizing budgetieren und 256 GB könnte knapp werden..Eigentlich sind 256 GB ausreichend, aber 500 GB-SSDs sind pro GB meistens etwas günstiger, kosten nur ein Paar Scheinschen mehr, sind etwas scheller und bieten massig Reserven. Daher wäre das meine Empfehlung, egal ob der Laptop ein oder zwei Plätze für 2,5-Zoll-Festplatten bietet.-----------------------------PREIS-LEISTUNGDie aktuellen Preisen zwischen 110 und 140 Euro für eine 500GB-SSD finde ich recht akzeptabel, Preise über 400 Euro für eine 1 TB-SSD finde ich abschreckend und absolut nicht notwendig. Mit 500 GB hat man mehr als genug für Betriebssystem, Software, Sicherungen / Wiederherstellung und jede Menge Dateien in der aktuellen Bearbeitung, auch Videos in 4K-Qualität. Alles was fertig ist kann man in kassischen HDD-Festplatten archivieren, 1TB-Grössen kosten inzwischen unter 100 Euro, es macht einfach keinen Sinn schneller und teuerer SSD-Speicher für bereits bearbeiteten Dateien bereitzustellen.Daher stellt die 500 GB-Grösse m.E. das optimale Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis.  Er liegt auch z.Z. (Sommer 2016) bie 28 cents pro GB.Hinzu kommt, dass SSDs ab 500 GB mehr Chips und bessere Controller haben und schneller sind als die kleineren Modellen.-----------------------------------------------PARTITIONIEREN ODER NICHT ?Früher habe ich die SSDs in C: für die Software und D: für die Dateien partitionniert. Das mache ich jetzt nicht mehr, weil das schon eine Einschränkung, z.B. beim Schneiden von grossen Video-Dateien, oder wenn ich verschiedenen Versionen installieren oder testen möchte,  ist.Stattdessen bearbeite ich alles in C: und auslagere die fertige Datei in D: bzw. eine klassische, interne Festplatte mit 1 TB.---------------------------------------------ARBEITSTEILUNG SSD / HDDSchließlich benutze ich neben der Auslagerung auf interne HDDs noch eine kleine Seagate Expansion Portable Drive mit 2 TB als Datensicherung. Diese Festplatte, ist völlig unkompliziert und zuverlässig und enorm preiswert.Mit der Auslagerung auf eine interne HDD und Datensicherung auf eine externe, preiswerte HDD 2 TB ist die bzw. sind die SSDs mit 500 GB ausschliesslich dazu da, das zu tun, was sie am Besten können, nämlich dafür zu sorgen, dass die Rechner optimal und ausserordentlich schnell  arbeiten, und das für eine sehr geringe Investition von knapp über 100 Euro pro Rechner.-------------------FAZITEs gibt verschiedene, aber wenige Möglichkeiten einen Rechner / Notebook zu tunen, z.B. den Arbeitsspeicher zu verdoppeln. Aber keine macht sich so krass bemerkbar wie den Einbau einer SSD als C:-Festplatte. Andere wie den Anschluß eines externen BluRay-Laufwerk mögen noch etwas bringen, aber alles andere wie schnelleren Prozessor (mit Hitzeprobleme), Display, Grafikchip usw. ist praktisch ausgeschlossen.Insofern sehe ich das als die einzige sinnvolle Ausgabe ohne gleich ein neues Gerät anzuschaffen.Ich würde diese SSDs wieder kaufen und einem Freund mit gutem Gewissen empfehlen.', 'Edito: tengo dos y siguen funcionando perfectamente desde hace 3 años!------------------------Lo uso en Mac, con una caja externa que he adquirido de Inatek (poned en el buscador B00DW374W4), la de plástico con el botón on/off. Además, lo hago a través de un Hub USB 3.0 de Aukey (en buscador B00KR2I35A) porque me quedo sin puertos en el Mac. Ideal si trabajas con vídeo y archivos muy pesados.Como podéis ver en la foto que he subido, la velocidad que alcanza en disco externo es fantástica (412 MB/s escritura y 429 MB/s lectura) y Samsung entrega en este modelo 5 años de garantía. Ahora mismo en relación calidad-precio diría que mejora al anterior 840 EVO (con 3 años garantía), ya que el 850 EVO garantiza una vida útil mayor, lo que a la larga es lo que importa sobre todo si le das mucho uso y no quieres irte a un modelo superior (850 PRO).Lo más de lo más ahora es el 960 PRO NVME: http://amzn.to/2DyIwr4', 'Prestazioni aumentate al mio vecchio pc in termini soprattutto di velocità  avvio sistema operativo.', ""I've been using SSDs for years now and once you've used one you can never go back to having a hard drive as your boot drive. I paid £160 for my first SSD which was a 128GB Crucial M4 in October 2011 and since then I've used lots of other SSDs in personal and client builds from SanDisk, OCZ and Samsung mainly. I bought the M4 because at the time it was one of the fastest drives available and crucially it had one of the most stable SATA controllers, which was important at the time because a lot of drives had fairly unstable controllers and often caused a lot of problems such as blue screens of death and system crashes. A few years later and after having used SanDisk and OCZ SSDs, the Samsung SSDs had become extremely popular especially when the 840 was launched in 2013 or 2014. I bought my first Samsung SSD in July 2014 to replace the SSHD that I bought for my ThinkPad which was an 840 EVO 250GB and since then I have only bought and recommended Samsung SSDs. After that I bought an 850 Pro 256GB for a build I did in November 2014, then an 850 EVO 250GB in March 2015 to replace the 128GB OCZ Vertex 4 in my desktop and recently this 850 EVO 500GB to replace that 840 I had in there previously. I used to be very active on an online forum and I've recommended these 850 drives to hundreds of people and I've never had anybody come back and say the drive failed or that they were disappointed with it. The 850 is a truly stellar drive - well-priced, fast and easy to setup. The chances are that you'll buy one Samsung SSD and then only buy them without looking at the other brands.The speed is great. This is probably the fastest SATA SSD on the market, when used on a SATA 6GBps connection you're pretty much guaranteed to get at least 500 MB/s read and write speeds with this drive. These drives were and still are exceptionally popular with members on the forum I used to post on and most people on there were able to get between 500 and 550 MB/s read and writes with these. For comparison's sake, the Crucial M4 I bought in 2011 achieved around 400 MB/s read and write and the OCZ Vertex 4 I purchased in February 2013 when it was the fastest drive available could achieve around 450 MB/s read and write, so for those upgrading from an older SSD this is a little bit faster. Most desktop boards manufactured since 2012 will have SATA 6GBps and most laptops made since 2012 or 13 will also have SATA 6GBps, but even on the older SATA 3GBps connection you're likely to achieve around 250-300 MB/s read and writes which is reasonable.Those upgrading from hard drives will notice a huge difference. A 5400 RPM disk usually found in laptops typically reads and writes between 90 and 110 MB/s and a good 7200 RPM disk typically reads and writes between 120 and 150 MB/s. An SSD like this is the best single upgrade you can do to increase general performance of your system and it's fantastic that these days it can be done quite cheaply - certainly a lot cheaper than it was in 2011 when I first bought an SSD.If you plan to stripe two of these in a RAID-0 configuration you're likely to get around 1GB/s read and write with these drives. Several users on the forum had these in RAID-0 and got these kind of speeds. I've presently got the 250GB 840 EVO and 250GB 850 EVO in a RAID-0 stripe set in my desktop and I get something like 1GB/s read and 990 MB/s write. The 840 and 850 are so similar that you can quite happily stripe them and the two drives typically get 500 MB/s read and write speeds in single drive configurations so you won't be losing performance by doing so. The speed is of course phenomenal but for day-to-day use I can't really see the difference between one and two of these drives, but for things like writing Adobe Media Cache and copying files there is a benefit to using RAID-0 on these drives.Of course, the benefits of this SSD are the same as using any other SSD. Compared to a hard drive everything is instantaneous, everything loads faster and the speed of your OS in general just improves dramatically. You'll never go back! You actually won't be able to, the speed of an HDD will drive you mad if you go back to having an OS installed on your HDD. In a laptop it can improve the battery life too, but I didn't really notice this when I replaced the SSHD in my ThinkPad with the 840. Speaking of SSHDs, if you're thinking about an SSHD instead of a large SSD like this because it's cheaper then think again. I had a 1TB SSHD, of which only 8GB was solid state storage for operating system cache, which meant that the OS would cache files to the 8GB solid state storage so it would boot and shut down quickly. but programs were ran from what was essentially a 5400 RPM HDD and the OS ran as if it were on a 5400 RPM HDD, so the benefits of the SSHD were minimal and it died on me after only a few months, luckily by which point I had replaced it with an SSD. When I bought my 128GB Crucial M4 a 500GB drive like this was way out of most people's reach - it would probably have cost close to £1,000. Even a 256GB SSD was out of most people's price brackets, but now with a 500GB drive costing around £140 and a 250GB drive costing about half that, there's no reason to buy an SSHD really especially if you own a desktop computer and can have a large hard drive to store data on. Even if this is your only drive, 500GB is probably big enough for you. Who really has more than 500GB of data?So, you'll never go back to having a hard drive as your boot drive and you'll also only buy Samsung SSDs after you've bought one."", ""Ho acquistato questo prodotto per sostituire un vecchio hard disk montato su un vecchio PC che avevo in casa per migliorarne le prestazioni. Avevo sentito parlare della velocità delle unità SSD (Solid State Drive), ma non ne avevo ancora provata una. Ho avuto modo di testare questo prodotto dopo averlo fatto montare dal mio tecnico di fiducia sul mio PC. Montato in meno di 10 minuti, il tempo di aspettare l’installazione del sistema operativo, l’ho subito provato. Risultato? Sbalorditivo! Il vecchio PC, che per avviarsi impiegava un bel po' di tempo, con questo SSD è diventato una scheggia.Principali differenze e miglioramenti che ho potuto notare rispetto all’hard disk tradizionale a disco rigido montato sul mio vecchio PC fisso sono:1- Avvio del sistema operativo molto più veloce2- Caricamento delle applicazioni più veloce3- Maggiore velocità di trasferimento dei file, sia nella scrittura che nella lettura, grazie all’interfaccia SATA III4- Maggiore velocità di apertura dei fileTutti gli aspetti sopraelencati migliorano significativamente tutte le prestazioni generali del sistema operativo. Le dimensioni e il formato da 2,5 pollici lo rendono un prodotto compatibile sia per PC fissi che portatili. Le prestazioni sono davvero notevoli, la velocità di lettura può raggiungere i 540 MB/sec, mentre la velocità di scrittura può arrivare a 520 MB/sec.

‎B00OBRE5UE,Samsung 850 EVO 500GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-75E500B/AM),Storage,S$91.90,https://www.amazon.sg/Samsung-2-5-Inch-Internal-MZ-75E500B-AM/dp/B00OBRE5UE/ref=sr_1_644?qid=1695814159&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051%2Cp_n_is-global-store-asin%3A6809457051%2Cp_36%3A5000-30000&rnid=6450031051&s=computers&sr=1-644,https://www.amazon.sg/Samsung-2-5-Inch-Internal-MZ-75E500B-AM/product-reviews/B00OBRE5UE/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,4.8,"[""I have 2 of the Samsung 850 EVO Series drives. The 500GB and the 250GB. I have them under use in both my laptop and desktop. The performance is fantastic, and I got both on sale for an overall excellent value.They are very easy to install. If you are buying for a desktop or laptop make sure you get either a mounting bracket or spacer. Most laptops seem to need a spacer as the SSD's tend to be thinner in profile than a physical spinning disk. For my desktop I purchased the  SABRENT 2.5 to 3.5 Inches Internal Hard Disk Drive Mounting Kit (BK-HDDH) and everything fit as expected, the kit included all the screws. For some the lack of a spacer or mounting bracket being included is a knock down in star, it didn't bother me so no deduction there.The 250GB version was so good it sold me on getting a second one. I bought the 500GB for my desktop.The 250GB boots my Toshiba Satellite S55t up in under 23 seconds from a cold start. At the end of that I am able to login and all the services have been deployed and are running at 100%. So that speed and performance sold me to get the 500GB for my desktop.For the 500GB I installed that to my current desktop and it brought my start-up time down to 45 seconds. The reason for the disparity is in my desktop setup and not the drive itself. I am running 6 devices on my sata controller vs 1 on the laptop so it takes slightly longer to get the desktop up to full song.Now how did it help me in my performance for what I do on my PC. My games load almost instantly, my Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator applications load in seconds now if not instantly and I am deploying them with 3400 fonts installed, that would typically drag performance down, but the SSD chews up that loading and spits out fast responses.Pro's: - Speed (Boots to Win7 64 Pro on my laptop in 23 seconds with no optimization, 45 seconds on my desktop fully optimized) - Cost (I picked up the 500GB for $199, thats the best deal possible for the top performing drive in this category for size and speed) - Easy to install, includes software for disk cloning or data transfer if you choose. I like the Samsung Magician overview software that tells you all you will need to know on how to manage and optimize your drive to get the most from it. - Samsung tech support is great. I called them after purchasing the drive to ask about my Performance test numbers post full reload, see what I could do to better  make use of the drives full capability. The technician was friendly and patient with me, didnt talk down to me and we talked back and forth for a few minutes. Definitely impressed with the support I received.Con's: - No mounting hardware or spacer for a laptop. If you look at Crucial MX series drives you will see they include a thin line spacer to help secure the drive in place by filling that difference of depth that occurs when shifting from a physical spinning platter drive (HDD) to a SSD. Samsung does not include a spacer, or mounting hardware. Again it didn't bother me as I planned to buy a bracket to mount it to my case anyway and already did my research and knew about the lack of mounting hardware. But for some this is a con. So be aware that you will need mounting hardware for a desktop application, and possibly a spacer for your laptop of choice.I have had both the 850 EVO by Samsung and the Crucial MX100 series. If you can get one or the other at the same price get the Samsung, its faster, by only a little but it is the standard setter for its class in SSD technology. If the price goes back up to the $240 mark, then I suggest you look at the Crucial MX series. They are very close in performance and more cost friendly on average.------------------------------------------------Update 10/2/2015In addition to my previous two 850 EVO drives. I have purchased two more 250GB for updates. I used one on my wife's WIN7 college notebook and the other on my mother-in-laws WIN8 desktop. Both run flawless as expected and increase performance and extend the life of the machines they are in. As the price continues to drop on these drives and SSD's in general as in IT technician I can not stress enough how important it is for you to make the leap from standard HDD to a SSD. You will never look back."", 'I\'ve owned Samsung SSDs for years, but this was my first Self Encrypting Drive that I got from them. So I\'m not going to say that upgrading from a spinning HDD to this SSD makes everything load so much better -- for that read other reviews. They are correct. That is true!I will base my review on the claim that this drive supports hardware based encryption, or this line from the Amazon description page, ""AES 256-bit hardware-based, encryption...""I don\'t know if people realize that by enabling full disc encryption on their laptops, and by setting up pre-boot authentication and a user account password they can greatly secure their laptop against theft, which, let\'s face it, is quite prevalent with laptops. I always employed full disk encryption on my computers, which unfortunately always came at a price of a slightly slower drives because of the need for a CPU to encrypt/decrypt all disk operations. But it was worth it!!!So I was very excited to read that this somewhat inexpensive SSD supported ""AES 256-bit hardware-based encryption."" That basically meant no loss in drive speed! So I purchased it...Unfortunately, it turns out that one needs some very specific hardware (besides the SSD itself) to be able to use their mentioned hardware based encryption with Windows, and my (somewhat) older laptop did not quality for such. So I\'m going to name the requirements here, which are omitted from their main ""sales pitch"":- You will need an Enterprise, Ultimate or Pro version of Windows 10, 8.1 or 7. Just a Home version will not work. For some (dumb) reason Microsoft doesn\'t put BitLocker on those systems. (""BitLocker"" is the Microsoft\'s built-in full disk encryption service.) So if you have an OS that doesn\'t support BitLocker, or if you prefer to use an open-source encryption solution, then your only choice is to use software based encryption with VeraCrypt. It\'s a free solution available online. But it is visibly slower than BitLocker.- You will need a newer UEFI (not BIOS) on your computer that supports CSM option, that you will need to disable. (Note that such will probably require reinstallation of Windows, if it was installed on that drive previously.)- Then to enable hardware based encryption you will need to run Samsung Magician (which is quite a buggy piece of software -- see below), to enable encryption and then ""Safely erase"" that SSD.- Only then install Windows and then enable BitLocker that will start using hardware based encryption. (Note that if you just enable BitLocker without doing the steps above, or if you don\'t have all the necessary hardware, it will work as a software based encryption.)Lastly, to check that you have enabled hardware based encryption, start administrative command line (cmd command) and type:manage-bde -status c:then check the line where it says ""Encryption method."" It must have word ""hardware"" in it. If so, you\'re good!And last, keep in mind that hardware based encryption today is prone to many hacker attacks. Watch this YouTube presentation on how easy it is to break into misconfigured self-encrypting drives: (make it into a link. Amazon doesn\'t allow posting URLs)youtube.com -slash- watch?v=dG7RQgBK0ZoSo make sure to follow advice at the end of that video!Lastly, a review of Samsung services and especially their provided software. The bottom line -- I WAS NOT IMPRESSED.First, their data transfer software. I don\'t know who wrote it, but it is awful! My old drive that I was migrating to this new SSD had 50 GB of free space (out of 500GB total.) So when I ran their migration software, that was included on the disk, it said that it couldn\'t start moving the data because it needed more free space on the hard drive. :) How much more? 30 GB more! Which meant that to use their dumb migration software I had to throw out 30 GB of my files! So, no thank you! Instead, I downloaded Macrium Reflect Free software, which did it without such dumb restrictions.Then, that flyout paper with the pictures/explanation of how to transfer data. It shows the cable (see my screenshot) but that cable is not included in the package. Seriously! How can you show it when we don\'t give us a cable?! So be ware of it. That piece of paper is totally useless.Also keep in mind that the drive does not come with any screws or extensions that may be needed to physically mount it inside your computer. In itself it\'s the size of a 2-1/2 inch laptop drive, but be prepared to have spare screws to attach it.Lastly, their Samsung Magician software. Very BUGGY as well! When I was trying to ""safely erase"" this SSD to enable hardware encryption it could not recognize my USB stick to write its bootable software on it. Then when I plugged in another USB stick, it recognized it, but while writing it started giving me weird ""microsoft like"" errors and failed. I eventually had to waste a blank DVD to burn it. So the bottom line, if you do all this prepare to waste a lot of time and get a headache at the end.Then, last thought, their software to safely erase the drive. When I tried to do it and booted from the DVD that I burned, it told me that the drive is in the ""frozen state"" and to unlock it I had to literally disconnect the SATA cable from it while it was still powered up. Do they realize how absurd that statement is for a laptop?! I had a spinning DVD inside that I just booted their dumb software from, so I can\'t just flip it up-side-down to take the SSD out without shattering my DVD drive. Plus, it\'s a LAPTOP PEOPLE, to take the SATA connector out, I have to open the back cover and pull the whole thing out. It doesn\'t just come out one by one!I then typed up an email to Samsung, hoping to get some tech support (I personally HATE calling tech support these days and then end up speaking with some dude in India that reads sentences off the screen in a barely legible English. So done that, and no thank you!) Instead I typed up an email asking to guide me thru and received this response one day later:--------------------------Thank you for contacting Samsung Support regarding your concerns and inquiries. We apologize for any inconvenience this may be causing you. Pleace (sp.) contact 1-800-726-7864 so we can more accurately assist you.--------------------------So I eventually gave up.... Too much headache dealing with Samsung for nothing!', 'My best yet computer InvestmentI have been a fan of Solid State Drives since they first became available some years ago, installing a 32 GB SanDisk as a program drive in a Lenovo R61 (the SSD is long gone but the Lenovo refuses to die and I am on a mission to see how long it will continue to run).My favorite Laptop is a Lenovo X220 that originally came with a Samsung 128 GB SSD and my intention was primarily to increase storage capacity.  From day one the Lenovo has been exceptionally fast with iron-clad stability and reliability.  I considered one of the Crucial SSDs as I used several through the years to replace the original SanDisk in the R61, but given the unfailing speed and reliability of the Samsung I thought I would give the new 850 EVO a try.The start of the journey was troublesome, and it has been a long time since I have encountered such frustration in the installation of a new drive.  I couldn’t get it to work.  I tried Samsung’s migration program numerous times and then resorted to an old stand-by, True Image.  I tried almost every trick I have learned over the last 20 years.  The migrations would report out as successful, but the drive would not boot.  I finally called Samsung Technical Support expecting a 2-week delay but was surprised when I spoke to a very friendly and knowledgeable person after a wait of only several minutes.  What he suggested was something I intrinsically knew, but was in territory I wasn’t especially anxious to enter.  The problem was with this installation of Windows 8.1, not with the drive.To start with, I am a fan of Windows 8.1.  When Microsoft offered version 8 at a ridiculously low introductory price I tried it on an old Laptop – figuring I would get my money’s worth of entertainment from the investment.  The old laptop didn’t meet the minimum requirements for Windows 7 and after getting bored looking up migration information I proceeded with an installation on blind faith.  It worked, and it worked well.  I was astonished.  I then proceeded to convert 5 of my 6 PCs to Windows 8 (the R61 still runs XP as it drives an old set of midi-hardware, and it took way too long to figure out all the hierarchies).  As a free upgrade, Windows 8.1 was yet another successful step for Microsoft.  I have also come to prefer downloads vs. a collection of installation discs that end cluttering up the house.  But then I made my first realization – I could not use my Windows 8 product IDs to get the updated 8.1 files that I needed.  But once I figured out a work around, the repair to my corrupted files only took a few seconds and I got the new drive to boot.To say I am impressed with the new drive is an understatement.  My computer was fast before – capable of thoroughly embarrassing my heavily armored Mac Pro that runs Avid’s ProTools and Media Composer.  I love to push computers - see how far ahead of them I can get before they crash.  Numbers and test results are fun to read but when the time comes I make my decision and hope that what I select provides real-world performance for my investment dollar.  The Samsung exceeds my expectations.  I paid almost $500 for my first 40 MB full-height hard drive.  When you turned on the computer it sounded like the engines starting on a 777: a low pitched whine that grew in intensity – also providing additional warmth on cold winter nights.  Move ahead 20 years and you can buy a 500 GB drive that doesn’t weigh much more than a pack of cigarettes (no I don’t smoke) and is a third the size.  And I could drop it without cracking the tile floor.So in conclusion, I would say the Samsung 850 EVO is probably one of the best computer investments I have ever made.  And how many people would say that a new SSD can genuinely be ‘fun’?  For me, it certainly is.  Now I will see how hard I can push it.', '500 GB SDD Upgrade for MacBook Pro 2011 (Early US), MAC OS 10.11.1 BETA El CapitanI have a 750 GB drive, so I used an inexpensive enclosuer and SuperDuper! free trail to clone the drive into the SSD, and then replaced the original drive on my laptop with the SSD. Booted it and also ran the TRIM command. Yes, in my unscientific performance test, the TRIM command improved boot performance by another 50%. So, if you are thinking about upgrading, please purchase this EVO SSD and skip the extra comments below if you wish.I would not waste too much time on the enclosure if you were upgrading SSD on a laptop for the first time. Find an enclosure within your budget and go with it. I spent $15 dollars on one -- because it has an unrefined USB wire -- the wire came loose while I was cloning my drive after three hours. I needed to start again -- this time I moved my laptop to a spot away from my walk path. My total wait clone time was about 12 hours. This method verifies every single file that it copies. Other reviewers use a standard cloning method where they complete the transfer in under an hour. I did not have time to try the various methods, so I chose to let it cook over night. After cloning software I used (SuperDuper!) copied all files to the SSD, it then configured my SSD into a bootable drive. It is a conceptual cloning method, not a clone that we tech-talk about. I skipped the cloning step initially thinking that I would use Time Machine to perform a backup onto my external USB drive and then I would restore it. Nice thought. Reality said differently. I soon abandoned that idea, so there was a two day delay and extra shipping costs with ordering the enclosure and torx tool. I purchased JACKLY 45-in-1, expecting little but pleasantly surprised on the quality and magnetic tooltip.When you watch the SSD replacement videos, no one had any issue on the screws. I had such an issue after taking the old drive out. The casing on the original drive had one stubborn screw -- I ended up using a plier to unscrew it -- it was far easier than you would think. It was much easier than forcing the issue with the torx screwdriver.For all the performance conscious users, I recommend that you purchase this SSD and then run the TRIM command if you are running MAC OS Yosemite or MAC OS El Capitan. (It is a one liner ""trim force"" user friendly command. Please skip it if the commands look ugly.)  I could only confirm that the trim command runs without any issues on the terminal window on Mac OS El Capitan 10.11.1 BETA. I read a few comments about whether or not it really increases performance. My unscientific answer is YES, but I also disabled a resource hungry app on startup. I know so because my laptop fan goes wild on reboot or power up. Please note again. This is unscientific: TRIM increased reboot performance by 50%. (I measured the time in seconds with a digital timer.) I have not read through all the comments about TRIM, so I will defer this observation to anyone who has done a lot of research.The Samsung 850 EVO 500 GB has run without a glitch for over two days now. And my laptop is now my preferred machine. My laptop fan headache has disappeared also. I only purchased this drive for performance. Quietness is an added bonus.One last thing when you try to remove the original drive, you really only need to loosen two screws on a black bar holding the drive in place on your laptop. The correct bar is away from the side of the laptop (inside). This is a little detail I hope might help someone upgrading their laptop for the first time. If you know how to take more precautions about protecting yourself, even better. I simply shut down everything and try not to unscrew or screw too hard.', 'OK, my old Dell Inspiron 1318 laptop was starting to behave a little hinky, you know; not booting with any kind of speed ... if at all, displaying blue-screen messages ... making scary noises ... stuff like that.  Fortunately, I have a friend who\'s a first-rate computer tech, whom I annoy way too much texting long explanations how my computer is suffering, and he stops my nattering with a one-line solution, ""You need a new hard-drive"", then adds a link ... in this case, the Samsung 850 EVO 500GB 2.5"" SATA III.  I, of course, haven\'t a clue, but have learned (over the years), to just follow along ... and not ask any questions.  Predictably, however, I do express my fears of embarking on such a major project, such as replacing my HD.  It\'s a big investment, and (based on my history), just know I\'m going to \'screw\' it up.  My computer buddy assures me it\'s a simple procedure, and within my capabilities.  ""Get the HD, and I\'ll walk you through it,"" says he.So, I place the order, and start checking YouTube videos on the procedure.  After a couple of sleepless nights, the unit arrives (via Amazon Prime).  I open the box, and tell my buddy it comes with an install disk, and instructions.  He says, ""better to use the free Macrium Reflect install software instead,"" and txt\'s me the link, which I install.  The Macrium SW is my worst kind of nightmare, with all kinds of options, tabs, and advanced settings to monkey with ... way out of my wheelhouse.  So, I txt my buddy in panic mode, and tell him I want to (at least) install the Samsung SW to compare.  Thankfully, he says, ""go ahead"".  The Samsung SW is scary simple, with simple instructions; close out of all programs, connect new HD with SATA cable http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HJZJI84?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00, (which is not included with the HD, and costs about $14), and click \'Clone HD\'.  The warning message appears, ""Don\'t Touch Nothing ... and Wait For The DL to Complete.""  So, I walk away, and watch the movie Nightcrawler, with Jake Gyllenhaal, which is a pretty good movie.  I return to the computer, and see it\'s 57% complete.  Progress!  Time enough to watch another movie, so I watch the first of The Worricker Triology, which is also good.  Back to the computer, and it\'s done.As per instructions, I shut the computer down, disconnect the new HD, flip the computer over, remove the battery, remove the old HD (sweating profusely), slip the new HD into the slot ... note: it\'s not a perfect fit being a little thinner then the old HD, so you have to sort-of guide it toward the top of the compartment for it to make contact ... then re-screw the new HD into place, re-insert the battery, flip the computer back over, re-connect the power cord ... then ... re-start the computer.  Which, I was too scared to do, and in total panic mode ... sweating.  So, I txt my buddy explaining it\'s done, but I\'m too scared to turn it on.  He understands me well, and after a few calming words, assure me the worst that can happen is the computer explodes in a fiery blaze.  After I come to accept that, I hit the start button ...As if by magic, the thing starts right up, and I\'m back in business.  It\'s been a few days now working with my new HD, and I must say I am pleased.  Based on all the user reviews, I expected the computer to run 10X faster, but in reality, it\'s more like 3 or 4X faster, but trouble free, which is the best news.  And the moral of the story:  It pays to be a really nervous person, and have a computer guru-friend to call upon.', ""I only review a product when I have something great to say about it. About myself; My day job is an assistant Mix Engineer in Burbank. I use Apple products 15 hours a day 5-6 days a week and have used macs since middle school. I understand that if you care for and maintain a great computer; like any vehicle will last you a long time. That being said my laptop (2010 MPB) with a 7200 rpm HDD was starting to show its age. I was contemplating a new MBP or pro and I figured I would try a 150 dollar upgrade vs. a 2800 spending spree. I couldn't be happier that i did!!I received this next day shipping for 4 dollars extra. My experience as follows;I unboxed it and at first realized just how lightweight these drives are... this SSD must weigh less than half of what a 2.5in. HDD weighs it would be replacing, yet still didn't feel any more fragile. Had a spare cable laying around from an old external drive SATA-USB and plugged in to format it...It wouldn't read the drive lol... starting to get worried I did what i figured to be the last best option, turning my computer off, pulling the old drive and sticking this unformatted one in... put the cover back on without the screws, inserted my usb mavericks install drive instructions found here:http://www.macworld.com/article/2056561/how-to-make-a-bootable-mavericks-install-drive.htmland turned on the machine holding down Command-R I believe and opened up disk utility. Erasing and reformatting the Samsung renaming it, using mac OS X Extended Journal, and GUID partition in options. It took about 5 seconds to do that.From there it was easy to install mavericks once that was done, I ran through the initial mac setup and it asked me if i wanted to use my old drive to transfer all my data basically cloning my old drive, i clicked this option and copying the 100gb took less than an hour with the same SATA-USB connector (same one that would not read the SSD). Once finished it was as if my MBP was brand new!!! it boots in 30 seconds. Runs incredibly quick, can process at Least 30% more data without the fans kicking on... iPhoto runs like a champ and in the background while online or other programs.... It NEVER did that before not even when new... (i've replaced HDD's a few times without any increase in performance) This Thing Kicks Major behind and doesn't break a sweat... the Kicker was when i started up Avid's cpu sucking beast of a program ProTools and ran sessions flawlessly in addition just to try it, I added more processing in the program than it could handle before and all without any problems not crashing the program (which is normal under heavy load) never imagined one simple upgrade could do so much... it will add at least 2 years to the lifespan of this machine and when I'm done with it, Ill give it to my parents and they'll get another 4-5 out of it just surfing the web, facebooking, youtubing etc..One thing to mention is because apple only supports the TRIM function on THEIR SSDs use a third party TRIM support application such as the great pay what you want; Chameleon SSD optimizer. its a great product please throw a few bucks there way! People deserve to be rewarded for the work they do to help others. You will definitely help your SSD last longer with it!That being said overall; It took 2 hours total to install this, help my gf decorate the christmas tree, and eat chicken noodle soup. So I give this product a 5 star review and would probably give it more stars if they'd let me. I hope this review helps you get up and running with your new SSD!Happy Holidays!!"", 'bueno muy bueno', ""My Mother in Law had been given a HP Pavilion Entertainment Laptop (See Specs below) which at this point could not be powered on since it was missing the original AC Cord that had come with it so she gave it to me to see if I wanted to use it as parts. Since I myself already owned a newer and more advance version of the HP Entertainment Series of Laptops and I knew how rugged and reliable they were so I found a generic AC Adapter through Amazon that was only 7 bucks and decided to gamble to see it would still power up, needless to say it did. While the Laptop worked it was almost virtually unusable due to the tortoise 300GB WD Mechanical Drive that had originally come with it. At the time I had researched this SSD (Almost a year ago, yes it took me that long to do this review) it was actually at a good price and the reputation for Samsung EVO Series SSD's are stellar so I made the purchase. Once it arrived It was easy to install the SSD (Since this is an older Laptop the Hard Drive Bays are easily accessible unlike the newer ones that are out today) and was up & installing the OS in no time. Needless to say the results was beyond my wildest dreams.Now Mind you this Laptop was Originally Loaded with Widows Vista Home Premium which goes without saying was no longer an option so I loaded it with Windows 10 Pro (I was already going with a Plan B of Windows 7 if this had not worked) and not only did this work but once again exceeded my expectations.PROS:- Surprisingly Overall Performance Improvement (especially on this old of Laptop)- Booting from BIOS to OS maybe 10 to 12 seconds (3 to 4 minutes with the mechanical original drive)- Application Response times are instantaneous- Able to upgrade from Windows Vista/7 to Windows 10, No performance degradation. (Please Note: I loaded the laptop with Windows 7 straight from the Installation Media and then successfully upgraded it from Windows 7 to Windows 10 since there is no upgrade path to Windows 10 with Windows Vista)CONS:- Absolutely NONE!Overall: I could not be happier, Not only did this drive give a new lease on life on this laptop but the SSD allowed me to successfully upgrade it to Windows 10. I would Highly recommend the SSD Hard Drive not only if your original hard drive was in the condition that this laptop was in but in general for overall performance improvement. As of right now I have been using this Laptop as a backup utility Laptop around the house and has been serving me well.SPECS:HP Pavilion dv6700 (2007)OS: Windows 10 Pro (Originally Windows Vista Home Premium)CPU: Intel Duo Core (1.83 ghz)RAM: 4GB (Max capacity, originally 3GB)Hard Drive: Samsung 850 EVO 500GB SSD (Originally Western Digital 300GB Mechanical HD)Video Card: Integrated Intel Mobile 965 Video Card (VGA output)Ports: 3 X USB 2.0Internal Nic: 100mb Realtek RTL8101E Family PCI-E Fast Ethernet NICWiFi Nic: Broadcom 802.11g Network Adapter (Broken)/LB1 AC600 Dual Band USB DongleROM: DVD/CD WriterWebcam: Integrated 720p Webcam"", 'I installed this in my wife\'s MacBook Pro (mid 2012; non-retina; MacBookPro 9,2) and the installation process could not be more of a breeze. Once the new drive was in, I did a fresh install of OS X 10.10 from USB stick. Then restored user accounts, apps, etc, from the HD just removed from the Mac, attached with this cable: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HJZJI84/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  (rather than using time machine backup). Since I was already opening the computer, I also upgraded the memory to 8 GB using this \'kit:\' http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LDLVAO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1. Once the OS was installed and all data transferred, the difference in boot time, application launch time, and overall performance was nothing short of dramatic. MS Word now opens instantaneously. Night and day. I\'m sure extra memory is not hurting, either, with things like running multiple apps at the same time and application switching. After the upgrade, it feels like a brand new computer. I was originally waiting to upgrade the 500 GB hard drive that come with the Mac once prices of SSD drop enough to make a 1TB a bit more economical, but I\'m really glad I did not wait. The expected longevity/endurance of Samsung\'s ""3D"" technology along with the price point of just just over $200 (with tax) were the 2 key deciding factors (expected performacne gains being a given). Could not be happier. Will be interesting to see if there is any noticeable improvement in battery life and how the drive performs after a year or so (given TRIM is not permitted by Apple on third-party SSDs). BTW - the drive itself looks really good. I realize the case is superfluous and rather irrelevant in an internal SSD (it will never be seen again after re-inserting the back cover), but once installed amid the tidy MacBook innards, the drive looks perfectly at home, actually matching the other components in terms of aesthetics. NOTE: once your drive is installed and configured in your Mac, restart holding option command r p to make your computer stop looking for the old boot drive and start up right away (google \'option command r p\' for details). From pressing the start button to fully loaded desktop, this PowerBook now takes just under 20 seconds.', ""I have a Macbook Pro mid 2010.

At the time I purchased it, I paid $87.99 and I see it\'s at $96.00 today so it means they must\'ve had an increase in sales...or something, not sure how the price fluctuations work. Anyway, This drive does not come with any cabling. The package only brings the CD including the Samsung Magician (drive tests and optimizations after install) and the Data Migration (cloning). I was adding this SSD to my HP Envy 17 m-j1020x which has an extra slot for a 2nd drive. That was a relief to see the first time I opened it because I did not want to lose the 1TB space I had even though that hard drive was painfully slow. The drive fits loosely on the extra slot and I noticed the original drive had a rubber outline which took care of the extra space and gave the drive a tight fit. I started looking for something similar to buy for my new SSD but I couldn\'t see these ""rubber rails"" ANYWHERE! until I YouTubed how to add a 2nd drive to my specific laptop model and an actual video existed from a website: www.newmodeus.com/. the video had a direct link to buy a kit which included the rubber rails and the SATA cable with the exact length needed from the 2nd drive slot to the 2nd SATA connector. It was a blessing!After installing the drive and booting up the computer, it did not show up anywhere at first. I gave it a second reboot and I could see it in Disk Management. Check. I had read a few things about cloning your OS from the old hard drive to the new SSD and basically you have to shrink your OS volume with any programs you\'d like to keep on the SSD to be less than the size of the SSD. So I did that, moving all my media (Pictures, Videos, Music) to my backup drive temporarily. the new size of the volume was about 92 GB, which included everything except my media (Programs and OS files). I also had to account for about 25 GB for the recovery partition, so in total I was looking at ~117 GB to copy to the SSD from my old drive.The Data Migration software that came with the drive is a big disappointment. I had read mixed reviews about it, mostly bad, but was hoping it would go well for me just to make things easier. Well it never got close to working. There was barely any chance to customize the cloning and it kept listing the SSD\'s name as the source even though it displayed the size of my 1TB HDD. Every time I would try to start the cloning, it would say that the source disk had been disconnected 5 seconds after clicking ""Start"". A co worker had previously mentioned Acronis for drive/OS cloning and I had also seen some good things about it online. So I purchased a copy for $50 from their site. Totally worth it! Setting up the cloning was a breeze, plus it gave me options to customize every aspect of it. This software also has many other great features like backup which I have not yet had the chance to experiment with but I am definitely looking forward to, so I highly recommend it.After setting up the options for the cloning, I clicked on start and asked me to restart. After booting up, it booted to Acronis\' cloning screen, since it obviously can\'t clone the drive while you\'re running the OS. The process took a little bit less than an hour. The computer booted again and was still booting to the old HDD but I noticed I could see the SSD clone of my C: drive and the recovery partition. Now I needed to figure out how to tell Windows 10 where to boot from, which isn\'t as easy as in previous versions. I have yet to see an option to boot up to the BIOS or other pre-OS settings. Windows 10 has a setting that lets you choose where to boot from, whether HDD/SSD, USB drive, or CD. When you ask it to let you pick it does a reboot, then a menu comes up with the mentioned options. I chose HDD/SSD but it didn\'t let me pick which one!! DOH! so it booted up again to my painfully slow HDD. I turned it off again, opened up the back of the laptop, disconnected the HDD and booted.....WOILA! it booted so fast to the SSD that I was a little dizzy haha. Seriously, it was incredibly fast. I signed in and that also was ridiculously fast. The OS was ready to go within a second of signing in, with everything loaded. I checked the drives and the new partitions were there, beautifully set up as C: and D: for OS/Programs and Recovery partitions. I turned it off, plugged back the HDD, and booted...incredibly fast again. I knew my SSD had stayed as the new permanent boot drive at that point. Signed in and I saw my old partitions there as F: and J: which were the names I had given to the SSD partitions originally. So the letter switching happened all on its own, which I was kind of stressing doing myself.So that\'s it! I tested opening up things and man.....what a freaking difference. This is the best upgrade you can give your PC if you have a slow HDD, 5400 rpm in my case. But honestly, it\'ll be a 200x difference even with a 7200 or 10000 rpm HDD. Amazing. I currently have 8 GB of memory and plan to take it to the 16 GB max in the next couple of months, but I am good to go with this beauty for now.Hope this was helpful.', 'Just got this and so far it has been as good as advertised.  I have a new Toshiba Satellite P75-A7200 which has 2 on-board drive bays.  It came with a 750 Gig HDD.  It also has 4 RAM slots and can take up to 32 Gigs of RAM.  I\'m using 24 Gigs of RAM now and I recommend upgrading your RAM first and then getting a new Samsung SSD drive.  It makes the cloning or migration go much faster.So I opened up my Toshiba underneath and inserted the SSD into drive bay #2.  Booted laptop back up.  The drive comes with a CD which has the Samsung migration software on it.  Install the software and it will recognize your main drive and your new SSD drive.  I ran the software and it took just 35 minutes to clone my original hard drive to the new SSD.  That was about 116 Gigs of data total.  If I hadn\'t put 24 Gigs of RAM in the laptop first then I think it may have taken about 90 minutes to migrate everything.Once cloning was complete, shut laptop down unplug everything (remove battery as well) and move the new SSD from bay #2 to bay #1.  I put my old drive aside and did not install it in bay #2 yet.  Put laptop back together and booted it up with the new SSD.Super fast!  My laptop boot time went from about 30 seconds to 6 seconds.  Reboot time went from about 50 seconds to about 18 to 20 seconds!The O/S and all applications are blazing fast now compared to the regular HDD with just 8 Gigs of RAM.  Upgrading to 24 Gigs of RAM also was a big plus for running multiple apps at the same time.  My laptop runs much faster, much quieter, and much cooler while producing less heat out of the fan on the side.After playing around with things a while to test out the new drive to make sure everything migrated properly and it was running properly, I then shut everything down (shutdown time is now just 5 seconds also).  Flipped laptop over, opened it up again and I re-installed my original 750 Gig HDD into drive bay #2.Put back together again and booted it up.  My system now recognizes both drives.  C: drive is now the Samsung SSD Evo 850 with 250 Gigs.  And now my original 750 Gig HDD is recognized as drive E:Opened up 2 sessions of Windows Explorer side by side and started comparing all files and folders between both drives.  Identical.  I deleted all big music and video files, etc. from the new SSD so that it\'s as clean as possible with mainly just the O/S Windows 8.1 Pro and my applications.Everything else is still stored on the original HDD since it has 750 Gigs of space on it.I was initially weary of trying to do this upgrade because I read so much online about people having all kinds of errors and other issues getting the migration software to work or getting their PC\'s to boot up in the correct order, or having to make a bunch of BIOS settings changes.Maybe I got lucky, because this whole upgrade process barely took 90 minutes with testing everything out.I did not have to make any boot or BIOS or any other system changes at all for that matter.  I did not run into any errors.  The migration software from Samsung worked perfectly the first try.  So far this whole upgrade has gone flawlessly, so maybe I got lucky compared to others I read about.So if you want a blazing SSD as a primary O/S and application drive, I\'d say this is definitely the one to go with.  The speed boost is awesome, and of course you just get more reliability and safety with SSD compared to HDD which has moving parts and will break down much quicker over time.  Your laptop or PC will last longer too as it will produce less heat and the fan won\'t have to run as much.If you have a laptop with 2 drive bays then this is the way to go while using another drive in bay #2 as a storage drive.Oh...and copy speed between the drives is also blazing fast.  Having 24 Gigs of RAM helps as well.  So you can copy a few big movie files from drive 2 over to drive 1 to play in no time at all.  I\'d rather play them on the SSD so that my HDD isn\'t spinning and making noise and heat, etc.  Then you can just delete the movie files from the SSD when done so that you don\'t take up much room on it.My Toshiba Satellite P75-A7200: 17.3"" 1080p, i7 Quad-Core, Win 8.1 Pro, 24GB RAM, SSD 250GB primary, HDD 750GB back-up', ""How to install it, here's how...The new SSD replaced the HDD in my laptop, which now boots up 5 times faster. It's a powerful gaming computer and some games which take 3 minutes to load now do it 5 times faster! Love this SSD!I am here cutting and pasting some info from Avsim forum (a flight simulator forum) which helped me:I'm posting this so a forum search by someone may help them install a SSD in their system.Having changed my Windows system and FSX installations from HDD to SSD the speed increase is tremendous in: 1) system reboot and 2) booting up a new flight in new location with heavy scenery.Here's the web place that goes through how to do the HDD to SSD upgrade painlessly:How to Migrate Your Windows Installation to a Solid-State Drive by Matt KleinGoogle Search the line above, Amazon does not allow direct links in reviews.====================First, make a Windows recovery drive (takes 3 or 4 minutes):Windows recovery drive: you will need a dedicated USB thumb drive to make it. I needed one badly it turned out and had one all ready. So buy a cheap USB thumb drive (any size) when you buy the SSD.1) First boot the system into BIOS and make sure the system boot choices include a USB drive and the computers hard drive. You need to make sure the system will boot from a USB drive or you can't use the recovery drive which is on the USB thumbstick.2) To make the recovery drive follow the links from Klein's article above to do that. Different links for Windows 7, 8, and 10 in his article.==================================I had the following 3 problems not mentioned there, here's how they were solved (thanks to Samsung online chat tech help).The new SSD did not show up in Windows explorer:There were two reasons for this:1) I had the SSD plugged into a USB3 port, it turns out a new SSD often needs a USB2 port. (For a similar reason that when booting up to BIOS, instead Windows, you may need to use an USB2 port for the mouse or keyboard, not USB3, or BIOS might not see it).2) The new SSD was not initialized in Windows Disk Management. Some SSD's do not require this, mine did (Samsung EVO850 SSD). Otherwise Windows and the computer will not see the new SSD drive.In order to initialize the new SSD disc you run diskmgmt.mscWindows 8.1: type WindowsKey + R or from the desktop open the Start button and type in diskmgmt.mscWindows 10: simply right click the start button and Disk Management is a shortcut to chooseClick open diskmgmt.mscthe new SSD drive icon is going to say unallocated, Now you right click on it and select, “new simple volume”.This basically takes you through a Windows wizard which prompts to format the unit properly to get the drive recognizing in windows explorer and disk management properly as a healthy partition. This is the initialization process and only takes a minute to do.3) After following all the steps on Kleins page to clone the HDD image to the SSD, I removed the HDD from laptop and plugged in the new SSD there. The system would not boot ! :(Here's where the Windows recovery drive (on the USB thumbstick) saved the day. Just turn off the laptop with its power button, insert USB thumbstick you made the recovery drive on and boot. There will now be listed choices from what to boot Windows from: A USB drive, the new SSD, and maybe other choices. Choose the new SSD drive and Windows booted up fine.From then on, the recovery drive thumbstick will not be needed to use the computer, but keep it in a safe place, and label it for what it is. No other files should ever be added onto that thumbstick."", 'Overall good speed for SSD , for faster performance try NVMe', 'Ca avfsit mon affaire', ""Out of obsession, I've run 2 tests on the new 250 GB 850 EVO and the old 120 GB 840 EVO. 2 benchmarks used: Crystal disk mark and HD tune. Below are the results:+++ Crystal disk mark - 840 EVO 120 GB  * seq q 32 red/write: 547/518  * 4k d32 read/write:  213/116  * seq read/write:  521/502  * 4K read/write:  31/60+++ Crystal disk mark - 850 EVO 250 GB  * seq q 32 red/write: 543/534  * 4k d32 read/write:  200/180  * seq read/write:  520/478  * 4K read/write:  35/66Not a big difference, right?  Except for the relatively irrelevant in home applications 4K depth 32 queue write, all the values are within the error margin. Which is pretty big, by the way. Running the test multiple times on the same SSD produces numbers up to +-10% different.Now for HD Tune benchmark. Here I could only use 2 tests: sequential read, and random read. For write tests the SSD has to be wiped out.Results:+++ HD Tune results - 840 EVO 120 GB  * Sequential read  * 154 avg, fluctuates between 32-380.  * long sequences of ~60mb, then long sequences of ~330mb.  * access time: 0.17 ms  * Random read  *  4 KB 5800 IOPS, 0.18ms lat avg, 21 MB/s  * 64 KB  730 IOPS, 1.37ms lat avg, 45 MB/s  *  1 MB  80 IOPS, 12.5ms lat avg, 80 MB/s  * 53 ms max access time!  * That's terrible and much sower than what crystal mark shows!!!  * 4K read is just 21 MB/s, not 60 as in crystal mark!+++ HD Tune results - 850 EVO 250 GB  * Sequential read  * 380 MB/s avg, fluctuates between 368-410.  * access time: 0.08 ms  * Random read  *  4 KB 12800 IOPS, 0.078ms lat avg,  50 MB/s  * 64 KB  4800 IOPS, 0.208ms lat avg, 300 MB/s  *  1 MB  492 IOPS, 2.030ms lat avg, 492 MB/s, 3.38 ms max access time  * 3.38 ms max access time!*850 EVO is vs 840 EVO*  * 2.5x faster in sequential read  * 2.4x faster in 4K random read  * 6x faster in 64K random read  * 6x faster in 1MB random read  * way more constant across all speeds and latencies:  * 11x better worst case sequential speed  * 15x better worst case latency in 1MB read sequencesPretty shocking, isn't it? No numbers available on the net show so big differences. Repeated the tests multiple times on both SSDs, got pretty small variations.Conclusions:  - 850 EVO beats the crap out of 840 EVO. Newer 3D NAND in 850 memory not only improves endurance, but far outperforms the old planar 19 nm TLC NAND in 840 EVO.  - Most SSD benchmarks are crap. Just check the results available on the net. I tend to believe HD tune results are trustworthy. At least because tests take longer on HD Tune, so there's less chance of them being limited by interface transfer speed rather than actual SSD speed.  Maybe someone has an explanation?"", ""I changed to this SSD from a regular HDD because after about 4.5 years the Windows 7 boot time for my desktop had gotten as long as 10 minutes to be completely finished. A clean install of Windows 7 on this drive boots in about 15 seconds from the time I push the power button to a working desktop. Shut down takes about 6 seconds. Most programs open almost instantly.I did hours of research online about SSD technology, manufacturers and the best rated drives. The Samsung 850 EVO is consistently rated at the top, with the premium price paid for the bleeding edge absolute best not worth the minor increase in performance that most users would not notice.I am using this for the C drive of my computer with a one terabyte WD Blue HDD for storage as the D drive. The operating system and programs are on this drive and I moved the Libraries to the D drive so all documents, photos, etc. go to the storage drive by default. This is very simple to do in Windows 7 and appears seamless to the user. You still go to the same places to save and retrieve files; they appear to be stored exactly as if you had one drive with everything on it. In my case this leaves well over 120 GB free on the SSD after Windows and all programs are installed.My motherboard is from 2011 and uses the H67 chipset. This drive was recognized the same as any HDD would be with no further steps required in the Bios or Windows. Depending on the age and brand of your particular hardware you may need to change certain Bios settings to get the drive to work at its best. Windows settings may also need changed if you are cloning a working operating system from a HDD.The drive runs fairly cool and is silent. I did not have an adapter to secure it to the drive bay of my case, so I used two zip ties to fasten it to the chassis so it doesn't flop around, which could theoretically work loose the SATA and power connections.My son got one of these drives for his new laptop. After initializing Windows 8.1 on the laptop, we cloned the HDD to this SSD drive using Macrium Reflect and a USB 3 drive enclosure. We then removed the HDD and installed this SSD, which took about five minutes. After installing this drive his laptop boots to a working desktop in about 7 seconds and shuts down in about 4 seconds. Programs open instantly. Loading all the updates and installing the rest of the programs went about twice as fast as the last time we did the same thing using a regular HDD on an almost identical laptop. There is a minor decrease in weight and apparent increase in battery life over the manufacturer spec. The result is a mid level laptop made as fast as a top end machine for about $400 less.250 GB is enough storage for most laptops, but if more is needed you could use a flush fit USB 3 flash drive or an SDHC card in the internal card reader that is part of most laptops. SDHC cards are available up to 128 GB right now. Along those lines, my son is buying a $20 USB 3 drive enclosure and making a one terabyte external storage drive out of the perfectly serviceable (if relatively slow) HDD that had been installed in the laptop."", ""I purchased a laptop, an HP 8460p, which included a 500GB HDD. I wanted to upgrade to a new SSD. I chose the Samsung 850 EVO 250GB, as I don't really install very many programs.  This drive is lightning fast! Even though I initially had only Windows 7 pro installed and no other programs, it was literally 20-30 seconds from the time I pressed the power button to the time Windows was finished loading! I highly recommend this drive! No problems from instalation of the physical drive into the laptop or from Windows finding it and installing the necessary drivers. That's what we all want: a simple, easy installation with no problems!  Unfortunately, the cloning software included with this drive gave me some problems. First, the included cloning software could not replicate my Recovery Partition. Even the Samsung Help files within the software stated this was a possibility. It was in my case. In fact, my Recovery Partition is formatted FAT32 and Samsung's software formatted it to NTFS automatically during the cloning process. Second, the only drives and partition I had on my HDD was the Windows C: (over 400 GB), the Recovery D: (6 GB), and the hidden Windows Partition (also 6 GB). Samsung's cloning software messed up ALL drive and partition sizes, badly! And there was NO option to resize them before cloning! The new SSD would have had a 90 GB C:, a 60 GB Recovery D:, a 60 GB Windows hidden partition, and the leftover space was Unallocated! Sorry! Can't have that! So I had no choice but to look for an alternative cloning software, hopefully something that will replicate my Reovery Partition, the CORRECT drive and partition sizes, and get it right the first time. And I want to stress again, I was going from a 500 GB HDD to a 250 GB SSD, so I needed this new program to compensate for this difference. Luckally, I found such a program....and it was FREE!  The program I used was called AOMEI Backupper Standard FREE! Not only did it sucessfully replicate my Recovery partition so I could boot into it, but this software also gave me the option to MANUALLY move(!) and resize(!) my drives and partitons before cloning! In fact, I had a small 100 MB Unallocated space. I moved this space to the end of my C:, then I could click on my C: and extend it, making this unallocated space part of my C:! It gets better! This program, while cloning, compensated for the differences in disc sizes, and shrunk the sizes of each drive and partition without affecting the files on those drives and partitions! It took maybe 40 minutes to clone the HDD. After I installed the new SSD into my laptop, I booted it up into both Windows and my Recovery mode. Then I checked the layout of the drive in Windows Disk manager. Everything looked just the way it should, and the way I wanted it to! I hope someone else who wants to retain the data integrity of their System Recovery partition and proper drive and partition sizes will benefit from using AOMEI Backupper Standard in case the cloning software included with their Samsung SSD doesn't work for them. So in the end, I am very pleased with my overall experience of cloning to and using my new Samsung 850 EVO 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD!"", 'My review will be split up into two portions:  The SSD hardware and the Samsung software.SSD HardwarePros-Easy to mount into my case.  Connections were firm and the product itself is built well.-Recognized by Windows without a hitch-Boosted my Windows Index from 5.9 (Seagate Barracuda 7.2k) to 7.7-Boot up times are seconds instead of the usual minute-Games are running smoother (need to do more testing on this end)Cons-The instructions - All pictures, no text.  Shows a SATA-USB cable as the ""only"" way to transfer files, which is incorrect for desktop.  Made me think I forgot to buy something.-Misc other papers (warranty explanation) didn\'t seem to be in English.  Found that odd.  There\'s a link to the English webpage at least.Samsung SoftwarePros-Easy to install with the CD provided-Samsung Magician does have nice but not essential benchmarks and optimization features.  It does take up system resources, so I wouldn\'t keep it on all the time.Cons-Samsung Migration tool!  The reason I docked a star on my review.  What a mess.  I attempted to migrate 3 times - all failed.  First time, it got to 91%, program stopped responding, and eventually gave me ""Failed to retrieve source disk  Error 205500 [0322bc].""  Not to mention, it didn\'t error out until an hour or two after it stopped responding.  Before my second attempt, I made sure my original HDD was defragged (which it was, didn\'t take long) and ran a full chkdsk.  No errors detected.  Started up the second attempt before I went to sleep.  Woke up 4 hours in, checked the migration, and another error!  I decided to give the tool one more chance, and I ran it for the third time.  Again, same result, another error.  Last two attempts did get to 99%, which made it all the more worse to see it error out.  I decided to go for a free trial of another HD migration program.  Got it right the first time.My SSD has only been up and running for 2 days since I got it recently.  I\'m still testing it out and will update my review if anything happens.Some tips:-Avoid the Samsung Migration Tool - If you really want to give it a shot, just give it one go.  It may be better with other Samsung products or SSDs.-When migrating your old HD, backup all of your data.  I had a trusty external HD around just in-case.-Make sure you have your Windows recovery CD handy just in-case the SSD didn\'t have a successful transfer of the booting requirements.-I chose to clone my original HDD since I worked on getting it below 250 GBs.  The program I used copied all partitions, including the System partition that you usually don\'t see but it is essential for getting Windows to boot up and work.  I then fed back my backed up data into my old HDD after I reformatted it.  The Samsung Migration Tool didn\'t notice the System partition from what I could tell (of course, I never got it to work with my main partition)-Only reformat your old HD after you are certain you are booting from your new SSD (assuming that is your goal).-Finally, check your motherboard\'s SATA connections and also the specs online.  I knew beforehand that my older motherboard would only support SATA II, so I would not be taking advantage of SATA III capabilities.  You will still see a noticeable difference than a regular HDD.', 'I read several reviews on how replacing an SSD could rejuvenate an old PC, but I was hesitant. The price drop to <$100 gave me an incentive to try. I ordered 3x 250GB SSDs in total.The first went into a 3.5 year old Samsung Series 5 Ultrabook. I was considering replacing this machine as it had gotten a bit slow over the years, but was otherwise still functioning perfectly. The upgrade was really easy. Plug the SSD into an external USB case, run Samsung software. It took about 1.5 hours. Open the back panel, do a 1-1 swap. Wow. What a difference. Boot time went from about 2-3 mins to under 15 seconds. Applications used to take 20-30 seconds to launch after bootup. After the upgrade, practically every app launched under 2 seconds.  Ran Samsung Magician to futher fine-tune the settings. I set it for ""Maximum Reliability"". Final result -- This ultrabook is good for a couple more years!The 2nd and 3rd went into 2 similar desktops. Asus motherboards from 2011 with iCore3 CPUs, Windows 7. Upgrading these was more difficult since both had 1TB drives, with lots of music, pictures, videos.First, I had to partition the drives into C: and D: using ""Disk Management"".Then, from the users directory, right-click each on ""My Documents"", ""My Music"", ""My Picture"", etc and change each location to D: drive. This copied the large folders onto D: drive. When done, C: drive was <150GB. This portion took the most amount of time.Next up was plugging the SSD into an available SATA slot on the motherboard. I didn\'t have a 2.5 inch mounting bracket, so I just used double-sided tape to secure the drive to the inside of the case. Cloning the C: drive was straight-forward using the Samsung software. After cloning, I swapped the SATA cables for the hard disk and SSD just for good measure. After booting, go immediately into BIOS to change the boot order to start from the SSD.Everything booted fine. The old C: drive was remapped to some other drive letter.The speed increase was unbelievable.Samsung Magician however indicated that the drives were running in IDE mode, rather than AHCI.If I simply set the BIOS from IDE to AHCI, windows would not start, it would keep rebooting.The fix was to run regedit, navigate toHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\MsahciSet the ""Start"" value to 0 (zero). It was previously at 3.Immediately, reboot and change the BIOS to use AHCI. Windows on starting recognized the new AHCI setting, installed drivers, and then rebooted once again.After that, everything worked well.Final step (optional) was to use ""Disk Management"" once again to shrink the size of the original C: drive, and enlarge the D: drive. So now, I have a 250GB SSD as by C: drive, and all the user data is stored on a 750GB partition on the original 1TB drive.Speed wise? Wow. As with the ultrabook, these 2 desktops are good for a couple more years.If you\'re hesitating -- this is the best $100 investment you can make to upgrade your PC.I plan to order more for friends/family.  :-)']"

This is a wonderful product and if you need the space, I highly recommend it along with the other reviewers who thoroughly cover it\'s excellent performance, value, simplicity of installation - watch the video - and well thought out features including a nice case for your old SSD drive.Transcend has really focused on the MacBookPro market and done a fantastic job.  Unfortunately, when you first investigate this drive and try to decide if it is a good choice, you will immediately read that Yosemite does not support something called TRIM on third party SSD drives like the Transcend JetDrive.  This is confusing and caused me to do a lot of research.<Update Note: as of July 2015, Oskar Groth was able resolve the TRIM issue with third party drives as he explains on his website.https://www.cindori.org/safely-enable-trim-on-yosemite-and-el-capitan/  Oskar explains that new functionality from Apple made this possible.  and I have downloaded his Disk Sensei application and can verify that Trim now works with no complications.  Disk Sensei is also a nice application with other useful features.  The text below is  interesting, so even though the TRIM issue is now resolved I\'m leaving it as it describes the issue and may help someone in the future if the TRIM issue returns with future Apple updates.>Top Level Summary: if you need the space, I think the TRIM issue shouldn\'t be a factor in your decision.TRIM is desirable, but I think you can safely buy this drive and not worry about TRIM.  If you are interested in the benefits of TRIM, the rest of this note explains how to safely and simply enable TRIM periodically.  The best news is that even if you want the benefits of TRIM, there is no urgency as you can always run TRIM later whenever you want to.Two quick notes that I think add to the discussion:1) Availability - it is probably wise to buy sooner rather than later because in it\'s most recent products, Apple is moving from SSD\'s with the SATA III interface to SSD\'s with the PCIe interface.  The very specific nature of Transcend JetDrive means that it addresses a limited market: a SATA III interface SSD that will fit in a MacBookPro.  The newest MacBookPro Retina now uses an SSD with a PCIe interface.  As a result,  if you are interested in upgrading the size of your MacBookPro SSD, it might be wise to buy this sooner rather than later, in case availability of a SATA III SSD that will fit in the MacBookPro becomes an issue as the PCIe SSD\'s become dominant in Apple\'s product line.2) As others have pointed out, TRIM is important but not critical.  You can buy this drive and not worry about TRIM.  However, if you want to have the benefits of TRIM, a small amount of effort makes it possible.  Unfortunately, Transcend can\'t supply this directly, but you can do it yourself quite easily.Long discussion on TRIM below:A1. Apple uses TRIMMavericks and Yosemite continuously run TRIM on Apple supplied SSD\'s.  However, for obvious but unwise business reasons, Apple will not run TRIM on third party SSD\'s.  Hence to run TRIM on the JetDrive 725 will take you some additional steps.  However, it is only necessary to run TRIM when you notice your SSD performance seems slow.  This would likely happen only after a few months of normal use or when the drive starts to become full.  In that case, with a small amount of effort, TRIM can be run as a batch process that TRIM\'s the entire disk.  If you don\'t mind an occasional inconvenience, you can easily run it periodically as part of your normal usage patterns (once a month? twice a year?).A2. 960GB of Laptop Space is GreatIn my opinion, TRIM is probably not a reason to hesitate on purchasing this drive if you want the additional space.  For example, if you use your MacBookPro for digital photography, a 960GB drive is extremely nice.  With a Nikon D800 a ""typical"" photo shoot event runs me about 10 - 20 GB of raw photos before I can select out the photos that seem best.  Also, I use Google Nik software filters, and because they use the lossless but horribly inefficient TIFF format, they create a 100MB copy of every one of the photos they touch.B1. TRIM is Important, Not CriticalTRIM is important but it isn\'t critical.  Even though Mavericks and Yosemite run TRIM continuously on Apple supplied SSD\'s, because of the nature of the kind of problem that TRIM is designed to solve, it doesn\'t have to run continuously.  TRIM is only necessary if you notice your SSD performance isn\'t as good as when you first installed it.B2. TRIM using an Alternate Boot Disk - booting off of an SDHC or SDXC Flash driveOnce TRIM is enabled, as Allan Marcus pointed out in his Mac OS X Hints post, it can be run in batch mode by Apple Disk Utility under the Repair Volume command.  Note: Disk Utility cannot run TRIM without first enabling TRIM, so you have two tasks: create an alternate boot disk and then enabling TRIM on that boot disk.With a TRIM enabled Yosemite running on an inexpensive SDHC or SDXC Flash Drive, it is simple to use the normal Mac interface to occasionally (once a month? Twice a year?) run TRIM.  Running TRIM periodically with  Disk Utility requires an alternate boot drive, because Disk Utility unmounts the disk it is working on.  It is possible to use the Apple Recovery Partition and ""single user mode"" to try to work around this, but it\'s not worth it.  Keeping an inexpensive SDXC backup copy of your OS and Applications is probably a good practice anyway.B3. Copying Your OS and Applications to a Flash DriveOne way to have the benefits of TRIM is to copy your Yosemite OS and Applications to an SD card flash drive.  For that purpose, I used a 128 GB flash drive and Carbon Copy Cloner.  My OS and Applications would easily fit within 64GB, but I used a 128GB card because I wanted the extra space and I liked the JetDriveLite form factor.B4. Once you have a bootable flash drive - Sequence to run a batch TRIM operation0) backup your entire JetDrive.  This is always a good idea because SSD\'s do fail.  Make sure your MacBookPro is plugged into working AC power and your battery is already fully charged in case of a power outage.  The steps you will follow are very benign, but backing up is always a good practice whenever you ""touch"" a disk.1) set your startup volume to be the MacOS you copied onto a SDHC or SDXC flash drive and reboot2) download (cindori.org Trim Enabler $10) and install ( this will install on your flash drive)3) enable TRIM using the convenient TRIM Enabler control panel,4) run Disk Utility to TRIM your drive - Open Disk Utility. Select your drive on the left pane, Click ""Repair Disk.""-- Is it dangerous to run Repair Disk on a healthy disk?  No.  Not unless you have a power interruption, so use AC power and run repair disk when your battery is fully charged.-- There are two philosophies: ""don\'t fix what\'s not broken,"" and preventative care.  Because filesystems are entirely deterministic,  I think preventative care is the better choice.  In principle, a Repair Disk operation can only discover inconsistencies, it cannot cause them.  My experience from rotating platter HDD\'s includes filesystem inconsistencies (""B-trees"" or mismatches in the numbers of allocated blocks) which were repaired. In at least two cases on old HDD\'s I needed Drive Genius to rebuild the directory table.  In those cases I only lost one or two files, not the entire data set.  My experience with SSD\'s is limited, but I have not seen those kind of errors on any SSD\'s I\'ve used.  I\'ve had an Apple supplied SSD fail completely in my MacBookPro 15"" Retina Early 2013, but luckily, I had a backup.-- So, unless a power interruption occurs (working AC power is important), repairing a healthy disk filesystem is a benign process.-- If you are unlucky enough to have major problems, the Repair operation may abort.  If that happens, you need to switch your efforts from trying to get TRIM to run, to fixing the filesystem data on your SSD.  Drive Genius is very useful in this case if you want to fix it yourself, but if not, take everything in to an  Apple store or other experienced computer professional.  If even Drive Genius is unsuccessful, you can always reformat your laptop SSD and restore from your backup, however in this case you may have an unreliable SSD and you might want to replace it.5) toward the end of Repair Disk processing, you will see in the log the line ""Trimming unused blocks""-- if you don\'t see that, then TRIM wasn\'t enabled and you need to check the TRIM Enabler control panel again to be sure you enabled TRIM.-- also, you can check ""About This Mac"" / ""System Report"" / ""SATA/SATA Express""  and look for ""TRIM Support""-- If you install the Transcend utility, JetDriveToolbox, be aware that it is unintentionally misleading.  Even when TRIM is not enabled in the MacOS, under ""DRIVE"" it says ""Trim Command Supported"" but that refers to the SSD controller in the JetDrive - not the full OS - so you can\'t use that to judge the status of TRIM on your computer.6) when Repair Disk is completed, disable TRIM,-- this last step is important.  you need to disable TRIM using the convenient TRIM Enabler control panel-- if you forget, it\'s not terrible, but you are leaving your system a little more vulnerable-- also, other users have reported in the forums a subtle result from ""turning off"" the Apple ""signed kernel"" protection.  If you haven\'t used a clean install to put Yosemite on your computer ( I almost never use clean install), you might have old and incompatible MacOS extensions in your System folder.  When Trim Enabler has enabled TRIM, it  also changes a setting in the laptop nvram that tells Yosemite to ignore the ""signed kernel"" requirement.  If you forget to disable TRIM, those old extensions will load and may cause subtle problems in other programs (like Airplay shows video but not audio). This is unlikely, but it did show up in some of the forums.7) set your JetDrive 725 as the startup volume and rebootYou are done.  You can perform this sequence  every now and then as a preventative measure or just wait until you think you are getting poor write performance out of your SSD.Finally, you don\'t have to run TRIM if you never notice your SSD performance isn\'t as good as when you bought it.  Technically TRIM does help SSD ""wear,"" but SSD manufacturers do not rely on TRIM for their longevity.  In any event,  it is absolutely not critical to run TRIM frequently, so you truly don\'t have to worry about TRIM unless you notice a performance problem .B5. Enabling TRIM for Third Party SSD\'s - ReferenceAs cited by Rich in the Amazon Q&A section, the issues surrounding third party SSD\'s, Yosemite, and TRIM are explained in detail on http://www.cindori.org/trim-enabler-and-yosemite/ by Oskar Groth.  This is well worth reading if you are interested.B6. Enabling TRIM for Third Party SSD\'s - What is TRIM and its importance?TRIM is an important capability and I wish Apple\'s policy on third party SSD solutions did not make this a concern.  However, for anyone considering the wonderful Transcend JetDrive product and concerned about the question of TRIM, as I explained above, I am convinced that it is possible to run TRIM without a major inconvenience or risk.  TRIM is ""not required,"" but because an SSD write operation requires an earlier erase, it means that over time an SSD with normal activity will start to have lots of blocks of data that have been ""deleted"" in the MacOS, but not erased on the SSD by the SSD controller.SSD\'s aren\'t designed around a specific filesystem, so the SSD controller isn\'t built to understand any of the specifics of the MacOS filesystem.  Even though the allocation tables the MacOS uses to assign and de-assign (or ""delete"") the blocks used by a particular file are stored on the SSD, the controller itself can\'t read or understand the allocation tables and does not know which SSD blocks the OS has marked as ""deleted"" and hence, are ready to erase.  That is why finding which blocks toTRIM must be an Operating System function, not an SSD controller function.Eventually, as the number of ""un-erased but deleted"" blocks increase, the MacOS will start to have a significant number of writes that occur on blocks that require an erase cycle first, and write performance will suffer significantly on those writes.There are interesting details in how an SSD works, and to some extent the SSD moves data around on its own for longevity purposes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_amplification).  As a consequence of moving the data,  the likelihood of having lots of ""un-erased but deleted"" blocks is reduced.  For this reason,  TRIM may not be as necessary, however, it is factually true that any system capable of running TRIM does - including Apple\'s MacBookPro implementation of SSD\'s in Mavericks and Yosemite.The trick is that Apple has made it ""more difficult"" to run TRIM on third party SSD drives in Yosemite because of a new security feature.  Yosemite\'s default is to only boot from a ""kernel"" that is ""signed.""  A ""signed kernel"" means that Apple can guarantee that it is more difficult for malware to corrupt the basic operating system.  Whether this is a good feature or not can be debated, but it seems desirable to me as one more small step at fighting off potential attacks on your computer.It seems clear that TRIM is very useful for most people over time, and one important point is that because it is a filesystem function, it can be invoked as a batch operation using Apple\'s Disk Utility.B7. Example Disk Utility Log (command line - you can use the GUI)Specifically, if you enable TRIM (Trim Enabler from cindori.org is one method) and run the Apple Disk Utility and select Repair Volume, the Disk Utility will trim the unused/deleted blocks by commanding the SSD controller to erase the list of blocks it sends.Transcript of a Trim sessionThe command line below runs diskutil on the JetDrive volume labeled ""myDrive"" and mounted in my alternate boot Flash OS as /Volumes/myDrive.  My setup is slightly more complicated as I split my jetDrive into two partitions.diskutil repairvolume /Volumes/myDriveStarted file system repair on disk0s4 myDriveRepairing file systemChecking Journaled HFS Plus volumeChecking extents overflow fileChecking catalog fileChecking multi-linked filesChecking catalog hierarchyChecking extended attributes fileChecking volume bitmapChecking volume informationTrimming unused blocks <---- this line shows that the MacOS TRIM operation has been run to tell the SSD which blocks on the volume are unused and need to be ""erased""The volume Users appears to be OKFile system check exit code is 0Updating boot support partitions for the volume as requiredFinished file system repair on disk0s4 myDrive', 'I have been waiting to buy this, because the JetDrive 720 that I purchased would not fit my Mid 2012 15"" Retina MBP. I have been corresponding with someone at transcend and although they would not provide any measurements, they assured me this unit would fit my machine.It\'s disappointing that the same capacity drive, that will fit my computer, is priced $100 more.It does not appear that there is any difference in the SSD between this unit and the 720 of equal capacity.Update Jul 19, 2014The 725 fits even better than stock and I am pleased to announce that when it is installed in my computer, it performs better than the SSD drive that was shipped with my Mid 2012 MBP Retina.  It is also priced the same as the 720, therefore my earlier comment no longer applies. For these reasons, I have modified my rating of the product.My primary reason for purchasing this product was because my stock 256 SSD did not have sufficient space for both a  bootcamp and osx partition. After juggling apps on my 60GB boot camp partition one too many times, I decided to upgrade the SSD drive. I wanted to store a few VMs that I commonly run, on the internal drive. When flying, I sometimes access an external drive and worry that the external drive will fall or the port will be damaged if my computer is bumped. With almost a TB of space, I can now store VMs and other files that would require me to connect an external drive while traveling.  Since I frequently run more than one VM, it is imperative that the drive have good performance. To determine the performance of the drive, I ran several benchmarks using the Black Magic performance tool.  I ran the test against all of the drives that I frequently have connected to my MBP. To reduce the chance of incompatibility issues among different hardware and port speeds, I rebooted my computer between tests, and had only one drive connected at a time.  While I was testing, I made an  observation related to the speed of the spinning drives. Although It\'s not directly related to this product, I though some of you may find it interesting.  The issue only seems to present itself when connecting spinning drives, which require more power than SSD drives. When connected to an external, powered, USB 3 hub, the spinning drive performance improved by about 10% when compared to their performance while connected directly to the MBP.I enabled trim on the 725 using Trim Enabler.  It is unclear if this is necessary anymore,  and unclear if the changes made by the tool work. When I check the trim status  using Chameleon SSD Optimizer, after enabling trip support with Trim Enabler,  it does not report that trip is enabled.  Each of the 3 SSD drives perform very well, with the transcend having the best performance followed closely by the stock SSD and the Samsung 840.  The Samsung 840 performance is dependent on the connection, and given the fact it is connected via the GoFlex, the performance of the SSD cannot be fairly compared to the Stock and 725 drives which were installed in the same machine.Below are the test results I observed while using BlackMagic. The numbers are the first recorded read and write speed test (PAL) and not an average of all of the video codecs.Disk,  Read MB/Sec., Write MB/Sec.Transcend 725 installed in MBP,  465,  440Stock 256GB SSD installed in MBP,  446,  329Transcend 725 SSD installed in External USB enclosure.  398,  387Stock 256GB SSD installed in Transcend Adapter connected directly to MBP,  386,  316Other drives for comparisonSeagate GoFlex Thunderbolt adapter with bare Samsung 840 SSD installed,  373,  318Seagate Backup Plus USB3 connected to powered 7 port Anker USB3 Hub,  82,  66Seagate Backup Plus USB3 connected directly to MBP (same Drive as above) ,  72,  61WD My Passport USB3 connected to powered 7 port Anker USB3 Hub,  93,  91WD My Passport USB3 connected directly to MBP (same Drive as above),  83,  78Transcend SDXC Class 10 SD Card connected to MBP SD slot,  48,  18', 'Unterm Strich hat alles so funktioniert wie es sollte, aber die mitgelieferte ""Anleitung"" verdient es nicht, so genannt zu werden:Es werden Zwischenschritte nicht erwähnt, manchmal ist die Beschreibung nicht genau genug. Z.B., wie man zu dem Boot Menü gelangt: In der Anleitung steht, man sollte die ""Control / Alt Taste"" drücken. Tatsächlich sind aber nicht beide Tasten gemeint (wenn man beide gleichzeitig drückt, kommt das Menü nicht), sondern nur die ""Alt""-Taste.Und so geht es weiter, es gäbe noch mehr Beispiele... Fairerweise sollte man aber sagen: Jemand, der sich prinzipiell zutraut, selbst eine Festplatte in einem Laptop auszutauschen, sollte sich zurecht finden. Wer es noch nie bei einem MacBook gemacht hat: Vorher im Internet nachsehen, wie man eine Festplatte repariert/ klont und wie das Motherboard aussieht und wo die auszutauschende SSD ist.Der Vorgang des Klonens und des Austauschens selbst war ein Kinderspiel. Die mitgelieferten Werkzeuge haben perfekt gepasst, die SSD ließ sich passgenau ohne Gerüttel und Drücken einsetzen und fixieren - perfekt!Wie bereits hier in einer anderen Rezension geschrieben: Nach dem Austausch noch festlegen, dass die neue SSD das neue Startvolume ist, damitd er Boot-Vorgang schneller geht.Also für das Produkt an sich gebe ich gerne 5 Sterne!1 Stern Abzug für die nicht so tolle Anleitung. Ich hätte gerne ein paar Euro mehr gezahlt und dafür eine komplette, ausführliche Anleitung vor mir gehabt!Und in Gedanken noch einen *heftigen* Abzug für die Versand-Verpackung von Amazon, die ich fairerweise nicht dem Produkt geben kann:Amazon hat diese Ware in dem ""offene Seiten"" Karton verschickt. Wer diesen Verpackungstyp nicht kennen sollte: Das Päckchen hat die Größe eines dicken Hardcover-Buchs, und ist an den beiden Seiten (""oben"" und ""unten"", wenn man bei der Buch-Metapher bleibt) nicht verschlossen (!!!), sondern hat an diesen Stellen Papp-Laschen, die man mit der Hand nach innen drückt. Sie werden nicht verklebt oder sonstwie gesichert! Und man kann diese Laschen auch genauso leicht mit der Hand wieder herausziehen und hat somit das Päckchen geöffnet, ohne dass man es ihm ansieht.Dadurch kann jedermann in der Lieferkette problemlos das Päckchen zerstörungsfrei öffnen und wieder schließen. Außerdem schließt das Päckchen so nicht komplett. Wenn Kleinteile versendet werden (z.B. SD Speicherkarten), können diese seitlich hinausfallen (ist mir schon passiert bzw. wurden alternativ wie oben beschrieben geklaut).Das sollte Amazon wirklich bei Produkten im Wert von über 500 Euro anders lösen! Zum Glück konnte ich das Päckchen persönlich entgegennehmen und gleich nachsehen, ob alles passt.', 'Ziel war ein altes Macbook Pro Retina mit mehr Speicherplatz zu versorgen. Nach nunmehr 6 Jahren sind die 250GB in dem Macbook doch etwas knapp geworden, aber das Notebook funktioniert nachwievor einwandfrei.Also wurde das Jetdrive 725 gekauft und die 480 GB Version wurde dann auch schnell geliefert. Zur Zeit ist der Preisverlauf linear.Enthalten ist Werkzeug, ein Case (+Kabel) und die SSD. Im Prinzip muss man ""nur"" die neue Platte im USB Case einbauen und anstecken, den Mac im Recovery Modus starten, die USB Platte formatieren und die interne SSD auf diese klonen, dann die neue Platte in den Mac einbauen und ist fertig. Die alte Platte kann man dann als großen USB Stick nutzen ;)Hätte das genauso funktioniert, hätte ich 5 Sterne gegeben.--- Probleme ---Folgende Probleme muss man lösen:1. Der Recovery Modus ist nicht wie in der Anleitung beschrieben mit CTRL+R zu erreichen sondern mit COMMAND-R. Ich vermute einen Übersetzungsfehler, da die englische Beschreibung korrekt ist.2. Das viel größere Problem ist High Sierra. Man kann die externe Platte zwar formatieren, aber unabhängig welche Formatierung man nutzt, das Klonen schlägt im letzten Schritt fehl. Eine kurze Suche nach dem Fehlercode zeigt, dass es sich dabei um einen Bug in High Sierra handelt.--- Lösungen ---1. Command R zu finden ist kein wirkliches Problem, aber darauf hinweisen muss man schon, ansonsten findet man die Boot Tastenkombinationen auch im Netz.2. Mit dem ""Carbon Copy Cloner"" kann man in Macos einfach die interne Platte auf die SSD klonen und anschließend dann tauschen. Das funktioniert super und immerhin gibt es auch noch eine 30 Tage Testversion vom Carbon Copy Cloner. Alternativ soll auch die Wiederherstellung aus einem TimeMachine Backup funktionieren, ist aber von mir nicht getestet worden.Ein kleiner Hinweis in der Anleitung wäre hilfreich gewesen. Wobei ich natürlich annehme, dass die SSD nach dem High Sierra Release produziert wurde.--- Fazit ---Nach 1 Woche Benutzung kann ich bisher nur Positives von der neuen SSD sagen. Der neu gewonnene Platz ist eine echte Erleichterung und von der Geschwindigkeit her gibt es gefühlt keine Unterschiede zu der alten SSD. Speedtests habe ich aber auch keine durchgeführt.Wenn die 480GB auch voll werden, würde ich sicherlich zur 960GB Variante wechseln.', ""This is one of the few options to upgrade the SSD hard drive capacity of the Retina Macbook Pro (OWC is the other alternative).  I chose this over OWC because it comes with the external case to house your current/old SSD plus the tools at the same price as the OWC one without.  I've had this for about a month now, and overall it's a solid replacement and works well.  I can't comment on speed/benchmarks, but I'm sure you can find plenty of those on professional tech websites and magazines.The actual swapping of the drive is really simple: unscrew the pentalobe screws on the Macbook Pro with the provided tool (keeping track of which screws came out of where, since there are 3 different sizes).  Open the computer, then remove the black torx (or hex?) screw with the other tool.  Slide out the old SSD, put in the new SSD, screw it back on.  Screw the case screws back on.  Put the old one into the included case and screw that close.  Done.I tried to move my old Windows partition (was using Bootcamp) to the new drive, but it doesn't work that well, not with the stock Disk Utility.  You probably need to buy an actual software that does this.  Even when I copied the partition, it wouldn't boot to Windows (the contents are there), and I couldn't change the partition size (the Windows partition was 100GB I believe-- I couldn't make it 200).  It has to do with the way the boot partion works on Windows.  There were some ways to fix it I found on the web, but seems like a lot of trouble, especially considering that I don't have much data saved on the Windows partition (cloud storage FTW!).  So I just repartitioned the new JetDrive SSD the way I wanted it (Windows/MacOS) and reinstalled MacOS and Windows in their respective partitions.  Your situation and mileage may differ.  I will say that if you have a 100% MacOS drive without any Windows partition, then moving your old data/program/files to the new drive will work easily via the instructions they provide to copy the drive via Disk Utility.  The universe never intended Macbooks to run Windows, hehe...In conclusion, for the price, this is a great way to upgrade your SSD hard drive capacity in your MacBook Pro Retina.  I wish they had one for my MacBook Air; hopefully soon.  I think about 500GB SSD is ideal for me because I have a lot of files in the cloud, but also a lot of local files too."", 'I bought a Transcend 960GB JetDrive 725 SATA III SSD as an upgrade for my 2012 MacBook Pro (15"" Retina Display, 512GB SATA SSD), as I had nearly managed to fill my Mac\'s internal storage through my hobby of digital photography (over 300GB of photos in Apple Aperture and Adobe Lightroom).The first shipment that I received from Amazon appeared to be faulty, so I contacted Transcend\'s UK support team via email, describing the symptoms. I received a prompt reply, recommending that I return the item to Amazon. The replacement worked without any issues at all, so I\'ll put the first one down to a faulty batch (or Amazon\'s woefully inadequate packaging - electronic devices should be shipped with decent protective padding!).The Transcend upgrade instructions are quite terse, and so I would recommend following the Transcend upgrade video video which provides helpful guidance on each of the steps. I would also recommend using a proper anti-static bench mat + earthing cable + wrist strap when performing the upgrade, to avoid damaging your precious Mac with static discharge (I bought mine from Amazon).I ran some performance benchmarks on my MacBook under OS X 10.10.5 Yosemite before the upgrade using BlackMagic, and this achieved \u2028358 MBytes/s Writes and 445 MBytes/s Reads (with filesystem encrypted with FileVault). After the Transcend upgrade and encrypting the file system, BlackMagic reported 420 MBytes/s Write (17% improvement) and 503 MBytes/s Read (27% improvement).I\'ve actually kept the original 512MByte SATA SSD in the Transcend nice aluminium case, but I\'ve kept the original OS installation as an emergency just in case), however, I haven\'t needed it as the Transcend memory since the upgrade.I can\'t comment on the use or ""Trim"" with the Transcend SSD, as I am not using it under OS X 10.10.5. However, there are plenty of on-line articles and discussions on Mac-related forums about using Trim with OS X and/or using Transcend Toolbox. I understand this is particularly important for OS X releases after Yosemite (NB: I am still using Yosemite because Apple Aperture is not supported on El Capitan or later!).Overall, an excellent quality upgrade.', ""Your initial requirement for upgrading any SSD would be more space. Of course, you'd like the added speed bump, but then again, you were already there. So, when it comes to space, yes! Good choice, all offer the same space increments.However, when it comes to speed? I would not recommend this drive if you want a massive upgrade. I have installed this on a MacBook Pro Retina 15 10,1 (the first ever retina released). The Samsung Flash installed in it wrote at about 350mb/s and read at around 400mb/s. You can say that JetDrive 725 probably boosted things by around 30mb. I've attached a screenshot. Sadly, lost my original one for the samsung drive. You'll have to take my word for this.I did not re-format the drive. I restored it from a Time Machine backup which probably could explain the lack of speed improvement.The installation was really simple, so if that is what is deterring you from buying, don't be stupid. They have a good webpage explaining everything with a video, follow that. The 13incher is a bit more painful than the 15in MacBook.The added bonus is the external enclosure being added. Allows for some great high-speed transfers there via USB. Small enough to fit in a pocket.So, my verdict. If I were to upgrade to 1TB would I go JetDrive? Probably... unless I get something for the same price with a better read/write speed.(Note) A buddy just bought his 13in Retina, his read write (samsung drive included with purchase) is around 650mb/s. No idea what causes it, probably newer internals.Hope this allows you to make a conscious buying decision. I really required a space improvement, so I bought this. Had it been for speed, probably not. Do your research, check OWC's drive, don't take their read write speeds, find out someone else's experience with it."", 'Update 2: Two years and nine months after purchase, the drive\'s partitions no longer appear and it is presumed dead. I suspect I may have exceeded the maximum write count by compiling Android on it a few times.-----Update: Someone left a comment that fixes the drive on Windows, and now it\'s pretty snappy in both Windows and OS X. However, since it doesn\'t work out of the box I\'m leaving off two stars. The ""fix"" works by disabling low power mode on Windows, so I imagine it may decrease battery life.-----Here\'s Amazon user DS\'s original comment that fixes the issue:Had the same problem with Windows 10. The following solved it for me:1. Open Device Manager to lookup the drive\'s device string (I have TS480GJDM725).2. Turn off LPM by adding the device string toHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\storeahci\\Parameters\\Device\\NoLPM(I added ""TS480GJDM725*"")3. Restart.-----Here\'s the original review (titled ""Locks up in Windows 10 under Boot Camp""):I bought this drive two years ago so that I\'d have enough storage to install OS X and Windows side by side while still having enough space for the raw audio and video associated with video and music production. On OS X 10.9-10.11, it performs as well as or better than the original drive even with FileVault enabled, so no complaints here.However, in Windows 10 (build 10586) it locks up every now and then for a few seconds or minutes at a time. In Chrome, this can mean the browser is stuck ""Waiting for cache"" for a very long time - sometimes so long that Chrome gives up on loading the page. UWP apps, like the Mail app, interpret this as the app being unresponsive and are occasionally forcibly closed. Other programs that normally take under a second to load can take minutes. This includes the Task Manager, which means I can\'t even kill the program that started the offending read request. This happens even if I disable BitLocker.That said, seeing that Windows detects this as a generic drive and uses the generic drivers, this could also very well be Microsoft\'s fault. Unfortunately, downgrading to Windows 8.1 (which has worked fine in the past) is not an option for me because of work requirements.', 'It is a 5 Stars for now, since the JetDrive is working fine.  But I am writing this because of the initial booting of this hard drive was a disaster.  The installation went seamless, after I discovered that the directions are incorrect.  To get to the Disk Utility you need to use the Command-R keys, not the option key went restarting.When I first started the Macbook with the Transcend JetDrive, it booted quickly and Safari opened. Then it quickly went dead.  I rebooted and the MacBooks fans started roaring at top speed and then again when dead.  I rebooted a couple of more times, and it never even when though the booting procedure before going dead.  So my heart sank and felt like I had just wasted $500 and maybe more if my Macbook was been destroyed in the process.I decided to trying rebooting but with the old ssd drive which I had installed in the Transcend external drive casing.  The Macbook booted up fine from the old drive.  So at that point I was about ready to uninstall the Transcend card and install the old card.  But ever hopeful I tried rebooting again with the Transcend and to my utter surprise, it booted up fine.  It is now two days later and the Transcend has operated perfectly.  I am getting great speeds on both the Transcend and the old ssd drive now installed in the Transcend casing.I am writing this because others might have similar experience.  Why did the Transcend fail to work initially and then started working.  I have no idea.  The only thing I did after the initial failures of the Transcend to stay booted was the rebooting with the old ssd card from the USB drive.  But it might be worth a try should you have problems like I did.I am hoping my luck continues with the Transcend. It really nice to have the extra hard drive space with such speed as well.', ""I had Early 2013 Macbook Pro Retina 15 inch with 256 GB SSD and 8GB RAM.

Once installed it rebooted and worked beautifully.I then removed the screws at back of my mac and replaced the SSD. Put my original ssd in the enclosure. The ssd now only shows 90 GB (partition I had given for my windows boot). I still can't format rest but the enclosure can be used to access the 90GB easily as a USB drive (worked in mac but windows did not even recognise the drive).I had read a lot of reviews on lower performance compared to original ssd. I have not run any benchmarks but as a normal user (who does development work) I have not seen any deterioration in performance or boot time. I am very happy with it for now. Hope it works consistently at this quality. I now use Parallels instead of bootcamp as I have enough ssd space and don't want to risk another partition issue.""]"

Instructions are best-case, assuming everything will go according to plan, and non-specific to the unit you buy.  If you run into trouble, the instructions are useless.Photographic illustrations are smudges.  (Apparently Transcend subscribes to the Rohrschach School of technical guidance.)The product works, in the end, and so far works very well.  But you cannot rely on the given instructions.  Lots of issues can be solved with common sense, but others need guidance.  If you aren\'t used to messing around in a Mac\'s guts, you\'ll need some patience and you\'ll have to think through problems like an engineer at times.For instance, your disk will rattle around inside at least some MacBooks if you don\'t secure it properly.  There\'s no instruction for that in the Quick Installation guide.  It involves removing some screws from your old disk drive and installing them in the SSD; these fit into a removable bracket; only one of the securing brackets needs to be loosened.  Not difficult to figure out, but there\'s no mention of it in the directions.There\'s no explanation of such important terms as TRIM (caution with this!).But to Transcend\'s credit, the drive comes with a pretty complete installation kit that includes all the tools you\'ll need.  (The USB3 cord they supply was constructed on the close-enough-is-good-enough premise.  I wound up having to use one that I use for my Passport outboard drive.)The price is not great unless / until you factor in the drive chassis that they include.  It basically means that you can wipe and re-use your old drive as an outboard storage unit.  The chassis itself is a dodgy little thing, and it took me a a try or two to figure out the best method for attaching the drive to it.  (Hint: remove the business-end with the connectors first, attach it to the SSD drive, drop it in, seal from the back.)  Again: a larger, better, more complete installation guide written by a Humanities graduate would be most useful.Similarly, your old drive won\'t fit into the chassis until you remove the screws that hold it in place in the computer.  (You have to do that anyway, to put them in your new SSD to secure it in the computer.  But the Installation Guide is much less than clear about this.)Finally got it done: it\'s skimming along beautifully so far.  I upgraded my RAM at the same time as putting in the SSD, and I\'m wondering why I didn\'t do this years ago.', 'I\'ve worked in the computer world since 1969 and got my first PC in the mid \'80s. So, I have a fair amount of time ""inside the box,"" so to speak. I stopped working in the computer industry in the late 1980s. Since then, I\'ve mostly maintained my own stable of computers and haven\'t tried to keep up on all the standards and jargon.I wanted to replace the 7 year old HD (hard disk) in my MacBook Pro (mid 2009) with a SDD (solid state disc - the sort of storage that is found in iPhones, iPads and the new MacBook) before it died and took my data with it.Looking around Amazon, I found many SDDs in the 500 GB range (my target size - about 3 times the size of my HD and still affordable). Most were ""one size fits all"" replacement units. I had heard about Transcend on a couple of the ""Mac hints"" type web sites. So, I looked with special interest at their offerings. This one peaked my interest: a complete Mac kit and only a few dollars more than just a replacement unit, that wouldn\'t have the external housing, USB cable or tools. Plus, the JetDrive arrives formatted for Mac. You don\'t have to spend an hour or so reformatting a 500 GB drive from Windows to Mac.Boy am I glad I did it.The kit includes the two tools necessary for the job. I have lots of small phillips screwdrivers (a #00 is needed). But I didn\'t have the #6 Torx necessary for moving the four screws from the HD to the SDD. It is as easy as the video shows. The ""copy and verify"" step took about two hours to move about 100 GB of data and programs from the HD to the SDD. The whole process was less than 2-½ hours, including the data transfer. I now have the old HD in the case, as a 150 GB ""flash drive.""I expected quieter and cooler operation with more storage and quicker response. I am satisfied in all areas. However, the performance improvement blows my mind. When I\'d open a new program with the HD, it would sit and spin for a few seconds. Now, with the SDD, they mostly POP open.I was looking at a new MacBook for the smaller size and weight. However, I found that my MacBook Pro performed better on most things than the new MacBook or the MacBook Air. With this new SDD, the performance is another level higher. Ok, it\'s not a two pound computer. I\'ll live with four pounds and keep about $1000 in my pocket and have as good or better performance.', ""Installing this was supposed to be easy, but you really need to do your research online (read some of the reviews here) before you start. The QuickInstall Guide isn't useful at all, but the video on the Transcend website might be useful to some. My drive didn't work inside the computer, and after recloning, reinstalling etc. it turned out a faulty SATA cable was the issue. Apparently an SSD is more sensitive to malfunctions in the cable than an HDD, which would explain why the original HDD worked and the SSD didn't. I got a new one for $25 and installed the SSD again, which now works.I mailed support when the problem first occured and didn't hear back from them for a week, until I mailed again, but this time to their Amazon Review mail. They had a glitch in the e-mail system on their website. When I mailed the Amazon review address for Transcend, I got a response within 5 minutes, and further e-mail were mostly answered within hours, even late at night. They sent me a more detailed install guide and asked me to check if the cables were connected correctly inside the computer. Unfortunately, I had to figure out if the cable was the problem, which it was. So while the support was no use to me, they were fast.Compared to the Samsung EVO SSD (I didn't buy it so I can't tell you if it works just as well) I see that this one has an external drive, screwdrivers and a USB cable included, while the Samsung EVO SSD's only seems to include just the drive. The external drive came in handy while cloning the drive (I advise using Disk Utility's restore option, as is stated in the expanded manual which can be found on the Transcend website), and the screwdriver for the hard drive was handy as well (other screws can be removed with a small Philips screwdriver as well, but it was nice both screwdrivers came with this SSD so you know you're using the right one). Pro's of the Samsung's EVO as I see from the product page is that it has 20GB more capacity and is somewhat cheaper. So if you need the external drive for cloning and the screwdriver for the installation, I'd advise you pay some more for this product. If you already have those products, you might want to look at the Samsung EVO SSD series.I installed the drive in a MacBook mid 2012 (9,2) and it works just fine after replacing the SATA cable. Computer is way faster now (I also upgraded my RAM by 4GB, went from 2x2GB to 2x4GB). Please see other reviews for actual transfer speed numbers. In the end, I'm happy with my purchase and happy with spending a bit more for the extras that are included with the SSD, but after a week of frustration trying to figure out what the problem was.Also, don't forget to install the JetDrive Toolbox from the Transcend website to keep your SSD healthy."", 'Hier bei amazon.de habe ich das JetDrive 420 mit 480 GB für mein MacBook Pro (Anfang 2011, 15’ mit 8 GB Ram, OS X 10.9.4) gekauft. Bis jetzt bin ich sehr zu frieden, allerdings hat bei mir die Anleitung zur Installation der SSD von der Homepage nicht geklappt. Das Festplattendienstprogramm hat beim Versuch die Daten von der Festplatte auf die SSD zu kopieren eine Fehlermeldung ausgegeben und nichts kopiert.Ich vermute es lag an meiner alten Festplatte, die mit 750 GB einfach größer als die SSD mit 480 GB ist. Auf meiner alten Festplatte hatte ich 257 GB an Daten.Ich bin so vorgegangen:1.  SuperDuper (Version 2.7.2) aus dem Internet geladen. Die Demoversion reicht aus und ist kostenlos.2. JetDrive 420 (SSD-Modul) in das externe Gehäuse einsetzen- vergleich Video von Homepage (alle nötigen Schraubendreher werden mitgeliefert)3. SSD mit Rechner (USB-Anschluss) verbinden4. Mit SuperDuper! alle Daten der alten Festplatte auf JetDrive kopieren (einschließlich Boot fähig machen)- das Kopieren hat mehrere Stunden gedauert (ich konnte nebenei weiter am Rechner arbeiten)5. Die SSD aus dem Gehäuse genommen und ins MacBook Pro eingebaut (vgl. Video von Homepage)6. Start des MacBooks mit neuer SSD7. Es startet (noch etwas langsam) Mac OS X - in der Systemsteuerung unter Startvolume die neue SSD auswählen und neu starten (das geht dann relativ fix)8. JetDrive Toolbox von der transcend Homepage laden, installieren und starten9. In der Toolbox unter JetDrive - TRIM den TRIM-Status auf on stellen und Rechner neu starten10.

Seguramente no me habría equivocado con él, pero el hecho de que la página de Samsung no tenga ningún soporte para Mac me hizo inclinarme por este.Con el JetDrive 420 mi veterano MacBook unibody de finales de 2008 es ahora un torpedo. He duplicado su capacidad de almacenamiento y la velocidad de lectura/escritura se ha multiplicado por cinco. Eso sí, al ser mi MacBook SATA II las velocidades alcanzadas no se corresponden con las que anuncia el fabricante, que están calculadas sobre SATA III. El test de BlackMagic da 205Mb/s en escritura y 268Mb/s el lectura. Ya digo: cinco veces más rápido que con el disco original. Las aplicaciones se abren de forma casi instantánea y el sistema está totalmente operativo en veinte segundos.La memoria flash es MLC, que es algo más fiable y duradera que la TLC que monta el EVO aunque, honestamente, no creo que un usuario normal vaya a notar mucho esa diferencia.Montarlo me llevó todavía menos tiempo que lo que dice el video de la web de Trascend: es extremadamente sencillo. Y el hecho de que incluya una carcasa de alumnio para dar una nueva vida al disco original es todo un detalle.Creo que soy el primero en opinar en la tienda española, pero si miras las opiniones de clientes en el resto de tiendas Amazon verás que en todas se da a este producto la máxima puntuación.Y que no se me olvide: Amazon tardó menos de 24 horas en servírmelo. Espectacular.', ""I got this for a mid-2012 Macbook Pro with a 2.5 Ghz Intel i5 CPU, and 4 GB system RAM.Pros:1) Prior to the hardware swap, I had to do a clone from the old Macbook Pro hard drive to the new solid state drive (SSD) using SuperDuper software. El Capitan did not support the clone out of the box using recovery menu. The backup process took about 1 hour, but I was using no more than 15-20% of the 500GB hard drive. Your time may vary. This process is easy to figure out. SuperDuper will make your new SSD bootable, and ready to replace the internal hard drive.2) If you know how to work a screw driver, and how to pry open things with care, you will not take more than 15 minutes to do the hardware installation.3) Once I closed it all up, the MacBook took a few seconds before the white screen disappeared and it booted up within 10 seconds. I selected bootable drive as the new Solid State drive, and from that point on, the reboots and power-on time has gone down further. All in all, the macbook boots about 50% faster.4) The apps launch about 30% quicker on an average (some showed great improvement, some little) and it only now feels like a true i5 grade machine. Quite snappy and satisfactory. I am a power user and use a gaming grade windows desktop.5) The package came with everything necessary, no complaints. After the process, I now have a 500GB external hard drive which is also my original Macbook pro hard drive just in case things fail. You could keep a practice of cloning your new SSD to the old HDD every month or so using Super Duper, so you always have a bootable clone handy to swap.Cons:None!P.S. I am now planning to bump the memory from 4gb to 16gb (Crucial) and it'll definitely complement the SSD replacement and boost the multi-tasking and overall performance. Together, these two components will bring your laptop well into 2014-2015 grade performance benchmark."", ""Il est possible d'installer ce disque dur SSD sur un macbook Intel, quelque soit sa génération étant donné que les cartes mères pour processeurs Intel sont bien équipés de l'interface SATA (ATA Serial).Certes, pour les plus anciens, le débit ne sera que de 1,5 Gbits/sec alors que le disque dur peut aller jusqu'à 6, c'est 4 fois moins que ses possibilités théoriques, mais peu importe! Les temps d'accès sont tellement améliorés, les débits de lecture et d'écriture aussi, que ça donne vraiment une seconde jeunesse à votre vieil ordi (le mien à 7 ans et je ne jure que par lui).Autonomie accrue, silence de fonctionnement, chauffe réduite, vitesse de chargement des fichiers et programmes largement accrue, ce n'est que du bon.Les outils fournis font leur affaire et le boîtier vous dote d'un disque dur externe impeccable.Je vous conseille de scotcher la sonde de température au disque car celui-ci étant bien plus fin que les disques durs mécaniques, la sonde ne plaque plus naturellement sur le nouveau disque ssd."", ""I can't say anything about durability, because I just got the disk. I am writing this review just to tell everyone how easy it is to install this device on your macbook. I have a Mid 2012 Macbook Pro with El Capitan installed whose 5400rpm disk was starting to fail and I searched for some ways to upgrade what was a 2k bucks machine.At least for me, the installation part was exactly as depicted on the video. The kit includes the 2 screwdrivers needed to install it.The only 'tricky' part is making sure you clone your disk (or get the complete installer for High Sierra). For me, cloning was the answer, and Super Duper came along to the rescue.So, putting aside the disk cloning (took around 2 hours with super duper) installing the disk and turning on the laptop was a 15 minutes process.Everything is working as it is supposed to be, but like 10 times as fast. The difference on performance is remarkable.For now, it is work the bucks and I totally recommend using this product for a mid 2012 macbook pro non retina."", ""Only had the JetDrive (480) for a few days, but am extremely pleased with it.  It has speeded my MacBook Pro (mid-2010) significantly; boot up, and particularly, application loading.  I have not measured the increase, but it appears to be near the 4 to 5 times advertised.  So far I have found no issues nor problems.  I did have to use CCC to clone the hard drive; I had two unsuccessful attempts using the Mac's disk utility as shown in the Transcend video.  Cloning can be a time-consuming chore; mine took about 2.5 hrs. for approximately 180Gb of data.  The hard drive fits snuggly into the supplied case, but with some encouragement it will go in.  All in all, this has been a great purchase for me.Update:  I just installed a second JetDrive 420 (240) in my wife's MacBook 6.1.  I again used CCC to clone the existing hard drive, followed the procedure in the Transcend video; it worked like a charm.  Several times since, my wife has said how happy she is with the change; much quicker app loading and data retrieval.  These are, based on my experience to date, great products."", 'Apple Genius suggested I get a new SSD and more RAM (crucial.com has the best RAM prices) for my old, sluggish mid 2010 Mac Pro with i7 Processor  running on Yosemite. The i7 is considered ""high end"" and now reserved for ""special orders"" according to the Genius, and why Apple uses i5 on floor products.Chose the JetDrive 420 based on my brother\'s recommendation (he bought one last year) and the reviews.  I am totally AMAZED at how FAST and FLAWLESSLY my MBP is now performing - From starting up, downloading, uploading and emailing etc.  WOW!  My old MBP has transformed from a tortoise into a cheetah!The 2 minute installation video attached to this product is insufficient. Here\'s a lengthier (6 min) video which is much more instructional and useful (note the screws):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hRAcscfgRgI was unable to transfer the data from my HDD to the Jetdrive via Disk Utility.  Took Eric\'s advice (an earlier reviewer experiencing similar problems) and cloned using super duper (free software). Total transfer time took about 3 hours.  Rest of the hardware installation was a breeze!Thanks Transcend!']"

Aproveché para hacerlo en el momento en que la batería ha dado problemas para no tener que abrirlo dos veces y creo que debía haberlo hecho mucho antes. No sólo he aumentado la capacidad del disco sino que se han incrementado la velocidad y rendimiento del ordenador. Además ahora tengo un disco duro externo de pequeño tamaño y capacidad aceptable que también es muy rápido (se aprovecha el antiguo ssd como disco duro externo en la carcasa que viene con el kit.La instalación es muy sencilla y viene bien detallada en el propio folleto del kit. Además, hay muchos tutoriales de facil acceso (con poner el modelo de ordenador y cambio de ssd en google ya encuentras unos cuantos). En cualquier caso lleva pocos pasos. en primer lugar si quieres conservar el estado actual de tu ordenador (instalación, programas, archivos), debes comenzar por una copia del disco duro. ha que montar el ssd nuevo en la carcasa (son tres tornillos Torx, con el destornillador T5 incluido y el ssd se inserta en el adaptador de la caja), conectarlo por usb al ordenador y arrancar en modo recuperación (pulsando Cmd + R), es un arranque con las herramientas de utilidad de disco habilitadas que permite formatear el nuevo ssd (dando el formato correspondiente a nuestro disco duro) y hacer una copia del antiguo disco duro en este. Despúes de apagar el ordenador y de volver a sacar el nuevo ssd de la carcasa, hay que abrir el portatil. Se quitan los 10 tornillos de la carcasas trasera con el destornillador P5 para los famosos (y algo odiosos) tornillos pentalobulados de apple y es mejor colocarlos en algún lugar recordando la posición (no todos son iguales, 8 son cortos de 2.5mm y 2, los pegados a la pantalla son más largos, de 8mm). Una vez dentro, hay un par de cosas importantes: aunque evidentementa hay que hacerlo todo con el ordenador completamente apagado y sin conexión a corriente, hay que desconectar la batería (en mi caso como iba a cambiarla al mismo tiempo, lo primero que hice fue retirar la batería vieja). Hay una pequeña lengüeta (segñun el modelo de ordenador a veces es de otra forma) de la que tirar para desconectar sin hacer destrozos... Antes de quitar el ssd original hay que recordar que está sujeto por un tornillo que sale facilmente con el destornillador T5 incluido. Con eso ya simplemente es tirar con cuidado del antiguo ssd, introducir el nuevo con el mismo cuidado, volver a poner el tornillo T5, reconectar la bateria y volver a a atornillar la caracasa. Antes de esto último, en función de la antiguedad, uso y estado del ordenador puede ser recomendable usar un aspirador de mano que quite pelusas y otras suciedades del interior del ordenador si las hay. El ssd viejo se puede introducir en la carcasa que viene y usarlo como disco externo, va muy rápido. Por último, en la página de transcend se puede encontrar un software gratuito, ""jetdrive toolbox"" que optimiza el uso del disco duro y permite habilitar el soprte TRIM de este nuevo SSD.Estoy feliz con  este nuevo disco duro (y con el uso del antiguo) que ha aumentado la capacidad del ordenador y además ha mejorado la velocidad y el rendimiento de mi macbook air, creo que tengo para unos cuantos años más sin cambiar de ordenador. La única pega que le puedo poner es que el precio es elevado (yo me compré el de más capacidad), pero lo cierto es que es un precio acorde a lo que ofrece.', 'Da beim MBA (11"", Late 2010) meiner Frau nur mehr 5GB der originalen 128GB frei waren, war es allerhöchste Zeit für eine Aufrüstung.Das neue JetDrive war daher eine willkommene Alternative zur teureren OWC Aura.Die positiven Dinge zuerst:- hübsche Verpackung (Apple-inspiriert)- das USB Case passt gut zum MacBook Air, ist gut verarbeitet und greift sich hochwertig an- das Klonen der alten SSD und der Einbau der neuen SSD waren kinderleicht und komplikationsfrei zu bewältigen (""Kai S."" hat dazu in seiner Kritik bereits eine perfekte Anleitung geschrieben, daher wiederhole ich das hier nicht)- meine Frau hat nun wieder viel Platz auf Ihrem MBADie nicht ganz perfekten Dinge:- die alte SSD (in diesem Fall eine Toshiba mit 128GB) passt nicht so perfekt in das USB Case wie die Transcend (da die Chips anscheinend um Millimeter anders angeordnet sind, sitzt einer der inneren Gummidämpfer nun auf und nicht neben einem der Chips, weshalb sanfte Gewalt notwendig ist, um das Case zuzuschrauben)- die von Transcend downloadbare Software behauptet, TRIM wäre aktiviert; die Mac Systemeigenschaften behaupten das Gegenteil; der Versuch, TRIM über die Transcend Software zu deaktivieren, um es danach neu zu aktivieren, resultiert in einer Fehlermeldung; ich mußte TRIM daher manuell über die Konsole aktivieren (notwendige Befehle findet man über Google)- die alte SSD im USB Case funktioniert nicht an allen Geräten zuverlässig an USB 2, hier muß ich mir wohl noch ein Splitkabel zur zusätzlichen Stromversorgung über einen zweiten Port kaufenUnd zuletzt die negative Überraschung: die Performance (Achtung: siehe Korrekturen am Ende der Kritik!)Die originale SSD (wie schon geschrieben von Toshiba, also die langsamere ausgelieferte Variante) hat zuletzt Werte von rund 185/165 MB/s R/W geliefert (115GB von eff. 120GB belegt, verschlüsselt).Da dies unter den Möglichkeiten des MBA liegt (wie die ebenfalls herstellerseitig verfügbare Samsung beweist), und Transcend höhere Werte angibt, hätte ich mir hier eine Verbesserung erwartet.Daher war es überraschend, das nach dem Einbau keine besseren Werte erreicht wurden.Ganz schlimm wurde es nach dem Aktivieren der Verschlüsselung.Mit gerade einmal 135/120 MB/s R/W ist die Transcend damit deutlich langsamer als die original verbaute Toshiba (die nur die halbe Kapazität hatte, und zu 95% zugemüllt war - also nicht die besten Voraussetzungen für gute Write-Werte hatte).Das ist natürlich enorm enttäuschend.Die Performance der alten SSD im USB Case auf USB 3.0 ist minimal schlechter als intern im MBA. Der Controller wird als ASMedia identifiziert, leider ohne Produktnummer.Die etwas schlechtere Performance ist vermutlich auf das Fehlen von UASP zurückzuführen - das muß ich aber noch gesondert verifizieren.Unterm Strich also eine günstige Speicher-Erweiterung, aber leider nicht perfekt.____________________Korrekturen:Das USB Case wird unter Windows als SCSI Device erkannt, unterstützt also UASP.Nach dem Firmware-Update (Firmware von Mai, ausgeliefert wurde eine Version von April) erreiche ich ohne Verschlüsselung eine R/W Performance von 270/210 MB/s. Das ist sehr in Ordnung. Auch die Performance mit Verschlüsselung ist gestiegen, und liegt jetzt immerhin bei rund 180/160 MB/s - da dies dem Wert mit der alten Festplatte entspricht, gehe ich davon aus, dass ab dieser Geschwindigkeit der Prozessor limitiert.', 'Ich habe mit dieser Variante meine werkseitige 64 GB - SSD ersetzt, um einfach mehr Speicherplatz für Programme und Musik zu erhalten.Der (hardwareseitige) Einbau war mit Hilfe der Anleitung eigentlich problemlos möglich. Jedoch trat bei der anzufertigenden Kopie der originalen SSD bereits das erste Problem auf, welches mit Yosemite zusammen hängt: Entgegen der Anleitung ist es nicht möglich, mit der ""Option"" (also ""alt"")-Taste zum Festplattendienstprogramm zu gelangen, welches für das problemlose Klonen der originalen SSD notwendig ist. Ein Blick auf die Internet-Seite des Herstellers unter ""FAQ"" half - es ist über die Tastenkombination cmd + ""R"" beim Start zu erreichen. Über diesen Weg kann man der Anleitung folgend, die SSD klonen.Nach dem Einbau und des festlegen des (neuen) Volumen als Startvolumen, lief die SSD problemlos. Nach dem Herunterladen der Software ""JetDrive Toolbox"" musste ich jedoch feststellen, dass es nicht möglich ist die Trim-Funktion zu aktivieren.Nach einiger Recherche im Netz musste ich feststellen, dass auch dieses mit Yosemite zusammenhängt - Apple hat mit Yosemite offenbar die Sicherheitsrichtlinien so verändert, dass es Dritthersteller nicht möglich ist, die Trim-Funktion zu aktivieren.Dies ist offenbar nur durch Tools möglich. Ich habe einiges über diese Tools (z. B. Trim Enabler) gelesen und empfehle unbedingt, vor dem Einsatz eines solchen Tools sich ebenfalls über die möglichen Konsequenzen (von Richtlinienverstößen bis hin zur Gefahr, dass der Mac irgendwann nicht mehr startet...) kundig macht und abwägt.Ich habe mich entschieden, die Funktion nicht zu aktivieren. Wie einige Seiten dargelegt haben, ist der Geschwindigkeitsunterschied eher zu vernachlässigen. Das angeblich unzureichende Löschproblem soll auch bei den modernen SSD zu vernachlässigen sein.Dies muss aber jeder für sich entscheiden. Da es viele Seiten zu dieser Thematik gibt, gebe ich nur den Hinweis auf eine Seite, die ich besonders interessant und hilfreich fand. Auch diese verweist weiter: [...]Da tiefgreifende Erklärungen zur Trim-Funktionen den Rahmen hier sprengen würden, möchte ich auf Wikipedia verweisen - dort findet man eine Menge Hintergrundwissen.Nun läuft meine Platte ohne Trim, aber ich merke keinen Performance-Unterschied. Ich hoffe, dass die SSD lange durchhält und ich dadurch die mögliche Nutzungsdauer meines MacBooks erheblich verlängert habe.Nach der fertigen Installation empfehle ich das Update auf die neuste Firmware. Diese findet man ebenfalls auf der Herstellerseite.4 Sterne vergebe ich auf Grund der mangelhaften Yosemite-Unterstützung. Hier hätte ich vom Hersteller einen deutlicheren Hinweis auf die Probleme erwartet.5 Sterne wäre sie aber bei vollständiger Unterstützung wert.', 'I just finished installing this drive a couple hours ago in my mid-2011 MacBook Air 11"". It upgraded by measly 128GB to 960GB and has dramatically increased the speed of the computer as well. It\'s like breathing new life into a 3-1/2 year old computer. Installation was brain-dead simple. I watched the Transcend video on YouTube before hand, and then again while I was doing the work. I was really impressed with how easy the entire process was, especially because I know how hard it is on a PC. Between Apple\'s good recovery software (used for copying the drives) and Transcend\'s end-to-end thinking, I don\'t know why anyone couldn\'t do it themselves. (Okay, you do need eyesight and finger dexterity to handle the super tiny screws, but other than that...)  Before I bought, i used Transcend\'s charts for figuring out exactly which generation of MacBook Air I had, and for determining which of their models would work well in it. That was simple, and then i ordered the drive. I loved that the product came with a case for putting the old SSD into so it will have a new life as an external hard disk, but once I began the process, I realized how useful it was in just the upgrade process. It took 5 minutes to get the new drive attached externally to the Mac, and start Apple\'s recovery process to clone the existing drive onto the new Transcend SSD. My existing drive had been encrypted with FileVault. I had read there were concerns about FileVault and needing to manually disable it and unencrypt the drive before upgrading, however, that was not the case. (Perhaps it was with earlier versions of OS X, but with 10.10 Yosemite, it was not necessary.) I simply entered my admin password and the recovery tools unlocked the drive and allowed me to clone it. It took 1 hour 47 minutes to clone the drive (I had 100GB filled on the 128GB drive). When that was done, it took 15 leisurely minutes to remove the new drive from the external housing, remove the old SSD from the Mac, and swap them. (I took an extra 10 minutes to use compressed air to blow out the insides of my Mac and a q-tip with alcohol to clean the air vents, and around the edges. The results were a PC interior that looked brand new.) After booting the Mac for the first time with the new SSD, it took almost 60 seconds to get to the Apple logo boot screen. That must have been a first-time thing, because all further reboots were lighting fast--much faster than with the old SSD. I then started the FileVault encryption processes again, and that took about an hour to re-encrypt the new drive. I was so excited, i kept up the cleaning process and wiped the keyboard, outside and screen down. The Mac looks brand new now. And it runs like a charm. How is it possible that I love my 3.5 year old computer so much?I only wish I had done this a year sooner.', ""Well packaged product includes everything needed to swap the SSD. In my case it was an old 2010 MacBook Air running Yosemite. I was moving from 240 to 960 Gb.Instead of using Drive Manager to clone the original disk, I used Carbon Copy Cloner. Main reason is that it handles any errors better and I did find a few during the copy.I should point out that the old MacBook is only USB 2.0 so the copy took a couple of hours.I then tried a reboot from the new cloned SSD before I opened the machine. (Hold option key during restart and select the relevant disk). It worked fine - surprising me slightly because it was across the USB connection.Then shutdown and selecting the correct supplied screwdriver tor gently open the back. TIP:  I also arranged the screws in a square matching their original location for replacement.The inside of the 4 year old macbook was really clean!! Otherwise I'd have cleaned it.One screw to undo to remove the old SSD and put in the new one - note a different supplied screwdriver for this singe screw.Replace the back.Option R reboot to change the boot disk to the new one. Rename the new disk to Macintosh HD.Yay - it all works and I've now got 960Gb of disk with 824Gb still available. AND I've still got the original drive now in a neat little (supplied) enclosure....Something else...TRIM Support - a facility to optimise SSD garbage collection. Stop reading here if this all seems like Martian.Since Yosemite, TRIM support isn't directly available for non Apple SSDs except via a utility called TRIM Enabler. Apple don't allow non certified kernel extensions.You know what. I don't care.I've now got so much space and enough left over for garbage collection that the TRIM optimisations pale into insignificance. Frankly, the SSD can outrun other 2010 MacBook disk electronics in any case so it is somewhat academic.I have anyway bought the $10 Trim Enabler which includes SMART diagnostics and if I ever need to, I'd switch TRIM on for a day to let space be reclaimed, but I don't envisage doing that for a long time.So all in all. A super upgrade for a sensible price."", 'Note that I just finished installing this SSD, so my review can only cover the ease of installation and not the longevity of the product -- that said, if any issues arise in the future, I will update my review.Now, for what is so fantastic about this ... I ordered the JetDrive 500 960GB SSD for my MacBook Air 4,2 (mid-2011) ... there is some conflicting info about whether or not the 960GB works for the MacBook Air, but it does ... go to the Transcend website and/or email them directly if you have any questions.Basically, I now have a new computer for a fraction of the cost of replacing my MacBook Air, with quadruple the storage it had and double the max storage available on any new MacBook Air!  I am over the moon - no more shuffling files from my computer to an external hard drive and backing up multiple hard drives and worrying if I\'m approaching my max limit (yet again) ... I have nearly a terabyte of internal storage!  How amazing is that?!The INSTALLATION was pretty darn easy ... I agree w/ others\' assessment that the quick install guide included w/ the drive is useless (and a waste of paper), but the online video is spot on ... it seems too easy to believe, but when you finish installing, you will be a believer!  The most laborious and time-consuming aspect is cloning the existing drive.  Like some other people, I wound up having to install the free 30-day trial version of Carbon Copy Cloner b/c the built-in Mac disk utility wasn\'t up to the task (if you have a corrupt file, it will arrest the cloning process rather than skip the file and continue cloning uncorrupted files - this is pretty infuriating if it doesn\'t encounter the corruption until 2 hours into the clone ... CCC will skip the corrupt files and tell you what they are and continue cloning your drive).  This, however, has absolutely nothing to do w/ Transcend.So once you get the drive cloned, on to opening up the MacBook Air and swapping out the SSDs ... OMG so EASY!  Just like the video!  I also used some canned air to blow out some of the accumulated dust inside the case, swapped out the drives, slapped the back on, booted up and VOILA!  My computer and all my files were there and lightning fast!One caveat, a few passwords and keys needed to be re-entered ... so far, I only needed to sign back into Dropbox and I had to re-enter my Office for Mac product key, so make sure you have those things handy, if need be.  I also did a backup before embarking on this whole process, just in case.BUT HONESTLY, BOTTOM LINE - I HAVE A ""NEW"" COMPUTER!!!!!!!!!  I am so excited!!!!  Thank you, Transcend!!!!!!!!!', 'My 2011 MacBook Air only has 64GB SSD. I had to be very careful in saving files and installing Apps, it had been a pain to use. I don\'t want to buy another macbook because it is just too expensive.Very pleased to find this one. Put it on, so far so good, hope it last. I will follow-up if I have any problem with it.The package provides everything you need to replace the SSD, including the right screwdrivers to open up Macbook Air, and instructions.Make sure you restore (duplicate) the original SSD to this one before put it on, it is in the instruction sheet.The installation is very straight forward, most people can do it,You may watch this Youtube video to see how to replace SSD:[...]Prop: Provide the enclosure so that you can utilize the replaced SSD as external drive, comes with the screwdrivers, and instructions.Cons: The instruction sheet is very small, it is hard to read. The SSD seems a little slower in boot up compared to the Apple original.Note: If you had upgraded your MBA to OS X Yosemite, don\'t press ""Option"" key, as instructed in the instruction sheet from the drive, to arise disk utility for restoring SSD. Instead, you need to press ""Command"" and ""R"" keys to arise, then you may follow the steps in the instruction sheet to restore SSD before put it on. It took me a while to figure out.Three months follow-up: It had been in my MBA for 3 month, with roughly 1~4 hr /day use, on and off, I had used up 100GB space. No issue at all, my MBA is as fast as when it was new. Definitely recommend to anyone! I still keep my old SSD just in case. But with the provided enclosure, it can be turned into a 64GB USB 3.0 external drive.(Update: May 2016), still working like a champ! Never had problem! Use my Mac everyday.(Update: Aug 2017), after 2 and a half year, it is still working like a champ. Not a single issue at all. Great quality product!(Update: Aug 2018), after 3 and a half year, it is still working like a champ. Not a single issue at all. Great quality product! Too bad for Apple that I don\'t need to replace my MacBook Air w/ this SSD update!', 'Ich beginne meinen Bericht am besten mit einem heftigen Übersetzungsfehler im deutschen Teil der Anleitung, der dem nicht gar so versierten Mac-User die Installation unmöglich macht: Auf Seite 4 steht, man müsse »Strg+R« gedrückt halten, um in das Startup-Disk-Menü zu gelangen. Das ist falsch bzw. könnte man leicht als Ctrl+r interpretieren. Man muss vielmehr Cmdl+r gedrückt halten.Zweite Hürde ist dann u.U. das Festplatten-Dienstprogramm: Das Löschen und Formatieren des JetDrives funktionierte bei meinem Macbook Air Mitte 2011 (MacOS Sierra 10.12.5) erst im zweiten Anlauf. Beim ersten, identischen Versuch wurde der Vorgang mit einer Fehlermeldung abgebrochen. Also ggf. einfach wiederholen.Der Preis des Sets ist für eine 240-GB-SSD auf den ersten Blick sehr hoch, aber ich finde, der relativiert sich schnell. Man bekommt (bis auf den o.g. Übersetzungsfehler) eine narrensichere Anleitung, das passende Werkzeug für die OP und hat am Ende ja auch noch seine »alte« SSD als externes Speichermedium in einem schlanken Gehäuse. Diesen Vorteil sollte man m. E. nicht unterschätzen, denn das Mounten, Lesen und Schreiben der neuen »USB-SSD« ist deutlich schneller als bei einem normalen USB-Stick.Nach dem Einbau des JetDrive kann der erste Systemstart des Macbooks übrigens etwas länger dauern als üblich. Ansonsten habe ich den Eindruck, dass das Starten jetzt schneller geht, doch das kann natürlich täuschen. Im täglichen Gebrauch spüre ich keinen Speed-Zuwachs.Fazit: Den Bock in der Anleitung hatte ich sofort bemerkt und ansonsten fluppte das Upgrade meines Macbooks tadellos. Mehr Speicher, keine Beschaffungskriminalität in Sachen Feinmechanikerwerkzeug, eine flinke externe USB-Platte on top – ich bin bestens zufrieden!', ""Had to order a replacement ssd drive for my 2010 macbook air as the drive in mine failed during an OSX update :( This was the best bet to get anything in Canada reasonably quickly - but ouch did I pay for it. This kit is pretty much 2x the price of the same thing in the US.Price aside, the kit itself is excellent - it comes complete with the two screwdrivers you need, and a usb powered aluminium hard drive caddy you can put the old drive into.New ssd was super simple to fit, took maybe 10 minutes. My fun and games began thereafter, as the whole idea of the caddy is you can use the old drive to re-install the OS and retreive your data etc. I didn't have that option with the old drive dead so it took me another hour or so to find a recovery image, and install it from a usb stick.As far as this drive kit goes though, if you need a replacement for an older macbook air in canada, fairly quickly, this is the best option I could find. Its good quality, and has everything you need in the box to replace your old drive.""]"

Akhbari), namely, ""once I try to restore into the new hard drive, the restore utility errors out with Input/Output Error"".  I contacted Transcend and received the same feedback he receive: check connections or the error is due to your old drive (which tested fine).I found a work around after I determined the true cause of the problem:  the enclosure is a USB 3.0 and the port on the laptop is a USB 2.0.Here is what I did to reach this conclusion:- I attached the enclosure with the Transcend JetDrive to a new MacBookPro (USB 3.0) and was able to clone its built in drive onto the JetDrive with no problem. So that confirmed the JetDrive and its enclosure/cable are ok.- I attached an external drive (USB 2.0) to the MacBookAir and was able to clone the internal drive onto it with no problem.  So that confirmed the internal drive on the MacBookAir and the USB port are ok.- I attached the JetDrive to the MacBookAir and attempted to clone the internal drive using Carbon Copy Cloner.  After copying 1 GB, Carbon Copy Cloner failed with a problem with the “destination” drive, i.e., the JetDrive. But we know the drive is ok.So I noticed that the only combination that failed is the USB 3.0 drive connecting to the USB 2.0 port.  Not sure what caused the failure, whether it is a driver causing data under run, or the actual physical connection at the port.  But the failures (which I reproduced multiple times) occurred around the 1 GB data transfer threshold.  This leads me to think it was a software/firmware issue. I know a 3.0 drive should be compatible with a 2.0 port, but the internet has many examples of people having this issue.Here is the work around I used:-I attached the enclosure to my MacBook Pro and installed MacOSX on it.  This gave me the added bonus of installing an OSX recovery partition on the Jetdrive.-I installed the Jetdrive in the Macbook aIr and then restored my files on the Jetdrive from my (USB 2.0)  backup drive.Everything is working fine now.  Just too many hours of debugging.', 'I bought this to upgrade my Mid 2011 13"" Macbook Air with OS 10.13.6 installed. I got it to work, and it works great. But the instructions did not work at all. The way I did it was:-Back up Macbook to Time Machine, or similar backup.-Did the instructions up through reformat/erase the new SSD drive.-Installed the new drive in the laptop-Start laptop and let the OS go into a wifi recovery mode and then install a backup of the laptop from a Time Machine copy on my external HD (or similar backup device).I could not get the new SSD to make a mirror image of the laptop memory using the instructions. It said to select ""container disk 2"" to restore to, and mine was greyed out. All other options failed. I ended up doing the above mentioned steps and it works great. I wasted a lot of time trying to do it by the instructions.Once I got the new SSD working in the laptop I could not get the laptop to erase and reformat the JetDrive with the old SSD installed as an external drive. I had to go to my Mac Desktop (a different newer computer) and run the Disk Utility to get it to erase and reformat. After all that, it works great. The new SSD memory definitely works and is somewhat faster than the old memory. My main reason for the upgrade was for capacity (120GB to 500GB), and it does that just fine. Once I got the external JetDrive to work with the old memory its a nice to have an external drive that is really fast compared to a regular thumb drive.They need to update the directions to something that actually works. Otherwise a great upgrade that will keep my 9 year old laptop going for a few more years.', 'I let this bad boy sit on my table for a few weeks while I mustered the courage to deal with it, and finished a project that was putting some cheddar in mah pocket.I studied and re-studied the video on the site with the repetitive background music. I looked closely at other Amazon reviews. And yesterday, I dove in. It took me longer than I thought it would, but I got it done, son!Glitch Area #1: Cloning the drive. I experienced immediate issues, as others have. Furthermore I never had encryption turned on. And so I went rogue. I downloaded MacOS Sierra (current as of this review but not for much longer) onto the JetDrive, and then automagically was prompted if I wanted to move my apps, files and settings ONTO the JetDrive. Hell yes! Fast forward 90 minutes or so and it was perfect.Glitch Area #2: The screws, man. Those puppies are teeny and I\'ve always had trembling hands. Everything was fine until it came time to put the screws back onto the cover. I was about to give up and call a local repair dude, but I went back for one more try -- randomly loosely screwing in one, and then another on the opposite side...and so on....The last screw? I lost it. But that\'s easy enough. I was going to buy a replacement set here on Amazon. And then when I went to plug my mid-2011 MacBook Air back in, I couldn\'t insert the cord. At first I thought the case was off kilter. And then it hit me. The missing screw was literally shoved inside the jack. Five minutes later and I was done.At 480 GB I now have nearly double the capacity. Everything is working perfectly. I couldn\'t be more happy. And as others have suggested, buying and using ""Trim Enabler"" is a good idea.One other suggestion: Your life will be a lot easier if you use Dropbox (or a similar service) and have everything living under your Dropbox folder. Then you can selectively unsync the majority of your stuff prior to the cloning process. Once you\'re on the other side of the installation and know you are safe and good to go, you can selectively resync your files. Sure, this means more time on the back end....but it IS the back end during which time you\'ll have a fully operational MacBook. I did this and in the wee hours of the early morning my baby was napping peacefully.', ""I wish the price for this SSD is lower or comparable to the 2.5 SSD of equal capacity.  But at the same time, I'm thankful to Transcend for producing a quality SSD for the 2011 Macbook Air.  I've read too many negative reviews from their only competition.  I decided to go with Transcend because of the positive reviews online and the ease of installation with clear instructions complete with video.  They didn't disappoint me.  The installation instruction was straightforward and everything went smoothly.  The hardest part was waiting for the clone/restore to finish.  It took 4 hours to clone a 256 GB drive via my 2011 Macbook Air's USB 2.0 port.  I actually bought a Kanex KTU20 thunderbolt to USB3 adapter but I thought I ran into a problem.  My MBA wouldn't recognize the Transcend external drive.  I later realized that I had to plug in the external drive to the USB 3 port on the adapter before plugging in the thunderbolt connector to the MBA.  By the time I realized what I did wrong, it was already too late because the clone/restore already started.  Anyway, after the cloning process was finished, I swapped out the original SSD with the new one.  The screws securing the bottom of the MBA are really tiny so I used a little bit of blue loctite to make sure they stay put.  They actually had blue loctite on them when I took them out.  Once everything was in place, my MBA fired right up just as it always did before.  Everything was the same except the SSD capacity has doubled.  So far, so good.  I haven't encountered any problems with the new SSD.  The old one fit right into the external enclosure.  One reviewer complained about the external enclosure's screws not going in smoothly.  The screws on mine went in without any problems.  The only thing I need to do is to open it up again and add some padding around the original Toshiba SSD.  There's a little bit of space in between the upper half oft the enclosure that causes it to rattle inside a bit.  Other than that, I'm happy with the Transcend JetDrive 500 480 GB SSD and would be happy to recommend it to anyone looking to extend the life of their Macbook Air."", 'This upgrade has transformed my 2011 MacBook Air 13"".I made the mistake of buying my MacBook Air with the 120GB SSD.  It quickly filled up with photos and music and after 3 years I was in serious trouble.  I was initially afraid to try this upgrade -- intimidated by Apple\'s statements that the Air couldn\'t be upgraded and frightened by the tiny screws on the Air\'s base plate.  My local computer repair place said they could do the upgrade for $ 100 if I purchased the drive myself.I researched the Transcend drive and the competing OWC.  I read reviews on Amazon and on several forums.  I also watched YouTube videos on how to do the upgrades.Upgrading is much easier than I thought it would be. Transcend\'s videos and brief instructions are excellent.First, it was easy to install the Transcend SSD in the enclosure provided.  Formatting and copying contents from my Mac to the Transcend SSD using OS X Disk Utility is as easy as anything else on a Mac.  It did take over an hour.Second, removing my old drive and installing the Transcend with the screw drivers they included was really simple.  Unscrew the base plate.  Disconnect the battery. Remove one screw on the drive.  Install the new drive.  Screw it down.  Connect the battery.  Put the base plate back on.  The only thing I had to stress about through the whole process was potentially dropping Apple\'s sesame-seed sized screws -- which didn\'t happen.Third, my Mac booted up normally -- no worries.  I downloaded and installed the Transcend utility to activate drive trim.I noticed that Apps and Files load much faster -- especially ones that access lots of disk like iTunes.  I have 4 times as much drive capacity as I had before and my Mac runs much faster.I put my old drive into the Transcend enclosure and erased it after taking a week or after making sure the Transcend worked.  Now I have a spare 120GB SSD drive that I use to backup photos & documents.  It\'s smaller than an external HDD, bigger than a USB thumb drive, but pretty useful.', 'I purchased the 240 GB model to upgrade the 120 GB I had stock in my late 2012 MBP. The quality of the packaging as well as the build quality of the metal enclosure surpassed my expectations and seemed well worth the price that was paid.I would say that the quick installation guide they provide in the package is inadequate to really help but I suppose that\'s why it\'s ""quick"". It seems very dangerous to me, though, that they would include very rough directions for as delicate as an operation as swapping out an SSD. I would recommend to everyone that you watch the Transcend JetDrive replacement video once or twice AND have it pulled up on your phone or secondary computer so you can follow it as you go along. It can be found at the bottom of the Transcend page (http://us.transcend-info.com/apple/jetdrive/).In addition, even their own instructions only give you the big picture but don\'t deal with the subtle nuances that come with taking your computer apart. Here are a few of my notations and additional instructions that would serve you well for swapping out your drive.1). Lay down a cloth under your MBP to prevent scratches to the top.2). Get a small bowl or use the packaging to hold all of your TINY TINY screws.3). The back will be more difficult to remove than is implied by the video. It is adhered in several spots. You will need to lift one corner up and work it around gently pulling it up. You\'ll hear it pop softly as it comes loose at each point.4). There are two types of screws that adhere the back to the body, short screws and long screws. There are two short screws and they go in the two spots in the middle on the hinge side. My explanation is poor but just pay attention when you remove them and you\'ll see what I mean.Those are all the ""gotchas"" I can think of at the moment. After installing the SSD and booting up it took a little longer than expected to boot but after a couple reboots it seems to have worked itself out.Now for an actual review, I just installed the drive yesterday and it seems to be working like a champ. I forgot to benchmark before but my after benchmark using Geekbench 3 is at least on par with the other Late 2012 MBP so I don\'t think it hurt. Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase and consider it worth the ~$180 in order not to lug around an external SSD just to run Windows as a VM. That solution would also have been slower so I\'d say this is a great deal in all regards.', 'I had only ever opened the back of my mid 2011 MacBook Air once, to install a new battery a year ago; that empowered me (60 year old and not technologically inclined) to try replacing my 120GB Hard Drive after a couple of years of storage problems. I ordered my JetDrive 500 after reading all the reviews and watching the Transcend You Tube video of the installation process. I was prepared to have to deal with hitting a snag, but thought I would give it a try. I would never have done so if Transcend had not made the video on installation. I also read that a few people reported increased operating speed after installation, although Transcend said it should be the same. I went through the process yesterday and encountered no problems at all, although anyone should allow at last 3 hours to complete the process. My hard drive was almost full and the transfer to the JetDrive 500 took more than 2 hours but I was expecting that and could monitor the progress.I am extremely impressed with the thoughtfully designed packaging that enabled me to handle the drive whilst barely touching it and instructions that enabled an idiot like me to replace it myself! Today I erased my old internal hard drive, I love that you can us the provided case to turn it into an external hard drive, very handy. Oh and for me there is a big difference in speed, easily twice as fast as before. I wish I had done this a year ago, memory problems solved and now I can go back to storing video on my laptop again!', 'When I bought my 13 inch Macbook Pro Retina in December of 2012 It had barely been on the market for two months. Imagine my reaction when less than two months later they slashed the price by $200 for the 128GB SSD model. Furthermore, I immediately realized that the 128GB SSD was not going to be able to accommodate my storage needs for the long term.I went to the Apple store to see if I could trade the machine for one with a 256GB drive, and found that: 1. I was just outside the period of time Apple allows for such trade-ups, and 2. The drive was connected directly to the motherboard and it could not be upgraded (or so the Apple guys said).I was miffed to say the least, having spent over $4000.00 on two MacBooks and peripherals. After a few months I began having to remove photos, music, and other data and applications. Then one day I came upon an article in 9 to 5 Mac, describing how Transcend had developed a solution to those who wanted to increase the storage in the Retina MacBooks. The article included a couple of YouTube videos showing how to install the new drive into the MacBook. After watching the videos I could see how simple it was to upgrade my machine.There was a link to Amazon, and they had the best price I also ordered the special tools needed to crack the case and remove the old drive. I discovered that was unnecessary as Transcend included both tools with the drive. The  written documentation was very poor so I went by the videos provided on their website.The first step was to clone the information from the old SSD to the new drive. The video demonstration was excellent and in about 20 minutes I cloned the new drive. After, I set about swapping the drive, again I first watched the video, then simply followed the directions.The whole process took barely more than one hour, and the new drive works great. Now I have plenty of room for my music and pictures. I feel like I have a new computer. One caveat: If your machine is still under warranty, modifying the MacBook in any way will void your warranty, so think carefully before embarking on this project.', 'My daughter\'s mid-2011 Macbook Air was reaching its 128 Gb capacity as she filled it with hi-res photos and videos. I read reviews of the other storage upgrade for Macs and was disturbed by reports of the Sad Mac Face. My daughter was going off to college and I couldn\'t risk an angry late night call ""Dad! My computer won\'t start! What did you do to it!""I ordered the Transcend JetDrive 500 to increase the storage from 128GB to 480. I made sure we backed up everything TWICE and then got to it.Transcend provided the pentalobe and torx tools. The back of the Macbook Air was extremely easy to open (I cleaned out the insides while I was there). Removing the old drive and inserting the new one was extremely easy. The old drive didn\'t fight me and the new one was a perfect fit. I tripled-checked everything and replaced the back. I went really slow and it took me about 15 minutes.It took an hour or so to clone the old drive. We powered up the Macbook Air for the first time. It came back on just like it usually did. My daughter logged in, clicked a few things, and said, ""Yeah. It looks fine.""She never allowed me to fool with it to see if there was a speed improvement, but if anything had been different or if it acted funny in any way, I would have heard about it. She has had the new drive for 2+ weeks and I don\'t even think she knows that anything has changed - except that she no longer gets warning about the drive being full.I am totally satisfied with the Transcend drive. It was super easy to install and the changed hardware is virtually invisible to my daughter. Five stars!!']"

Hopefully, the S3500 will live up to its stellar reputation, and be a trouble-free primary boot drive and work-horse for my latest internet/streaming, MMORPG/Strategy gaming, and home-office desktop system.I had no trouble installing the SSD into my new desktop configuration (see below), or performing a clean install of Windows 10 on it.My Current System Build:- PHANTEKS Enthoo Evolv mATX Aluminum Case (White) - $129.99- ENERMAX Revolution X\'t ATX 530 Watt Gold-Rated Power Supply (ERX530AWT) - $79.99- GIGABYTE LGA-1151 Intel H110 mATX DDR4 Motherboard (GA-H110M-S2HP) - $76.99- KINGSTON HyperX FURY Black 16GB (2x8GB) 2133MHz DDR4 CL14 Memory (HX421C14FBK2/16) - $96.99- INTEL Core I5-6500 3.20Ghz LGA-1151 Processor - $199.99- EVGA GeForce GTX 960 4GB FTW GAMING ACX 2.0+, Graphics Card (04G-P4-3969-KR) - $184.99- INTEL 240GB SATA 2.5"" SSD (DC S3500 Enterprise Class) - Primary Boot/OS Drive - $159.99- WESTERN DIGITAL 1TB SATA 3.5"" HDD - Secondary Drive - $59.99- WESTERN DIGITAL 500GB SATA 2.5 HDD - Misc.

It has performed fast and flawlessly for the 6 months that I have had it in use.  This still seems to be the available SSD of this size in mSATA format (Samsung makes one but will not sell it direct to consumers).  Note: I understand SSDs at great depth - I previously contracted with 3 SSD manufacturers to write Windows Storport drivers for them (and a BIOS bootrom for one).  SSDs begin to suffer from accelerated flash wear and slower performance (dropping response time by 20x is serious) when they are kept too full (even though the manufacturers over-provision somewhat).  The SSD flash manager then has to move things around to get free pages, with excessive erases and the SSD slows horribly (a page of MLC flash has about ~5K erases before it starts to fail).  The rule is to never allow your SSD to be more than 50% full (Dell marketing does not understand SSDs and does not provide for an SSD of this capacity in their Ultrabooks).', 'Really satisfied with this SSD.

The first drive I received was DOA, so I needed to do an exchange, but amazon is always great about that. So far I\'m satisfied with this drive, however there are a couple things that I find odd:1. The drive is bulky for an SSD; I had to use the bottom screw holes on the drive when mounting it to my Thinkpad W510\'s hard drive tray.2. The max read/write MBps may be overstated as the Windows experience index gives this drive a score of 7.5, whereas other SSDs I\'ve used (all corsair) score 7.9.  Using the Windows command ""winsat diskformal"" I got the following statistics for read performance:> Disk  Sequential 64.0 Read  264.49 MB/s  7.6> Disk  Random 16.0 Read  150.79 MB/s  7.4> Responsiveness: Average IO Rate  0.78 ms/IO  7.9> Responsiveness: Grouped IOs  8.72 units  7.4> Responsiveness: Long IOs  2.20 units  7.9> Responsiveness: Overall  19.14 units  7.8It could be that my Thinkpad W510\'s hard drive controller isn\'t fully taking advantage of the drive, but just thought that I would share my findings/experience.', 'I\'m running 2 of these in RAID-0 on my ASRock Z77 Professional board. I have zero complaints about the product. The build quality seems to be very good and the performance is good over-all. These installed and were set-up without a hitch. The PC is very fast and responsive while running these. Boot-up and shut-down times are excellent. After running various disk performance benchmarks, I\'d say these are good, but not great performing. Obviously, some benchmarks favor certain SSD controllers more than others, so the one that favors the Sandforce makes these seem lightning fast, but the ones that show more ""real world"" performance show these as a bit more average (of performance oriented drives). With that said though, the price point was great and they seem like a solid drive. Again, I have no complaints as they run great.I will upload screenshots of various disk benchmarks (so please see the user submitted photos).', ""Excellent drive!  Windows XP Pro SP 3 was able to initialize, partition and format the drive just fine with the older mobo drive controller on my MSI KAG Neo 2 mobo installed, as is, from the factory with no BIOS flash upgrade or overclocking enabled.  It does all of this with a plain vanilla-flavored MSI BIOS.  It's been running fine now for over a year.Research on this drive shows it has the professional grade buffers and drive writers used in their military grade and server grade SSDs.  The price is reasonable and it makes a great C drive.  All my data is on D anyway, so I don't need a ton of space.  Really the only reason for 120Gigs is to give some breathing room for Windows virtual memory management and for temp folders created by various programs.  Otherwise, Windows XP SP3 doesn't take much room at all, less than 30G.  Even with Pinnacle's Studio 13 Platinum fully loaded with all the accessory plug-ins (a 10 disc set), I'm only using about 40% of the drive space.  Considering that Pinnacle's Studio 13 is a pudgy program, I think I'm doing well.  Edits on the video timeline in Studio 13 are going way faster a smoothly with this SSD under it.Standard platter drives are a thing of the past when installing a new C drive because of the speed and reliability of SSDs.  This drive allows Symantec's Endpoint Protection to run much more quickly than a standard HDD.  A startup scan only takes about 15 minutes now instead of an hour.One word of advice...all manufacturers of SSDs say not to defragment your SSDs, so DON'T, you could mess up the FAT and maybe even the partition.  Older versions of Windows cannot manage defrag of newer SSDs, just like DOS can't really manage CHKDSK real well on big regular drives of today either.  So just don't use it on the Verbatim, or any other SSD.  It's not necessary, really.  Just make sure you format using NTFS file structure to allow maximum file packing management in Windows.

I\'m not sure what\'s up with that since this drive is supposed to be faster than my old drive, but oh well. I took off an star for the lowered performance.

So I grabbed this 120 GB SSD so I can throw Windows 8 on this and Ubuntu 12.10 on the 60 GB SSD. The price was excellent, the product came in the next day thanks to Amazon Prime\'s discounted next-day shipping, and 30 minutes after opening the box I was up and running. The only thing I did\'t like about this was it didn\'t come with a 2.5""-to-3.5"" mounting adapter or a SATA cable, although most drives don\'t come with an extra SATA cable anyway.I already had an SSD installed before, so the speed difference was negligible... but Windows 8 boots in about 4 seconds (after POST) with this drive. (My Ubuntu 12.10 installation on my other SSD boots up instantaneously after reaching the bootloader and selecting the Ubuntu install, and both drives are comparable in speed so if you\'re running Linux you can expect near-instant-on boot times.)

Guardate la foto per giudicare.', ""I've been using SSDs for years now, and I've purchased a few different brands ranging from Samsung Evo models (the most popular) to less well known brands.  This is my first Toshiba branded SSD.In short - this is now the second fastest (by a small margin) SSD that I own, but it is the most expensive per GB.  Construction quality is at least on par with the others, feeling solidly made all around.  It is quite a bit faster than my 850 Evo drives, which are near the bottom of my rankings in terms of speed.  I do have a couple of drives from PNY and Aireye that offer more bang for the buck, but if you prefer Toshiba drives, this one is a solid choice.I've purchased several Samsung Evo drives, including 840 and 850 models (never the Pro models because of the price premium).  I also have drives from PNY, Aireye, and ADATA.  I tend to buy Samsung drives because of my perception of reliability, but they aren't the fastest out there in my testing and usage.  That, and I've never (yet, knock on wood) experienced a failure with any of my SSDs regardless of brand.  The PNY model that I have is the fastest that I've used, with this Toshiba coming in second at (currently) - but the Aireye is nipping at this Toshiba's heels and costs a decent amount less.Regarding speed, let me quantify that for you, and I'm using results from Blackmagic Disk Speed Test because I mostly use Macs at home.  All of these tests were run with the drives in external USB 3.0 enclosures to make it a fair comparison, but your actual speeds will vary some in a different set up:(*)\xa0\nADATA Premier Pro SP920 256GB\n:  Write = 181 MB/s, Read = 374 MB/s(*)\xa0\nSamsung 850 EVO 500GB\n:  Write = 240 MB/s, Read = 246 MB/s(*)\xa0\nAireye 240GB S1\n:  Write = 320 MB/s, Read = 423 MB/s(*) This Drive:  Write = 351 MB/s, Read = 421 MB/s(*)\xa0\nPNY CS2211 480GB\n:  Write = 413 MB/s, Read = 431 MB/sThe ADATA and Samsung are 1 and 2, with one better at Write and the other better at Read.  The Aireye is consistently better than both of those drives in Write and Read, this Toshiba is faster in Write than the Aireye and essentially the same in Read, and the PNY is the fastest (barely beating this at Read, but being almost 20% faster at Write).The other side of the story is price.  Speed is one thing, but is a drive a good value?  Price-wise, as I type this (and SSD prices change pretty often), here's how they stack up for similarly sized drives:(*) Aireye: $78 for 256GB ($0.30/GB) (this is for the newer S2 version that is being sold now, versus the S1 that I own)(*) PNY: $85 for 240GB ($0.35/GB)(*) Samsung: $90 for 250GB ($0.36/GB)(*) ADATA: $93 for 256GB ($0.36/GB)(*) This Drive:  $104 for 256GB ($0.41/GB)So, this performs very well compared to the others, but it's also the most expensive.  Of course, check prices when you're shopping because prices move around, but the speed comparisons should help you out.  After my experiences with Samsung customer service over the past 18 months, I really never want to have to deal with them again.  I think that they make good SSDs, but I don't expect them to ever make good on a warranty claim, so I'm starting to move away from them because of their higher cost and slower speeds.  Only you can decide how you want to approach reliability and the risk of a drive failure.  I just wanted to let you know that this drive is made well and performs extremely well, beating out the 850 Evos but falling short of the PNY Pro Gaming model that I have.""]"

So I bought this kit to speed it up, realising that these days I can get a reasonable capacity SSD at a good price.The kit lets me download and use an Acronis software package for transferring my data from my hard disk to the SSD. My hard disk had C and D partitions. The data in C would have easily fit. However the hard disk uses GPT (GUID Partition Table) format (which from my perspective is just a pain in the ass, but I can't do anything about it). Unfortunately the Acronis software could not understand the format, so it could only copy it bit-wise, and of course that means it would not fit the SSD.Never mind. I downloaded a Windows 10 ISO image from the Microsoft web site, burned it to a DVD, replaced the hard disk with the SSD, and did a fresh install of Windows 10 Home 64-bit. There was no activation problem, just tell it to skip that, and it happily does. Then when it goes online, it figures out that the laptop had Windows before, and activates it, as confirmed in Settings / Update & Security / Activation.As for my data and apps, no problem. All my data was in OneDrive, so I just let it all download again. Because I am using the Files On Demand feature of the Fall Creators Update version of Windows 10, and told it to only download files on demand, that was easy. Then during the night I told it to make all files available locally, which it took a few hours to do, at a time when there were would be no broadband slow-down for me or others.I then installed all my regular apps. As regards drivers, Windows took care of that, as the laptop was nearly 4 years old. No need to re-install all the quirky apps and stuff that came with it. Nice to have a clean fresh install, which makes a lot of problems go away.Altogether, getting the SSD installed and doing the fresh OS install took me 3 hours. After that I did the app installs etc at my leisure.I also tweaked a few things, such as setting Hibernate to Never (for when plugged in) (and left it as after 3 hours, when on battery). (I normally have it powered all the time, so it will be on battery only for the duration of a power cut, which is rare.) Opinions are mixed as to whether avoiding Hibernate is necessary. Personally I believe it is.Since the switch to the SSD, my hard disk, now in the enclosure provided in the kit, has become a convenient 1 TB backup disk for regular weekly backups. And with the SSD, my laptop runs a LOT faster. Reboots are amazing. Task Manager never shows the disk as holding up the machine now. This is the best use of money I have made all year, and I wish I had done it a year or more ago, instead of putting up with the slowness of a hard disk.The kit provided everything I needed. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to speed up their laptop. Just check for compatibility with your laptop first."", 'Ho acquistato questo drive e non me ne pento affatto! Un drive per chi non ha grosse pretese ed è particolarmente attento al prezzo.E poi... se compri un Kingston hai un\'assistenza buona in caso di problemi! ll prodotto è arrivato confezionato in maniera perfetta così come da foto e funziona perfettamente oltre a fare il suo lavoro egregiamente!Per coloro che intendono migrare da un vecchio disco meccanico verso unità di storage più performanti, la strada migliore rimane sempre l\'acquisto di un SSD SATA nonostante l\'arrivo sul mercato di soluzioni tecnologicamente molto più avanzate, sia per motivi economici, vista la drastica riduzione del costo per GB di questa tipologia di drive ma, soprattutto, per la maggiore compatibilità degli stessi con piattaforme non proprio recenti.Se pensiamo che anche i notebook più attuali, ad esclusione di pochi modelli di fascia alta, difficilmente offrono la possibilità di utilizzare i recenti SSD PCIe con interfaccia M.2, ecco spiegato il motivo per cui gli SSD SATA continuano ad essere la prima scelta degli utenti che intendono effettuare l\'upgrade precedentemente menzionato.Uno dei produttori più attenti a questa particolare tipologia di utenti è senza dubbio Kingston Technology che, oltre ad essere il principale produttore indipendente di memorie del mondo, vanta anche un catalogo di SSD tra i più completi in circolazione.La nuova linea SSDNow UV400 di Kingston nasce proprio per soddisfare questa particolare esigenza, offrendo ad un prezzo contenuto prestazioni e robustezza notevolmente superiori rispetto a quelli di un tradizionale hard disk, grazie all\'utilizzo di un controller evoluto come il Marvell 88SS1074 in abbinamento a delle economiche, ma valide, NAND Flash TLC di produzione Toshiba.La nuova linea offre modelli con capacità da 120GB, 240GB, 480GB e 960GB, andando a coprire buona parte dei possibili ambiti di utilizzo, in particolar modo all\'interno delle aziende, dove questo tipo di aggiornamento può ridare linfa vitale ai vecchi sistemi con un notevole risparmio rispetto all\'acquisto di nuovi PC.Il Kingston SSDNow UV400 è inoltre disponibile come drive stand alone o può essere acquistato come kit upgrade, ovvero completo di tutto ciò che occorre per installarlo (adattatore, cavo USB e  software Acronis True Image).Nel corso della recensione odierna andremo ad analizzare nel dettaglio il modello 120G, le cui caratteristiche sono riportate nella tabella sottostante.Modello KINGSTON 120GCapacità 120GBVelocità massima lettura seq. 550 MB/sVelocità max scrittura seq. 500 MB/sInterfaccia SATA IIIController Marvell 88SS1074 -  DRAM Cache DDR3L 256MBTipologia NAND FlashTLC di produzione ToshibaSupporto set di comandi SMART, TRIM, APM, NCQTemperatura operativa 0 °C - 70 °CTemperatura di storage -40 °C - 85 °CDimensioni e peso 100x69,9x7mm - 57gVibrazioni in funzione 2.17G Peak (7-800Hz)Vibrazioni a riposo picco massimo 20G (10-2000Hz)MTBF 1 milione di ore (TBW 200TB)Garanzia 3 anni con servizio di supporto tecnico gratuitoForm Factor 2,5""Consumo energetico 0.672W in standby - 0.693W medio -  0.59W (MAX) lettura -  2.515W (MAX) scrittura', 'I have a Dell Studio PC that I custom ordered in 2009, at which time I upgraded pretty much everything from the base specs.  That was a good move, because going on eight years later it still has no problem doing anything I ask of it and it runs just about constantly.  Lately, however, the eight year-old spinny hard drive had been making more noise than usual, which I have learned (the hard way) can be a sign it\'s about to fail.  I did some research and decided to add an SSD, and I found out my Dell Studio already has a second hard drive bay and the wiring and plugs in place to accept it.  Installation of the Kingston was quick and easy, although I discovered that out of everything that comes with the ""upgrade kit"", the only thing I really needed was the SATA connector.  My PC already had a second data cable and plug coming over from the spinny drive, and it was  hanging loose right where I needed it.  The mounting plate and screws in the kit were unnecessary because the plate would not line up with any mounting holes in the open hard drive bay, but the SSD is so lightweight the data and SATA power cables basically hold it in place in the bay.  In other words, I paid $9 extra for the upgrade kit just to end up using only the SATA cable to connect the SSD to one of the open SATA plugs on the motherboard, but no biggie.  The ""upgrade kit"" also includes a USB enclosure for those who want to use the SSD as an external drive, which I also didn\'t need.Cloning the spinny drive onto the SSD using the included online access to Acronis cloning software download was a problem.  The kit includes a software activation key once the download and installation is complete, but I never made it that far.  After twice downloading the Acronis software as directed and having the installation fail, I went looking elsewhere.  Apparently there is a trial version of Acronis available, but it does not do cloning and will not accept the Kingston activation key to upgrade from the free trial version.  There are several free cloning software downloads out there from other sources, but after reading some reviews I went with Macrium and it worked flawlessly.  The cloning process took about 3.5 hours.  After making sure the cloning was successful, I changed the boot order in the BIOS and made the SSD my primary drive and will now use the old hard drive as a backup.The difference so far is impressive.  My PC now boots and is ready for sign-in in less than ten seconds and is almost silent throughout operation.  I can\'t yet say anything about the long term durability of the Kingston (some reviews report early failures), but so far so good.  The SSD has given my PC new life and I wish I had done this upgrade a long time ago.', ""This was my first SSD, and it's a really solid product. I just want to mention some points:1. Acronis didn't work - I ended up having to download AOMEI Backupper instead.The imaging software that was included did not work (Acronis). I just might be a massive idiot, but I installed Acronis on 3 different computers and tried to copy files onto the SSD. Every time it failed. I was told I would have to restart my computer and let the program copy files over once the computer booted up, but every time I restarted I was just thrown into the log in screen. I ended up using a 3rd party program called AOMEI Backupper. I got my files copied over without an issue in about 1.5 hours. If you're having trouble with Acronis, just download AOMEI, it's free and it works.2. Some large programs still load slowly.I want to be very clear about this - 95% of the programs people use will load quickly. My windows starts up in under 15 seconds. I can load Photoshop and Lightroom in about 15 seconds each. And smaller programs like word editors open within 1 second. So for most of the work I do, this SSD speeds me along. However, the SSD is still slow for some larger games on my computer. Shogun 2 Total War loads in 1 minute and 5 seconds. On my HDD it took about 2 minutes to boot up the game, so it is much faster on an SSD. However, it's not 15 seconds fast like other large applications on your computer. There are a ton of games that I can boot up in under 15 seconds. I'm not picking Shogun 2 to say that the SSD is bad, I'm just using it as an example to indicate that not everything you throw onto this SSD is going to boot in the blink of an eye.3. Working with large files is easierI can now save (export/write to disk) photos from my photo editing programs much faster. The main issue with HDDs is that they are slow, so you can store tons of photos on them but exporting and importing them is painfully slow. With this SSD I can move through photos fairly quickly, which is also a very safe thing because the less time my photos spend exporting the less of a chance something will happen that will screw up the export.Overall, I'm really happy with the purchase. For $100.00 you can update any old laptop and give it new life. The external enclosure is also quite nice because I can now carry around my old 1TB HDD in the case to store stuff I don't access that much. I'm almost tempted to go out and get another hard drive to use as a backup just because I have the enclosure and now know how to copy my computer for backup."", 'Slightly mixed feelings...I bought the bundle kit because I was installing into a desktop pc, so I needed the SATA cable and the 3.5"" mounting bracket. I haven\'t had cause to use the USB caddy yet as I mounted the device straight into a spare internal bay before starting.The screw holes on the caddy all lined up properly.On the minus side, I was expecting the drive to have an aluminium skin, but it was silver coloured plastic with a rather cheap feel to it, which doesn\'t inspire confidence in the build quality. I suppose the plastic construction would be an advantage in a lightweight laptop.The bundled Acronis cloning software with the included license can only clone a whole disk, you cannot select partitions, which is no good when cloning your OS partition from a 1TB conventional spinning disk. I downloaded the free trial version of EaseUS backup, the newest version of which has an option to detect the operating partition AND the Windows 7/8/10 100MB hidden partition. This does the job nicely and there are plenty of instructional videos available online.On the plus side with the new drive installed my Acer M1930 Windows 10 PC now boots from cold to the login screen in 25 seconds which includes the 10 second pause while it asks if I need to edit BIOS options. The subsequent user login is virtually instantaneous. The whole process on the old disc was taking nearly 3 minutes. I then expanded the ""data"" partition on my 1TB drive to gain back an additional 240GB for document and media storage.(BTW, I checked online for firmware updates before cloning my OS, and the device was already using the latest version.)All in all, worthwhile, just a little disappointed with the plastic case and the free software. Otherwise, well worth doing.You might possibly save a few pence by buying the non-kit drive and the SATA cable and mounting bracket separately if you don\'t need the caddy. But it would be marginal.', ""pro's.....kit is great as it covers any install options you could think of......case for 2.5 drive is nice on laptop setups as you can keep your install partition of windows but delete the old OS space for storage on the drive removed from the laptop.....done right YOU end up with a ton of portable storage at no extra cost!!!....it includes cloning software to copy the OS drive you already have and coping the full 120gb takes about 45minutes ......well made metal case that feels 10 times more solid then the V300 plastic cases for the drive itselfcon's.....not as fast as the old V300 drives kingston has made for years.....i have a 120gb V300 and played with both of them on the same computer not running them as OS drives just for fun(i5 4690k, 16gb of memory x87 mother).....this drive is 50 to 100mb SLOWER then the older V300's depending on file size.....CLONING SOFTWARE.......on the older kits for the hyper X series and some of the other older series they have, they would give you a disc that booted a chopped version of linux to clone the drives.....you could use it a millions times over as long as you had the disc(i lost mine, one of the reasons i got this).......the new version included with this kit is locked down to a SINGLE motherboard like it was a copy of windows!!!! you also have to register with Acronis to download your copy and jump throw a bunch of hops as the included code is not a COA but a code to get emailed a COA......2.5 case is nice but its USB 2.0.....they could have given it USB 3.0 for 2 bucks more!!!finally thoughts.......its still a great kit and set up....no matter what jumping from a normal harddrive its worth it......if you already know what SSD drives should run on speed its not the drive for you.....its no samsung evo"", 'Ho sostituito un HDD 3,5\'\' da 7200rpm su un computer fisso con questo SSD, per farci girare sistema operativo e programmi.

Arrivano insieme al SSD:- un box USB 2.0 (occhio, 2.0 e non 3.0) per un disco da 2,5\'\'; nel mio caso lo utilizzerò quando sostituirò l\'HDD 5400rpm di un portatile, perché quello del fisso è da 3,5\'\';- un comodo ""cassetto"" (supporto metallico opportunamente forato) per il montaggio sul fisso in slot da 3,5\'\', con relative viti di fissaggio al SSD e al case del PC;- un cavo SATA rosso per i dati;- un cavo di alimentazione SATA collegabile ai classici MOLEX (+5V GND GND +12V) dei più vecchi alimentatori da PC (è assente il filo arancione dei +3,3V in quanto l\'SSD non ne ha bisogno);- un codice per attivare Acronis, software per copiare dati direttamente da un HDD al nuovo SSD (non l\'ho usato);- un supporto in ""gomma"" adesivo 7mm-->9,5mm per rendere il disco compatibile con slot da 9,5mm (non l\'ho usato).Appena montato, l\'SSD è stato subito riconosciuto dal BIOS. E\' stato sufficiente rivedere l\'ordine di avvio per poter usare anche il vecchio HDD come memoria dati. Suggerisco di abilitare la modalità AHCI del SATA prima di installare il SO, per migliorare le prestazioni e, una volta installato Windows, effettuare tutte le necessarie operazioni di ottimizzazione (disabilitare defrag, avvio rapido, indicizzazione, ecc...) indicate in vari siti web, al fine di aumentare la vita del SSD limitando le inutili operazioni di scrittura.Le prestazioni del computer sono migliorate notevolmente a fronte di una spesa non eccessiva.

You can stay with them for 10 years for most work. Still after 7 years, it is going strong. Only needed to make it as fast as my MacBook and Yoga NoteBook thet I bought recently. Ordered this (480G) with the extra SATA/USB cable/adapter. The shipment through USPS came late (got credit for one month of extra Prime for that). Connected it with USB cable it had to the machine and used EaseUS Todo (did not realize that I could get a free copy of Arconis TrueImage for cloning downloadable for free with the code inside the package) to clone my RAID disks on it. Took less than an hour for 400 Gig). After cloning was done, turned the machine off and used the SATA cable and adapter that came with the package to install it inside the machine in the 3.5 inch disk bays. Left the BIOS as RAID (no need to change to AHCI), added it as the first boot device, and volia everything was at least 10 times faster if not more. The machine now flies and no more the disk head seeking head noise from the old drive. The two RAID disks are just now the regular cloning back up and I will not need to have the RAID config set up for safety anymore.

This drive has a different logo but seems to be just as fast in day to day use. I got the upgrade bundle in 240gb size for my wife\'s Inspiron one. I find 256 or so to be the sweet spot for a us. I do nightly image based backups of all the machines to a server in my house so I am not afraid of a cheaper SSD, plus I have many terabytes of on location networked storage for our files and projects so a smaller drive isn\'t a problem. It is night and day faster than the WD blue drive the machine came with. SSD is the ""ram upgrade of the 90\'s"" as in it makes a very noticeable speed difference, and with the price of SSD\'s now, there is no reason to have a client machine without one. The acronis software that came with the bundle worked first time and was quick and easy. I have had issues with partitions missing on past tries with acronis so I wanted to use a newer version, hence the bundle.

As I mentioned before, I'm no computer boffin, but the cloning software that came with it was dead easy to use (I had to run the windows re-install on the old drive and then clone quickly before it crashed again), swoping out the hard drive took me 10 minutes after watching a quick youtube guide...and hey presto my laptop was working perfect again without any hassle.I don't use my laptop for anything hectic so the performance increase from a SSD is negligible to me, however I do note an improvement on opening and saving documents so clearly there is something.So, 5 stars for a easy, straightforward upgrade kit that I think most people can use and for a harddrive that works without hassle.""]"

Muy mal por parte de Kingston ya que te tienes que buscar la vida con otro software si deseas hacer una clonación de tu antiguo HHD.Hay que tener en cuenta el optimizar bien tu pc/portatil para que tu SSD rinda al máximo y desgaste lo mínimo, hay muchos tutos en Google al respecto.Kingston tiene una aplicación gratuita llamada Kingston SSD MAnager, en la cual puedes ver varios datos de tu nuevo disco, como por ejemplo la temperaturaa del disco, los fallos que tiene, los bloques libres, la vida útil que le queda, el firmware que tiene (éste es actualizable), las particiones si las tienes, el SMART, la seguridad, y otros eventos del disco.Según conversación telefónica con Kingston, previa a la compra, éste disco puede realizar 1600TB de escritura al dia, y tiene una vida útil antes de que puede empezar a fallar de 1.000.000 de horas (un millón de horas).Total, una compra fantástica.Lo recomendaria? SILo compraria de nuevo? SiVolveria a usar un HDD? Ni por asomo!!!Es caro? Un poquito, la verdad.Por cierto, en la foto no se aprecia, pero el cuerpo del SDD es metálico, no es de plástico como otros discos SSD de ésta marca u otra.Espero que os sirva mi opinión si quereis adquirir éste disco,En la web de Kingston hay una opción en la cual puedes ver si tu ordenador es compatible con éste disco, pero si no aparece ahi tu ordenador llma a Kingston y te lo miran ellos mismos.

I bought the Premium package that was offered by Canon which came with a 64Gb Sandisk CFast 2.0 card and backed that up with a Lexar 1066x 128Gb CF card, however in order to fully use the features of the new 1DX2 you need to use CFast 2.0 cards.On looking around both Amazon and the web in general you will see that CFast 2.0 cards aren't exactly cheap, especially for larger capacity cards which you will want especially if you are recording 4K video at the full 60fps (you get around 15 mins of video on the 64Gb Sandisk card).  An example is the Sandisk 128Gb Extreme Pro which comes in at a wallet breaking $400.So considering the price especially of the higher capacity cards, is this the bargain of the year?  256Gb CFast 2.0 card for under $200.  Double the capacity for half the price.  For the most part the answer is yes it is.After ordering this card I had a number of questions running around in my head regarding it as I'm sure you might. Now after having used it, I can answer those questions.  Many of which I'm sure will be the same questions you are asking.Is this truly a CFast 2.0 card and will it work with my Canon 1DX Mark 2?Yes to both.  The card comes unformatted.  Simply pop it into the camera, format it and you are good to go.  One thing to point out is that Transcend seems to put their labels on the opposite side than Sandisk does.  When you insert the card into the camera, with Sandisk you insert it with the label facing outward.  The Transcend however you put the label (the one stating that it is a 256Gb card) facing inward.Will the Sandisk CFast reader that also came with the Premium bundle read this card?Yes.  It is a CFast 2.0 card after all.Is this a brand new card or a used one?As far as I could tell this was a brand new card.  Although the seal on the Transcend box that it comes with wasn't completely affixed, it hadn't been broken and the card was unformatted when I inserted it into the camera (double checked with my computer), so yes it is a brand new unused card.Is this the best Transcend card on the market?This is actually a slightly older specced Transcend card.  The CFX600.  The latest card (that I can find) is the CFX650.  So no its not the best you can get.Is it as fast as the Sandisk card that came with the Premium bundle?Yes and No.  The Sandisk card has a read speed of 515Mb and a write speed of 240Mb.  As mentioned, this is an older specced Transcend card.  It also has a read speed of 515Mb the same as the Sandisk card however it only has a write speed of 160Mb.Will this record the full 4K video at 60fps?Yes it will.Will I still get 14fps/16fps (live view) from this card?Yes you will.  The Canon 1DX Mark 2 is specced to shoot 170 RAW images in a burst.  The difference between the two cards is that with the Sandisk you will actually far exceed the 170 RAW images before the camera starts slowing down as the camera is able to clear its buffer faster.  With the transcend you fairly much get only what the camera is specced for before it starts slowing down shooting.  I found that you actually get slightly more than specced (around 185) but this wasn't a scientific test and relied on my reflexes.  Still at 14fps, you are getting around 13 seconds worth of continuous shooting then you either wait around 2-3 seconds (it really is that short) for the buffer to write off to the card before shooting again or you can continue shooting at a reduced (roughly 6 fps) rate for around 6-8 seconds before the buffer has cleared enough to allow faster shooting again.So what are the downsides to this card?If you are recording both RAW + JPG (at the Large size) to the same card you will only get about 6-7 seconds worth of continuous shooting at the full 14 fps before the camera slows down to clear its buffer.  This is quite a bit lower than the Sandisk card.  Still you are getting around 90 continuous images at 14fps (roughly 180 images since you are recording the same image twice).If I only shoot JPG and not RAW, how many images will I get at the full 14fps?I honestly can't answer this one as I got bored holding down the shutter button.  The Canon specs say unlimited (well at least until the card fills up) and I totally believe that.  The camera did not slow down at all shooting just JPGs.Would you recommend this card?Given the price/performance of this card and the reliable, well padded shipping from Card Machine Outlet I would definitely say yes.  If you want the latest and fastest then this isn't the card for you.  If you are shooting 14fps for 25 seconds at a time then again this card isn't for you.  If however you want a card that meets the specs Canon laid down, can handle full 4K at 60fps and the advertised 170 RAWs in a burst then I don't think you'll find a better bargain than this."", 'fails a lotI lost a lot of material because the card just constantly crashes. (Using with Canon 1dX MK2, and Canon C200)', 'I also am in the situation of a recently purchased Canon 1Dx Mark II with no desire to spend $675 on a Lexar 256gb card.  So I bought one of these on the basis of the other reviews and comments saying that it worked and I can confirm, it works beautifully.  It actually has better performance on the blackmagic speed test than the supposedly top-of-the-line 64GB SanDisk card that came with the Premium Kit in the camera.  And while some debate the effectiveness of that piece of software, it definitely indicates to me that the CFX600 is plenty good.  See the attached screenshots for the speed test.  And don\'t believe the 400+ MB/s write speeds you see rated on some of the expensive Lexar and SanDisk cards, those are definitely worded as ""up to"" and I\'m personally doubtful you\'d see those as sustained write speeds in real life based on this test and others I\'ve done in the past with various types of solid state media.I also did 4k60 tests with it (my primary usage for this camera) and I\'m having no issues -- works great.  I only went up to 10 minutes because I didn\'t feel like sitting there for 30 but if it can handle 10 minutes then I\'m sure longer will be no problem.Highly recommended!', ""Well it works, the price seemed like it would come with some risk but I haven't had a problem with anything it handles the 4K 60 and 120fps perfectly, no corruption or any problems like that at all so far in the past few months so it's still going strong, the space is much better than I thought as well, the 4K 60 file size is HUGE but the 256GB handles it pretty well I haven't ran out of space in a project yet, I'm basing that on filming wedding videos so it seems like more than enough space unless you're planning on shooting a full 30 minute video on 4K 60, I reckon that would be hitting the red zone for storage space!"", 'Muy buen resultado con una Blackmagic Pocket 4 K.

I also own a Samsung T5 drive with 5 times as much space... but I haven't touched it ever since I got this cFast card.  Honestly I couldn't be happier."", 'Muchos de los que buscamos este tipo de tarjetas es porque nuestra querida 1D X Mark II crea un 4K tan potente que no cualquier CFast es válida. Levo unas semanas usándola en rodajes de alto nivel grabando 4K a 60fps y sin problema.Así que los que tengas dudas por si aguanta el codec de esta cámara, correcto.

Original-verpackt!In der 1Dx2 läuft sie super und die 64GB von Sandisk ist ein willkommenes Backup.Alleine wegen der Wartezeit beim Kopieren der Bilder rentiert sich der Umstieg auf CFast - ein Bruchteil gegenüber klassischer CF.Werde bei Gelegenheit noch Langzeit-Werte mit dazu schreiben; schaut aber wirklich solide aus.Also Leute nicht lange zögern, zuschlagen!', '１DXMⅡで使用していますが半年たち全く問題ありません。']"

The only valid complaint might be that the instruction booklet is a little hard to read without a magnifying glass, as it contains small type in a shaded font (black would have been better). However, anyone attempting to replace the hard drive in a Macbook Pro should download a free pdf user manual readily available online (search via google or duck duck, not Apple) and read the very simple instructions there. If you don't have a manual you should grab one anyway while they're still online. Otherwise the instructions from Transcend are outlined in simple steps that are easy to follow for anyone capable of basic tinkering.I'm a careful shopper and normally look for the best priced deal on the best hardware I can afford (which is usually modest and time tested, not the latest high end stuff) and although there are cheaper brand name drives out there I was tempted by the all-in-one package of a reliable MLC drive at a good price plus a reliable enclosure (I've had a few good drives ruined by cheap third party enclosures with poor electronic connectors).I was pleasantly surprised to find two really nice screwdrivers included in the package that are specific to Macbook Pros. Their magnetic heads helped not to lose the tiny 3mm screws and it was incredibly easy to open both the provided external enclosure and the Macbook. As per the recommendation in the booklet from Transcend, I first installed the new drive in the enclosure and used it as an external with the supplied cable to format it and copy my Macbook's drive data over. I then opened the enclosure and the Macbook and swapped drives and rebooted and my Macbook booted up many times faster with the new drive.As long as you handle everything carefully the entire process is a piece of cake. The trickiest part is not losing the tiny screws so work slowly over a good clean surface and also make a note of which way the small black plastic rail that holds the hard drive in the Macbook bay goes so you don't have to futz with it when putting it back in alongside the new drive.Since I back up my work on a thumb drive I installed the Macbook's old 500GB drive in the enclosure and stored it away as a backup in case the new drive someday fails."", 'Alles soweit prima. Das mitgelieferte Zubehör (FP Gehäuse und Werkzeug) ist wirklich ordentlich.Die Anleitung, wie schon hier geschrieben wurde, ist dürftig. Dazu kam, dass diese in meinem Fall nicht funktionierte, da meine Original Festplatte größer als die SSD ist. Enthalten waren zwar auf der HD nur ca. 180 GB, das Festplattendienstprogramm verweigert in diesem Fall allerdings das Kopieren. Ich habe dann Carbon Copy Cloner (Trial Version reicht) verwendet (darauf achten, dass die Recovery Partition mit erstellt wird!).Mein Ablauf war dann:- Neue SSD an den Gehäusecontroller anschließen und mit dem MBP formatieren (Geht dann auch ohne Booten in die Recoverypartitiion).- CCC installieren und die lokale HD samt Recoverypartition kopieren (ca. 2,5 h für ca. 180 GB)- HD ausbauen, SSD einbauen (siehe ifixit)- MBP starten und in Systemsteuerung die neue SSD als Startlaufwerk markieren, Neustart- Jet Drive Toolbox installieren und TRIM aktivieren, Neustart- In die Recoverypartion booten und mit dem Festplattendienstprogramm die Rechte reparieren, sofern notwendig.- Neustart und das System läuft nun sehr schön schnellAchtung: Beim ersten TM Backup nach dem Umbau wird der gesamte SSD Inhalt neu auf die Backup FP geschrieben und dauert entsprechend lang bzw. die Restspeicherkapazität beachten!Ein Stern Abzug für die Anleitung, ansonsten ist das Kit sehr empfehlenswert!', ""I had a standard 500 HD on my mid 2010 MacBook Pro. After I upgraded to Yosemite everything got really slow and I started getting system overload messages when running Logic X and MainStage 3 which was a huge problem for me since I use my Mac for live performances. I upgraded my memory to 16 GB thinking that was going to solve the issue but i didn't make a difference at all. I considered buying a new Mac but someone suggested me to upgrade to s SSD so ended up here buying this 240 SSD (didn't had the budget to match the original 500 GB). OMG!! What a difference!!! I can feel a 40% improvement in speed and I have no more stability issues. I feel like I have a brand new computer! OS loads fast, all programs load in 3 to 5 seconds, it's just fast!Installation was very easy, I did it my self following the instructions and the tools provided. Another cool thing is that I didn't really downgraded in memory space thanks to the USB 3.0 external enclosure they provided for my old HD. USB 3.0 is super fast! So now all my software is running on an internal SSD and my working files are stored on the external HD.If you don't have a SSD on you Mac right now and are having speed and stability issues I really recommend you to upgrade to this one. I'm so glad I did."", 'I installed this product in my Late 2008 Mac Book Pro.  I had two problems with the install.  I am writing this using the new drive, so everything worked out in the end.1) The instruction book was poor and incomplete, the online video might be a bit better.  Following these instructions would never result in success, unless you happen to be a mac technician who knows which boot disk to choose in the first place... who wrote these things?2) The old Mac drive does not fit in the external disk drive housing (even after unscrewing the 4 knobs sticking out of the drive).One minor thing was that I only needed to remove one screw to get the old drive out of the Mac (but did not figure that out until I  removed 10 wrong screws).  The screwdrivers that came with the kit were handy, and the case was needed for the transfer of data from the old disk to the new disk.I ended up using the carbon copy utility (CCC) to copy the old disk on to the new SSD, it took a couple of hours.  The instructions and disk utility were useless - throw away the instruction book it is incomplete (VERY FRUSTRATING PART OF THE PROCESS).  The carbon copy utility worked GREAT on the other hand.The amazon search did lead me to purchase the correct size disk for my system, and it is running faster and quieter.  The performance of the SSD (solid state drive) is a wonderful improvement.', ""The drive has sped up my wife's computer and it's now even faster than it was when we first bought her MacBook Pro 2011. It's truly a bargain, the set that it comes with is perfect for the installation and the shipping was fast. The only reason it did not get a full 5 star review is that since installing it, there is a very quiet but audible high pitched noise which I believe occurs as the fan is about to start up. It was definitely not there before the installation so that's why it takes a hit. The noise doesn't bother my wife at all so no harm done, but if it was me it would annoy me eventually. Otherwise an excellent purchase."", ""Super high quality materials, finish, tools, packaging and instructions; all for a great price. Excellent performance. Note: if this replaces a larger drive that has plenty available space, then can restore from time machine backup. I put the old drive into the enclosure (included) and use it for a backup disk.Followup: 3 months later the laptop stopped recognizing the hard drive. The geniuses at the apple store said it was the hard drive. Transcend quickly shipped me a replacement drive. As that didn't fix the problem, apple replaced the cable to the hard drive, which fixed the problem. I was told that apple typically replaces this cable whenever they replace a hard drive. Doesn't make sense, but the drive is great and the service is just as great. I should emphasize that most components have a 1y warrantee. This drive has a 5y warrantee."", ""Excellent product. No complaints now that it is up and running. The instructions for making it a bootable drive using Mac's Disk Utility did not work on my MacBook Pro. It was necessary to download and install Yosemite OS X separately on the JetDrive and then use the Mac's Migration Assistant to restore the files from the old hard drive. Easy enough, but I wasted a lot of time trying to do it according to the instructions that came with the product. On the plus side, with the JetDrive my MacBook Pro is now much faster in every respect. Also, the included case is housing the old drive which now serves as a bootable backup."", 'Je dispose d’un MacBook Pro mid-2009 avec 160 Go sur un HDD ""classique"".

The results were amazing in that the computer has become much much faster. Ive transferred all my music and pictures and documents to an external hard drive and so I'm able to use just 240 cb drive to replace the 500 data g b internal hard disc.A worlds of caution- don't attempt doing the change over yourself if you have a limited knowledge of computer hardware. The U tube video makes it seem very easy but it is not. Get a apple reseller to do the installation. They'll charge you around 1500/-"", 'SSD Aufrüstung macht Müde MacBooks Munter .
