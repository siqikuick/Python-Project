I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570.

La qualité de fabrication est très bonne et les matériaux de qualité. Je trouve la carte très belle, elle est très sobre (peut être trop à mon goût) avec juste le logo XFX en blanc. Je ne note pas de différence flagrante de qualité entre celle-ci et ma 7900XTX Asus Tuf. Une différence est que la XFX utilise une chambre à vapeur et la Asus non. La XFX est moins épaisse que la Asus mais presque aussi longue. La carte dispose en effet de dimensions généreuse (344mm de longueur), assurez vous que cela passe dans votre boitier avant de commander. Pour ma part sur cette config dans un Cooler Master  MB511 ça passe sans soucis la taille maximum pour un gpu étant de 410mm. Comme je l'ai dit elle est moins imposante que ma TUF 7900XTX (voir photo) mais ça reste une carte balèze. Les performance sont au rendez-vous, heureusement à cette gamme de prix et cette carte est clairement taillée pour pouvoir faire de la 4K et rempli à merveille son office sur mon second PC sur un téléviseur 4K. Mon 11700K sur cette machine bride peut-être un peu la carte en 4K même si sur le panel de jeux que j'ai testé ça tourne très bien. 60 fps de moyenne en Ultra sur Starfield, Cyberpunk hors RT tourne très bien et pareil 60fps sans soucis, Resident Evil 4 Remake la carte se balade et sur beaucoup d'autres jeux, comme sur Doom Eternal avec Ray Tracing, c'est la Vsync avec la TV qui limite le framerate, j'ai une télé 60Hz, la carte est clairement se balade. Niveau température, c'est du très bon. Maximum 68 degrés sur le GPU et 84 degrés sur le Hot Spot quand la carte est utilisée à 100% et ce après plusieurs heures de jeux. C'est vraiment très bien et tout ça en silence. Ces températures là sont obtenues en ayant overclocké la carte avec une fréquence pic de 3100mhz sur le GPU et 2650mhz sur la mémoire avec un undervolt à 1070mv et le power limit à + 15%. La carte consomme alors 400 watts donc les températures sont carrément OK. La carte deviendra bruyante si les températures montent énormément, ça arrive parfois sur Starfield où le HotSpot atteint les 90 degrés et alors la ventilation s'actionne à haut régime, mais je n'ai constaté ce phénomène que sur Starfield où l'optimisation n'est pas parfaite et il y a parfois des chutes de framerate aléatoires sur des zones précédemment visitées. Si votre boitier est correctement ventilé pas d'inquiétudes sur les températures surtout si vous ne faites pas d'overclock où elle consommera 350 watts à stock et donc chauffera moins. D'ailleurs j'ai vu pas mal de test sur le net indiquant qu'elle était bruyante en charge et comparé à ma Asus TUF 7900XTX c'est très proche et pourtant sur ces review la Asus ne souffre globalement pas de ce reproche. Le support Z-bar de XFX inclus est bien conçu, en métal, et inspire confiance plus que le support fourni par Asus par exemple. C'est la première carte XFX que j'achète et après 15 jours d'utilisation j'en suis très content. Ça tourne impeccable, en silence avec des températures maitrisées. Concernant le vendeur NRINFO, c'est du tout bon. Expédition rapide, service client très réactif et code Starfield Premium reçu le jour de la livraison de la carte. C'est top.En résumé une très bonne carte qui se rapproche de près d'une RTX4080 (hors Ray Tracing) une fois OC. À ce prix je ne vois rien en face. Il y a bien la 6950XT qui propose environ 15% de perfs en moins pour 220€ de moins (chez NRINFO d'ailleurs, les autres 6900XT étant plus chères) mais à partir d'une certaine somme je préfère partir sur la dernière génération. En résumé une belle carte, bien construite et parfaite pour de la 4k ou du 1440p à haut framerate. Un big up à NRINFO qui a été impeccable concernant ma commande."", 'My one year old Nvidia 3060 ti FE 8gb is a nice little video card ( from a legacy build) , but began to be challenged in DCS and MSFS running ultra/high settings on my new system build- i7-13700, 2 x Sam 980 pro, 64gb ram, Seasonic Plat 850watts, 3x Sam 870 EVO, 4x Arctic 120mm case fans, 2x Arctic 120 cpu fans on Thermalrite Assassin, Antec P101 case. No  real surprise since flight sims are notoriously challenging for frame rates,etc. DLSS helps some but native horsepower rendering really counts using TLAA, etc. The 40XX series is generationally  lackluster ( except 4090) , pricey, and stingy on VRAM.  Rumors are that Nvidia has drastically slowed 40XX production to support prices on existing cards for sale due to weaker demand.  AMD on the other hand are slashing prices the last few months on superbly built cards, equipped with more VRAM. AMD has also decided to reportedly focus on mid tier cards going forward and likely ceding the 4090 high ground to others. As competition heats up for gpu chips with AI exploding, prices and scarcity of consumer gpus may get problematic in 2024 and beyond. Cryto bad? Dont know. This new XFX 6950 XT is built like a tank and it is mucho grande. It dwarfs my 3060ti in the photo. All metal design, three fans, two 8 pin sockets, super reinforced IO shield to pcb support- little to no card “ sag”, unlike other giant AIB cards. It has three DP ports and one HDMI. With DP, it supports my 1440 165mhz Dell monitor. The 6950XT can go ballistic and compete at 4K if I decide to go to an LG OLED. Many users report using these for VR.  This card natively performs about 65-75% better than my 3060ti. It runs about 10C cooler, about 500-700 mhz faster, uses about 10% less vram and has DOUBLE the total vram. The only downside is its increased power consumption. At full tilt,  the 6950 XT consistently reports using  about 300 watts , and with my i7-13700 cpu  , the whole computer maxes out at 485 watts at the wall plug- measured by a Kill a Watt plug in meter. That gives my Seasonic 850watt power supply plenty of headroom. For comparison, my 3060 ti and i7-13700 measured about 350 watts at the wall during gaming ( about 39% less power). The 6950 XT shows about 20 watts power usage at idle. I have played with the fan curves a bit and the Adrenaline software used to load your AMD drivers is easy to use. I have only used the card a few days but I am IMPRESSED ! I feel great about the purchase due to its: relative price/ performance; superb build quality; beastly native performance; 16gb moving forward into an uncertain GPU environment between Nvidia, AMD and Intel. This card was nearly double the price about a year ago. I considered the 7900XT but a minimalist 16% performance increase did not justify  a 36% price increase. I did mildly consider the Asus 4070 but the $110 (16%)  price increase to get a triple fan Asus model with LESS performance - about 16% LESS in 1440 and 27% LESS in 4K with 4gb LESS vram. No thanks.BTW- AMD is releasing two new mid tier cards tomorrow at Gamescon and will be announcing the release of FSR 3, a competitor to Nvidias DLSS 3. Lately, I have seen more and more former Green team owners now buying Team Red video cards. Now I know why. The AMD 68xx and 69xx cards were great performers- now at greatly reduced  prices ( relatively speaking). Buy them before AMDs last gen super cards are no longer available. Like me, you will likely be impressed. Further, I used DDU Uninstall in Windows safe mode to uninstall the Nvidia drivers before I installed Adrenaline which contains the latest AMD drivers. Many YT vids on this simple and straightforward process.Registering your new video card at the XFX website reportedly extends your warranty to THREE  years and XFX video cards generally have strong customer reviews for build quality, long term longevity, etc.', ""This card is a monster performer! It's a large card at 344 mm, but much smaller than Nvidia's. And also isn't as wide as the competitor options. This will fit in most cases. The case shown is NZXT H7 Elite (max 400mm card length), and should fit in H5 (max 365mm card length) which would be tight.Not only does this card perform very well! You cannot beat the price for the performance and 24GB GDDR6 VRAM! Ample VRAM for the latest games to achieve the highest frame rates!Because this card is not as long as some of its competitor models, it doesn't have the sag, but to even reduce the minimal say it does have, the Z-Bar is a perfect solution to keep your video card stable and from moving around. The card in that picture is perfectly parallel to the system board. It screws to the end of the card with nice countersunk screws and supports the card with not only the two existing slots that the video card takes up, but the two slots below it just for mounting purposes.Regarding power connectors, this card has three standard 8-pin 12 volt connectors. No funky adapter cable or custom modular cable to PSU.This awesome video card has two video BIOS options with just a flick of the switch. When I first booted system, I kept it in normal clocking, once CPU and RAM were verified to be operating at max performance, then I flipped the switch to get extra FPS by slightly raising core clock and VRAM clock. With this card, switch position left towards the video ports is standard clocking, to the right towards the power connectors is the OC BIOS.The case has sufficient cooling and the video card never gets above 60c with the hardcore testing I had done before giving it to my daughter after she helped me build it.Be careful to pick the correct power supply! The CPU is AMD 7800X3D and they both require at least 850W quality PSU. The supply in this rig, not shown is an EVGA 1000 G5. My general rule of thumb which may conflict with others is that the power supply should be rated 20% more than the max peak load as to not tax the PSU at 100% load. Even though this is a large power supply in a small package, it is very efficient and only draws as much power that is required. Very little wasted energy and heat that I could determine just by putting my hand over the air vents while maxing out CPU and GPU.Having a UPS connected is a good idea to protect your expensive hardware, plus you get a readout of how many watts is being consumed from all devices plugged into it. It's not as accurate as using lab equipment for power supply consumption, but is good enough for getting a good idea how much your rig is consuming.Final thoughts, I would buy this card again! I bought this hardware for my daughter's computer and I am thinking about building a dark gray, all black inside, no RGB for myself with the same video card! Apparently Nvidia is having issues with their latest drivers, they seem to be going backwards while AMD is going forward. Wtf? Thank you AMD for your awesome hardware! Much better bang for the buck going all AMD versus Intel and/or Nvidia. The FPS proves that to no doubt that AMD is superior! My crappy 2017 Alienware 17 M4 portable desktop with lid (as they call laptop) has Intel and Nvidia and that thing overheats all the time. I've repasted that at least three times and is ready for the fourth time. Thank you thermal grizzly extreme!"", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0No voy a hablar mucho del desempeño de la tarjeta por 2 razones, la primera hay numerosos reviews de las 6800 XT para revisar eso, la segunda es que la verdad no tenia pensado comprar esta tarjeta sino la 6750 XT pero Amazon subió el precio tanto durante el prime day que me salia más barata esta, la razón es que tengo un core i5 11400, una fuente de 650W y un monitor 1080p, así que buscaba algo conforme a eso, la verdad es que esta tarjeta esta más enfocada a 1440p y 4K, por lo que mi hardware no la aprovecha del todo, pero bueno más que nada me voy a enfocar en algún otro punto que uno debiera tener en cuenta de este modelo en especifico, me encanta el diseño de esta merc, sus leds (que no son rgb) se ven de excelente calidad, los materiales igual, la tarjeta es enorme la verdad así que igual hay que considerar que se necesita un buen espacio para colocarla, en mi gabinete apenas cabe con un par de cm de sobra que se debe ver en las fotos, algo que me llamó la atención es que aunque mi gabinete tiene la tarjeta en vertical mientras la colocaba y acomodaba los cables noté que al ponerla de lado (de la forma que normalmente queda en una pc) no tenía la famosa caída que tienen la mayoría de tarjetas cuando son muy grandes y pesadas, creo que su estructura es muy rígida y evita eso, de temperaturas en lo personal no he tenido problemas, alcanza unos 70-73C en promedio y cuando está en idle unos 48-50C, eso si, siempre la uso con el aire acondicionado por lo que la temperatura ambiente debe ser de unos 24C, pero mi gabinete es de hecho bastante cerrado y casi completamente de cristal templado, las temperaturas de los demás componentes no sufrieron un aumento considerable tampoco, tal vez 1 o 2 grados, ahora, en muchos lados y en comentarios van a leer sobre el famoso coil whine, no se si todas vengan con ese problema pero al menos en mi caso si está presente, solo que en lo personal no me molesta, tal vez mi gabinete por ser bastante cerrado igual reduce bastante el ruido pero si entiendo que dependiendo del entorno y gabinete podría llegar a molestar a algunos, dejo unos videos donde se debe escuchar sin problema el sonido, uno con el gabinete destapado y otro con el gabinete cerrado y con algo de sonido del juego de fondo para que vean que al menos en mi caso si esta el sonido del juego sea con bocinas o mis audífonos puestos pues es imperceptible, el ruido no está fijo, depende del consumo cuando está con un consumo bajo el ruido desaparece, igual se puede escuchar en el video, cada vez que se deja de escuchar es porque pongo el juego en pausa y el consumo baja como a 50W, su consumo promedio suele marcarme unos 280-290W máximo pero ya depende del juego, creo que seria el único punto negativo de la tarjeta y como dije dependerá de cada persona si es un punto lo suficientemente malo como para pasar de esta tarjeta, pero por el precio, su calidad de construcción, diseño y desempeño creo que es una excelente opción, por cierto venia de una 6600 y no tuve que reinstalar drivers ni nada, y me la reconoció y funcionó a la primera sin problemas aunque terminé actualizando drivers de una vez porque no había visto que había una versión más reciente, lo poco que la he probado esta funcionando sin ningún problema.', ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0pour commencer cet avis, voici ma config :- Carte mère : MSI MAG B660 TomaHawk Wifi DDR4- Processeur : Intel Core i5 12600KF- RAM : Kingston Fury Beast 2x8Go (16Go) à 3200MHz (DDR4)- Refroidissement CPU : Cooler Master Hyper 212 RGB Black Edition- Carte graphique : AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX (XFX)- Alimentation : MSI MPG A1000G PCIE5 (1000W) - Modulaire- Boîtier : Phanteks Eclipse G360A (Blanc)commençons par le commencement : la livraison.j'ai pris la livraison à 9,99€, qui a été beaucoup plus rapide que prévu. le colis a été livré 3 jours après avoir passé commande, de ce côté là rien à dire. C'est DPD qui s'est chargé de la livraison et je n'ai jamais été déçu de leurs services.l'installation :l'installation s'est réalisée sans encombre dans mon boîtier, il faut en revanche prévoir un grand boitier pour y loger la carte car elle est vraiment mastoc ! dans le G360A ça n'a posé aucun souci.après 2-3 jours d'utilisation, j'ai quand même décidé d'installer le support métallique fourni, car la carte s'affaissait un peu. le support a réglé le souci, et s'installe relativement facilement ! faites simplement attention dans votre boîtier, le support peut ne pas rentrer car il rajoute quelques centimètres à la carte, qui est elle même déjà très longue. vous pouvoir sur les photos avec et sans le support !pour ce qui est de l'alimentation, il faut prévoir du 3x 8pins. Personnellement, j'ai opté pour une alimentation MSI de 1000W, et je n'ai aucun souci avec. Tout est correctement alimenté, pas de connecteur qui brûle (hum...), pas de black screen ou de BSOD... tout fonctionne nickel !performances :pour information, j'ai un setup avec 3 écrans 1080p + un volant de simulation, qui me permet de jouer sur 3 écrans à des jeux du style ETS2 ou BeamNG Drive en 5760x1080 (équivalent à de la 3k). J'ai mis en place AMD EyeFinity (équivalent du Surround chez Nvidia) pour simuler un seul écran 5760x1080, au lieu de 3 écrans 1080p, c'est ce qui me permet d'étendre les jeux sur 3 écrans. La carte graphique encaisse sans soucis ces jeux là en ultra à 75FPS (ils peuvent sans doute aller au delà, mais mes écrans sont en 75Hz, donc inutile pour moi d'aller au delà). Je ne suis franchement pas déçu des performances (et encore heureux à ce prix là...), comparé à mon ancienne CG c'est le jour et la nuit !températures et bench :de ce que j'ai vu, les températures sont maîtrisées. en lançant le jeu Tram Sim Munich, j'ai eu un peu peur quand la CG a commencé à souffler fort, mais en consultant les températures j'ai vu qu'elle ne montait pas au delà de 65°C. Le dit jeu n'est pas un jeu très optimisé comparé à par exemple ETS2, donc forcément ça tire plus sur la CG.j'ai lancé également un Time Spy sur 3D Mark (voir photo), j'ai obtenu 29 834 de score, ce qui est relativement dans la norme par rapport à d'autres personnes qui ont pu essayer cette carte. la carte est montée à 67°C au maximum lors du bench, ce qui est plus que convenable quand on regarde la puissance qu'elle délivre.niveau sonore :la carte au repos est relativement silencieuse, et pareil en jeu. lorsque je lance un jeu plus gourmand en ressources (ex. Tram Sim Munich), la carte fait plus de bruit par moment mais franchement c'est pas dérangeant, j'ai jamais mesuré plus de 45dB boîtier fermépour info, je n'ai pas testé les classiques du style Cyberpunk, CSGO, Apex... car je ne suis pas du tout friand dans ce style de jeux. je peux donner mon avis sur des jeux de simulation mais pas sur autre chose !en bref, pour jouer en 4k en ultra, c'est vraiment le top du top ! je trouve que c'est un bon compromis tarifaire par rapport à une RTX 4080, qui ne propose pas franchement plus de prestations. Certains jeux sont peut-être plus optimisés pour Nvidia (comme Cyberpunk), mais je ne suis pas sur que ça vaille le coup de débourser 300-400€ de plus dans une carte qui vous apportera un gain de 2FPS... après, c'est à vous de voir !Attention tout de même, vous ne pouvez pas comparer ce modèle avec une 4090, car cette carte est encore un cran au dessus par rapport à la 7900XTX.Je recommande évidemment l'achat de cette carte si vous souhaitez jouer en 4K ! Je suis ravi de mon achat, elle apporte des performances que je n'aurais jamais trouvé à ce prix là.En espérant que mon avis vous aura aidé à faire votre choix ;)"", 'This gpu is pretty much perfect. It\'s plenty powerful in games that I play, such as apex (1440p max 300fps). Maybe one downside is the huge powerdraw. It is not uncommon to see 400w+ powerdraw during games, but that\'s not that big of a deal for me. You could try to undervolt the card to maybe cut 100w off the power draw.This card from xfx has some downsides unfortunately. It has a very noticeable coil whine during games. Fortunately the coil whine is not very high pitched, but rather more of a buzzing sound. This is not nearly as annoying as the high pitch variant. It\'s pretty loud, but I can\'t hear it with headphones on. Other annoyance is the fan curve. Every time a new round of apex starts, the fans pick up and my pc sounds like a jet engine for a few seconds. I can\'t say if it will be louder in other games. This could also be resolved with just tweaking the fan curve but I haven\'t gotten around to that yet.Other than that the xfx speedster merc is a very well built card. It has almost no sag, even though it\'s massive. It also just looks so damn good. Very classy with some gamer-y elements. No rgb, but that\'s fine. It\'s also inaudible on desktop, because the fans turn off during not demanding loads.On the xfx website they advertise ""cast aluminum frame"", which is a lie; the frame is made out of plastic, with aluminum wrapped around it. Misleading marketing!Overall, for 650 euros this is a fantastic card. You even get starfield on top of it (you have to ask the seller NR INFO and they\'ll give you the code). The card got here nice and safely, since the seller used legit parcel companies like DPD and nordpost.']"

This was a noticable problem with my 2080 as well and this card is SILENT apart from the fans, which are also much quieter even under load.Asus's software is mostly garbage tier, but aura to change the lights to one color is fine and the rest of monitoring with afterburner since my GTX 460 still holds up. Other 3080Ti's have better clock speeds and beefier coolers and more lights and all that mess but this one runs REALLY well with the manufacturer not programming it to run SO strained, and has temp headroom for a bit of OCing later down the line.It's a long boy that's for sure. If it was 1cm longer it would NOT have fit (well not straight in at least) my Fractal Design Define R6, which is a pretty big case in a world of popular micro-towers. Measure twice and buy once!

Projekte in 2D, Rendern von verschiedenen komplexen 3D Körpern und ganzen 3D Gebäuden, Raytraycing von Treppengeländer mit Glas, alle 3D Fußbälle von AddiDas, Säulen, Kapitelle u.v.a. Interessante Objekte aus der klassischen griechischen, römischen oder zeitgenössischen Architektur. Ich kenne Autocad, seine Workstations mit teuren oder weniger teuren Graphikkarten genügend gut, um darüber ein Buch zu schreiben. Die „PNY Nvidia Quadro P400“ Graphikkarte ist ein Glücksfall für alle Architekten, die zuhause „Autocad 2023“ oder „Autocad 2024“ besitzen und in ihrer knappen Freizeit damit arbeiten, weil sie Autocad genau so lieben wie ich. Für die wichtigen 2D Projekte 1:50, 1:100 und 1:500 mit Grundrissen, Fassaden, Gebäudeschnitten, 2D Perspektiven, reichen schon preisgünstige Graphikkarten wie die „ASUS NVIDIA GeForce GT710-SL-2GD5-BRK“ vollkommen aus.  Will man aber 2D Fassaden farbig darstellen und farbgetreu auf Fotopapier im Format A3 oder A2 plotten, benötigt man unbedingt eine der von Autodesk zertifizierten Graphikkarten mit 2, 4, 8, 16 oder 32 GB Arbeitsspeicher, die entsprechend ihrer hohen Leistung im 2D- und 3D- Bereich leider sehr teuer sind. Die Autodesk Support Seite im Internet bietet eine lange Liste mit allen von Autodesk zertifizierten Graphikkarten für Workstations und Laptops von AMD und Nvidia. Die „PNY Nvidia Quadro P400 Graphikkarte“ ist von Autodesk als Graphikkarte für Workstations zertifiziert. Sie ist für die professionelle CAD- Arbeit mit Autocad 2024 und den anderen Autocad- Programmen gut geeignet. Es gibt viele zertifizierte Graphikkarten, die alle wesentlich leistungsfähiger sind als unsere kleine  „PNY Nvidia Quadro P400“ Graphikkarte. Diese sind aber auch wesentlich teurer und viel länger als die 15.0 cm unserer Graphikkarte. Für Multimedia- Programme wie Videoschnitt- , Videos anschauen,  Photobearbeitungs- oder Photodruck- Programme ist unsere kleine Graphikkarte auch gut geeignet.  Mit meiner alten „ASUS NVIDIA GeForce GT710-SL-2GD5-BRK“ Graphikkarte mit ihrem leisen, passiven Kühlkörper konnte ich die Farben der Fassaden nicht richtig  ausplotten, weil diese im Plot völlig verschieden von den Farben im Original zu sehen waren. Die weiße Farbe der Fensterflügel oder Türen wurden im Plot schwarz dargestellt. Die „PNY Nvidia Quadro P400 Graphikkarte“ verfügt über das gesamte Farbspektrum an Millionen von Farben, das Autocad 2024 anbietet, True Color und die Farbbücher. Sie stellt die Farben im fertigen Plot genauso dar, wie man sie in den Zeichnungsdateien am Computer in 2D oder 3D ausgearbeitet hat. Deshalb bin ich mit dieser Graphikkarte richtig glücklich und voll zufrieden. Sie kann alles, was ich von ihr verlange und was man auch bei anspruchsvollen Projekten dringend benötigt. Und sie ist nur 15.0 cm kurz, sie lässt sich deshalb in jeden Computer einbauen. Die „PNY Nvidia Quadro P400 Graphikkarte“ kostet nur 142,00 €, plus den Preis von zwei Monitorkabeln mit 2 m Länge, ungefähr noch zweimal 10,00 €.  Die drei kleinen mitgelieferten Adapter „Mini-DP auf DP“ benötige ich nicht. Die Nvidia Graphiktreiber von der mitgelieferten DVD benötige ich nicht. Das zusätzliche Slotblech und die drei kurzen DP- Adapter benötigt ich auch nicht. Der von mir installierte neueste Graphiktreiber von der Nvidia Internetseite heißt:  531.41-quadro-rtx-desktop-notebook-win10-win11-64bit-international-dch-whql_2.exeZuerst wird die alte Graphikkarte am Slotende entriegelt und herausgenommen. Dann wird die neue Graphikkarte sicher in den entriegelten Slot gesteckt und am Sloende wieder sicher verriegelt. Erst danach wird der neueste Graphiktreiber von Nvidia installiert. Zwei oder drei Bildschirme sind für ein professionelles CAD nicht nötig, ein Monitor genügt mir. Für professionelles CAD mit „Autocad 2024“ ist eine Auflösung von „1920x1080 Pixel 60 Hz“ mit der „PNY Nvidia Quadro P400 Graphikkarte“ völlig ausreichend. Mein CAD- Monitor ist ein 24 Zoll großer „EIZO EV2450“ mit einer Auflösung von1920x1080, 60 Hz (Full HD), mit Eingangsbuchsen für DISPLAY- PORT (DP), HDMI, DVI und D-SUB. Mit einem 2.0 m langen Monitorkabel „Mini- DP Stecker auf einen DVI- Stecker“ und einem 2.0 m langen Monitorkabel „Mini- DP Stecker auf einen HDMI- Stecker“ arbeite ich mit zwei Computern abwechselnd an meinem einzigen „Eizo- EV2450“ Monitor.  Möglich macht dies mein „UGREEN USB Switch 2PC USB 3.0 Switcher 2 In 4 Out USB KVM Switch mit 2 USB 3.0 A auf A Kabeln für Tastatur, Maus, Drucker, Scanner, USB Sticks“. Damit kann ich 2 Computer mit 4 USB- Geräten verbinden und alle gleichzeitig umschalten. Diese vier USB Geräte sind die Tastatur, die Maus, mein Canon Photodrucker und noch ein viertes USB Gerät wie z. B. mein Canon Scanner, dessen USB- Buchse aber bei meinem Switch unbelegt blieb, weil dieser Scanner an einen anderen Multimedia Computer angeschlossen ist. Um die zwei Computer jeweils mit Kabel-Maus und Kabel-Tastatur gleichzeitig an den Monitor umzuschalten, verwende ich den Monitor selbst. Das muss der Monitor können. Mein „Eizo- EV2450“ Monitor verfügt über einen Input Selector für DISPLAY-PORT, HDMI, DVI und D-SUB. Man kann mit der Graphikkarte „PNY Nvidia Quadro P400“ also mit 3 Computern abwechselnd an einem einzigen Monitor arbeiten, oder aber auch drei 4K Monitore gleichzeitig nebeneinander betreiben. Man muss nur die dafür passenden Monitorkabel dazukaufen.Ich sage Tschüss und viel Freude an der Arbeit mit dieser recht nützlichen Graphikkarte von Nvidia.Nachtrag: Um die vielen Farben meines Monitors „Eizo- EV2450“ richtig zum Strahlen zu bringen und um die Farbenpracht der Graphikkarte zu sehen, habe ich im Menü des Monitors die Sättigung der Farben auf +18 erhöht und die Farbtemperatur auf 9500 gesetzt, Helligkeit und Kontrast auf 90%. Mit dem Fraktal- Programm ""Density"" auf YouTube kann ich jetzt eine Farbenpracht und eine Farbenvielfalt an sanft abgestuften strahlenden Farben bewundern, wie ich sie bisher noch nie sah.', 'Por ser uma placa profissional, a Quadro dá imagem perfeita e calibrada para que a imagem no monitor seja exatamente o que o desemvolvedor criou.Ela tem 2GB de Vram e não é forte o suficiente para RV.Para ligar a placa ao monitor ou monitores são necessários adaptadores.A placa vem com 3 saidas mini-DP.

I am not a gamer. I originally had HDMI cords setup with the monitors and bough an HDMI adapter to connect it, so I didn't have to buy display port cables. I didn't think it would be a big deal since there were reviews that said it was ok. HMDI splitters were 4K as well. Easy installation and everything worked fine. However, when I opened my trading software the colors were bleached, faded, lines looked digital and showed multiple colors. After copious amounts of research, I noticed a lot of people complaining about the same issue. This was disappointing since this was the only thing I needed it for and of course it wasn't right. HDMI is more of a TV cable and won't register certain colors as fast. I disconnected all the wires, bought new display port cables, connected everything back and it worked. Colors and lines were clearer, and it made a big difference. Thankfully my monitor has HDMI and Display Port connections, otherwise I would have had to return the graphics card. Don't waste your time trying to fix it with Nvidia control panel; it won't work. Videos on YouTube were lagging as well with the HMDI cables, making it seem like my internet was slower. Everything is fixed and running fine now."", ""I bought this (VCQP400-PB) card to replace an  AMD V7900 that died.  I'm using it in Dell T5500 workstation with 3 monitors, two in landscape and one in portrait mode.  All three monitors are attached using DisplayPort cables.  The card is small, so I had to use the included taller bracket to install.  The card is short in length and in height.The card is low power and doesn't require the use of an extra 6/8 pin power cable.The card does support 3 monitors simultaneously.  Also, the card came with three miniDP to DP adapters, even though they're not shown in the V1 pictures.  As I write this only the pictures for the V2 version show the adapters.  I would preferred not to have to use adapters, but I would have to buy a much more expensive card to get standard DisplayPort connectors.  The mini connectors do lock into the back, so except for reliability problems associated with more connections, I expect these will work OK.The only problem I had with installation was getting the portrait monitor to work.  The Ubuntu display settings tool just wouldn't work with the portrait monitor.  It either turned the monitor off or left it in landscape mode.  I solved the problem by using the Nvidia X Server Settings tool.I'm not a gamer, so I can't speak to performance there, but playback in Kdenlive (a non-linear video editor) was smoother than with the AMD card.  HTML5 rendering in browsers also seems a bit faster.Amazon was the vendor.  No problems with the shipping or packaging."", 'Super easy to install. Works on small form factor machines.

A 4GB graphics card is likely the better option if you can find it, although this will play most video games that were made in 2017 or earlier.Keep in mind that Amazon does not have accurate information available about this card, at least not as I am writing this review.

Boy, I was shocked by its performance for the price. Definitely worth the buy.', ""Very competitively priced item. However the warranty information hasn't stated."", 'Understandably most customer reviews of this ASUS 1060 Dual OC and other graphics cards are written from the viewpoint of gamers and certainly contain a lot of useful benchmarking, as well as how they perform at 1080p resolution.  At the same time, periodically you come across an inquiry here and in forums about what is necessary for photo editing.  With all due respect, many of the answers are obviously from casual photographers having limited experience with what I would call “serious”, let alone professional, post-processing.  I am not a professional photographer, just a “serious” amateur, but while I don’t profess to have all the answers I thought it might be helpful for others out there if I share my own conclusions.First, some background.  I have four builds “under my belt”.  Yes, I know that doesn’t make me a tech expert either, but still reasonably knowledgeable.  For reference, current build is ASUS Z97-Pro ATX mobo, i7 4790K @ 4GHz, 32 GB GSkill F3-1866 RAM, Corsair RM 750 power, two SanDisk Extreme Pro SSD’s (one 480GB for Win 10x64 and executables, the other 240GB for primary photo storage), and a couple of WD Blue HD for other storage.  Current (new) graphics card is this ASUS 1060 6 GB OC, prior card was an EVGA 760 SC with 4GB vram (both purchased from Amazon).  Card is mounted in a PCIe 2.0 x 16 slot. A Display Port connection was used with both cards because of the potential for greater color depth compared to HDMI (for now that is limited by Windows and the nVidia driver) and the ability to daisy-chain monitors.  The monitor in both cases is an ASUS PA279Q ProArt (IPS, native res 1440p [2640x1440], 99% Adobe RGB, 10 bit color with 14 bit look-up table) calibrated with the Spyder Elite 4 Colorimeter.  Video driver is nVidia 372.70 running in 32 bit desktop color depth, 10 bpc output color depth, and full output dynamic range.  The only additional OC I have applied is the rather modest “Game” boost on ASUS Tweak II (because for my purposes I don’t need more, probably don’t even need this boost).  Overall not the absolute fastest system, but no slouch either.The photo editing software I use includes Adobe Lightroom CC, Adobe Photoshop CC, version 10.5.1 of On1 Photo 10, and some of the Topaz plug-ins.  For now, most of my post-processing editing begins in LR, with side trips to the others.  Note: Both the order of editing and experience with the above graphics cards may change once On1 release Photo Raw this fall.  Most of my photos are at moderately high res (24 MP), and I typically edit them in 16 bit.  Often I will spend one to several hours editing a single photo – with a number of layers and final size up around 40 or 50 MP.  (Don’t laugh:  Professionals sometimes spend several days.  How long do you gamers spend gaming?)  I have edited in both 1080p and 1440p, and prefer the latter for the better resolution (masking, sharpening) and greater screen real estate.  So what have I found?Lightroom CC:  The LR editing module, like Photoshop (below), is optimized to use a compatible GPU.  Open GL 3.3 or higher and 2 GB vram is suggested for high resolution photos [Note: Both of the cards being reviewed meet these requirements].  As long as you stay in LR you are performing non-destructive edits to your Raw file (assuming you started with Raw), and these edits are written to a catalog rather than incorporated into the original file.  Perhaps because of this, I have seen little difference in speed between the two GPU’s when editing with the sliders at either 1080p or 1440p.  I do notice some improvement in speed with the 1060 at 1440p (vs the 760) using the graduated and radial filters and the adjustment brush.  Thumbnails seem to load more quickly with the 1060 as well.Photoshop CC:  Not surprisingly, the PS GPU requirements are similar to LR. But unlike LR, which will automatically use a suitable GPU, in PS you must go to Edit>Preferences>Performance, turn on the “Use Graphics Processor” box, and then decide on the Advanced Settings (mine is set to Advanced Drawing with all options selected).  When using Adobe Camera Raw, the findings are much the same as with LR.  Once you take a Raw file into PS itself, though, you are rendering it into a PSD file – which can take longer to process than a Raw file.  When I do go to PS it is mostly to use things that are unavailable elsewhere – like adjustment layers, Content-Aware crop, the Blur Gallery, Gradient Fill, Smart Filters, text layers or Lumenzia (by Greg Benz).  According to Adobe, only certain functions are GPU accelerated (see Adobe Support).  Nevertheless, there seems to be a definite improvement in responsiveness with the 1060 (in either resolution) when using multiple layers and especially in “round trips” via a smart filter to both On1 Photo and Topaz plug-ins.  I used to avoid going back and forth from PS to these other programs because it was so sluggish.  Based on this, I suspect the GPU accelerated functions like Blur Gallery and Smart Sharpen will also speed up, though I haven’t tested them yet.On1 Photo 10.5.1:  Here there is the most marked difference between a GTX 760 and 1060, probably because this is one of the most graphics intensive photo editors.  The program is supposedly able to use “modern” GPU’s (Open GL 2.0 or better) with 256 MB vram and 4 GB system RAM specified (8 GB when used as a PS plug-in).  This spec alone makes me wonder if On1 Photo is relying more on the CPU.  In Preferences, I have the program set to use 75% of system RAM and 75% of vram, with a 5 GB cache.  As with PS, once you take a Raw file into On1 you will be rendering it as a PSD file.  On1 Photo is a program I want to love, but as with other reviewers I find there are still bugs in the interface and sluggishness in its performance.  In fact, using the GTX 760 at 1440p makes the program very slow indeed.  Layered effects (I mostly do not use presets) load slowly and it takes more time than it should to save your work – which you should do frequently because the program has a tendency to crash when you layer up too many effects without saving.  And forget using the masking bugs with the 760 at 1440p – they stutter and often freeze up. [These problems are somewhat less, except for the occasional crash, when using the 760 at 1080p.]  What about the GTX 1060?  Here everything changes!  Multiple effects load in the blink of an eye and the masking bugs work as they should, even at 1440p.  (I can’t comment on the program crashes as I haven’t used this 1060 for very long yet.)  All of a sudden it becomes a pleasure to use On1 Photo 10, and that’s good because this program offers some fantastic and easy to use editing tools for dynamic contrast, tone and color adjustments, stylizing and otherwise “finishing” your photo.Note: On1 Inc. will be releasing On1 Photo Raw later this fall.  It is a raw processor with no cataloging (vs LR), allowing non-destructive editing and use as a standalone, plug-in for LR and PS, or as a host app.  It will be “tuned for today’s graphics processors”, with a requirement for Open GL 3.3 with minimum 512 MB vram and 4 GB system RAM (8 GB when used with PS), and is being billed as “the world’s fastest . . . raw processor and photo editor available.”  I can’t wait to see how Photo Raw performs with the ASUS 1060 in 1440p resolution!Topaz plug-ins: Topaz Labs has a number of useful photo editing plug-ins for LR and PS, as well as several that do not require a host editor.  They recommend at least 4 GB of system RAM and 1 GB of vram (2 GB for optimal performance).  GPU requirements vary by product, from Open GL 2.1 to 3.3, and certain products will crash unless these specifications are met.  All of the Topaz products I tested ran acceptably with the GTX 760 in 1440p, although the more graphics-intense were a bit slow.  Running with the 1060 in 1440p they are noticeably faster and more pleasing to use.Summary:  While this is by no means an exhaustive comparison of the GTX 760 vs 1060 for photo editing, it is apparent that resolution is the key factor when it comes to determining your experience.  Many photographers and gamers are shifting to larger monitors and 1440p (or higher) resolution.  Once you try it (assuming adequate GPU support) you won’t want to go back.  The 760 and 1060 are several generations apart, and since I don’t purchase a new graphics card every few months I can’t be certain what is the minimal step up from the 760 for acceptable 1440p performance.  I can state with confidence that the ASUS GTX 1060 6 GB Dual OC will do the job.  Moreover, at the moment this card is at the “sweet spot” when it comes to performance vs price.  For benchmarking purposes running Heaven 4.0, my ASUS 1060 in Game Mode at 1440p runs at avg. 71.9 FPS (just saying: I know I’m not editing videos), with a GPU clock of 1886 and score 1811 at max. temp of 82C with auto fan in a well-ventilated ATX tower.  On FurMark 1.18, again in Game Mode, the score was 5280 at avg. 88 FPS and max. temp of 71C using the 1440 preset, 2560x1440 full-screen resolution.  The ASUS card seems stable in both tests.Bottom Line:  The GTX 1060, 70 and 80 line, with its Pascal architecture, is very attractive to gamers (and I hope I have shown it should be to serious photographers, as well).  Since you really don’t need the speed (or cost) of a 1070 or 1080 for photo editing, the 1060 would seem to be the perfect choice.  I have found ASUS products to be well-built and reliable – as noted, I also have an ASUS mobo and monitor.  The ASUS 1060 fits nicely in my ATX tower and doesn’t override two slots as is the case with some other cards.  Moreover, the dual fans are quiet and keep temps down.  I also appreciate the pair of HDMI and Display Port connectors.  The only caveat – Tweak II could use some tweaking.  You might prefer MSI Afterburner if you are going to do any serious oc.  My Conclusion:  Forget the forum advice about $80 graphics cards and so-so CPU’s for photo editing.  Pick up one of these ASUS GTX 1060 cards (preferably the 6 GB version) if you can and if your CPU won’t be a bottleneck.  You won’t go wrong!', 'installation simple, hormis l étape avec les vises.Les pilotes se sont installés tout seul j ai rien eu à faire, vu que j étais déjà chez NVIDIA. niveau bruit on entend rien du tout. côté jeux on voit une différence mais pour tester vraiment faudrait que j acheté un nouveau jeu comme elden ring', ""Why I bought this card: I needed a card to put in fairly budget rig I was building, and this was one of the cheaper cards available at the time.TL;DR : A very solid card, overclocks nicely, had no temp problems while gaming, fairly quiet. Definitely would recommend.Pros:-Good Cooler for the price-Plug and play, all you need are the Nvidia drivers and the card will work just fine.-GPU Tweak II is easy to use and gives full control over the performance of the card.-Overclock like beast, max OC was 2062 MHz, average OC was 2025 MHz.-2 HDMI ports, good not only for VR, but also for those who do not have any DP capable monitors.-No coil whineCons:-Shroud feels cheap-Fans on the louder side-The presets in the card management utility(GPU Tweak) are lackluster, make your own profiles for best performance.Other thoughts: For the 275$ I paid for this card at the time of purchase I expected some slightly better fans, though the current one get the job done fine.Full Review:Shipping and Packaging: Card shipped very fast, even though amazon predicted that it would take up to two weeks to ship, I got it in three days. The packaging was undamaged and very well done, with foam padding all around the card to prevent damage, though even the outer box in which the card was shipped was undamaged.First Impression:The card had an average weight at this length. The white plastic shroud felt on the cheaper side, though this is to be expected on a 1060 25$ above MSRP. The fans looked and felt like solid, medium quality fans. There is no back plate, but at this price that is the standard.Installation:Nothing out of the ordinary, card went into the pci-e slot with no issues and the 6 pin power connector had no problems going in either.General Use: The card performed very nicely after simply installing the latest drivers from Nvidia, so anyone looking for a plug and play card, you will find this card very satisfactory in that regard. The card will handle games at 1080p like the average GTX 1060, so I won't bother posting the benchmarks, because they are available from many different sources.Different Modes & Overclocking:Initially I was going dock this card a star for being nothing out of the ordinary in all of my tests, that is until I got to use GPU Tweak 2 to overclock the card and play around with the available presets. This card comes with three presets: Silent Mode, Gaming Mode and OC Mode, though you can add your own custom profile. Silent mode does its job well, it keeps the card as silent as possible, though this does prevent the card from getting its max performance to keep the card cooler. I used this for low intensity gaming and movie watching and it was silent throughout my experience. Gaming mode is nothing impressive; it will allow you to handle most modern games at 1080p without a hitch, but the fan profile on this is mediocre and the card will throttle after a few hours of intensive gaming. The OC mode is lackluster; yes it does boost the card to a higher frequency (1999 MHz) than gaming mode(1974 MHz) but it's not by much, and it barely touches the power limit, resulting in frequent stutters in my benchmarks. The fan curve on this is the worst of the three modes, and the card throttled down quite a bit after just 1.5 cycles of Unigine Heaven. Where this card truly excels is in the custom profiles category: I managed to dial in a 2062 MHz overclock on this card, which throttled down to 2025MHz due to the power limit, though 2025Mhz on a 1060 is still nothing to scoff at. Adjusting the fan curve, power limit and voltage was very easy, and to make things easier, the power limit and temp target are coupled, so raising the power limit will automatically raise the temp target for you ass well. though at high rpm, these fans are very noisy, but not the loudest ones I've heard on a graphics card before. On a final note for this section, even though it seems I'm ripping this card a new one, its more me complaining about he quality of presets for this card. The card is advertised with a Boost Clock of 1806 MHz, and the fact that this card has 150 MHz OC presets that are(mostly) stable is amazing on its own. Overall, a 200+ MHz final overclock over the advertised boost is awesome.Closing Thoughts:This card is very good for its price, so set your expectations accordingly. Since I only purchased one of this card, I do not know whether I just got very lucky to have a very high quality GPU in mine or whether the GPUs in these cards are consistently of a very high quality,so I cannot say whether it will perform like a premium card every time. Regardless, I would recommend installing GPU Tweak II alongside this card and using it to get the max performance out of this card every time."", 'Background: I am a CS student who was taking a neural networking/deep learning class. At the time, I had a GTX 465 with unlocked cores (effectively a 470 just without the name on the GPU). The code I was running was for a convolutional neural network training on an image dataset. Because of this, my computer couldn\'t handle it and I needed to utilize my GPU for calculations via Nvidia CUDA & TensorFlow. Unfortunately, my GTX 465 wasn\'t compatible enough (2.0 compatibility), so I had to upgrade. That\'s when I decided to go for the GTX 1060 because of its compatibility with CUDA (6.0) and its performance capabilities (1080p60 @ max or near max settings for vast majority of games) for such a relatively low cost for a GPU from the newest GeForce line. In other words, it seemed to be exactly what I needed for the class and for general use moving forward after the class.Needless to say, Nvidia has outdone itself with this new line of cards. This card far surpassed my expectations, and it\'s just higher-tier low-tier GPU of the line (""2nd worst"" after the 1050 Ti, not including its 3GB counterpart). Included with the card was a 1-year subscription to XGamecaster and ASUS\' own overclocking software.The CNN training on the Cifar-10 dataset ran 100k iterations with provided TensorFlow code in about an hour (bottlenecked by print statements every 10 iterations). Keep in mind, this card is meant for gaming and not AI-related use (that\'s for the $2000+ Tesla line), which is why I was pleasantly surprised at how fast its computations were.Now onto gaming performance. One thing to note: the overclocking software has three presets: silent mode, gaming mode, and OC mode. Each of these settings allow for the fan to be completely off or on an automatic setting. Its default is gaming. Additionally, you are able to create your own profile and adjust the clock boost, GPU voltage, fan speed, power target, VRAM speed, target temperature, and target FPS.On gaming mode, it was able to run GTA V at near-max settings @ 1080p60 without going over 60 C with the fan on. There was a bit of lag every now and then, which is fair. On OC mode, I am able to do the same thing but with no lag at all. On both settings, the framerate sometimes drops to ~55 and back up again in a split second. it\'s not noticeable to me on my 60hz monitor, but it may be to some.By messing with the settings, I was able to get the clock boost up to 2025 mhz before any real minor or major performance issues. To do this, I set the boost to +85 and the power target/target temperature to 100%/83 C. Then I set the fan speed to 55% and the target FPS to 60 FPS. The boost is able to go past +85 but keep in mind the boost is bottlenecked by how much power the GPU is given (I didn\'t want to mess with the GPU voltage for fear of messing something up).With these settings, I was able to record with Nvidia Shadowplay and maintain 1080p60 with no issues at all. GTA V runs extremely smoothly, maxing out at 63C when heavy rain occurs in the game. Otherwise, it rather ever gets to 55C. Keep in mind, however, that the GPU temp also largely depends on your computer\'s airflow/cooling set up. The fan isn\'t noticeable to me, and I never end up in a room that feels like Texas.The BEST part, however, is the fact that this card is SO efficient, I ended up using less power overall than with my GTX 465. With my GTX 465, I couldn\'t overclock my CPU past 4.2GHz due to power restrictions. With this GTX 1060 card, I was able to overclock the CPU to 4.5GHz. I can possibly overclock it even more, but I\'m fine at 4.5GHz.All in all, I am very satisfied with my purchase. For ~$250, I received a 1080p60-capable card that I can also use for deep learning (to an extent in practicality).For reference, here are my computer specs:i5-2500K @ 4.5GHZMSI P67A-G45 B3 Motherboard8GB RAM @ 1600mhzGTX 1060 6GB250GB Samsung 840 Evo SSD2 TB WD HDD', 'So I thought this during Covid when I built my first pc when things were crazy on sale and everyone was getting ride of inventory. A friend recommended this card to me when it had went on sale. Here it is 3 years later and it’s still running like a champ. If your gaming in 1080p. This is it , you can have the settings high get great fps. It has been a champion first graphics card. Running two monitors as well. I wouldn’t sleep on this if you’re just getting started and you catch it on a sale. Definitely a solid card. Only reason I’m considering upgrading now is because I bought a 1440p ultrawide monitor, so I figured I’d leave this long term review for anyone still considering if this card is still viable. It definitely is awesome first card', ""I waited a long time to post this review. I wanted to be sure that the performance was there, how the card handles in modern environments, etc.Let me say this card is beautiful. I got it for $271 before tax back in July of 2016. I believe it's closer to $300 now, and it's worth every penny, unless you have the funds to spend more and get a 1070 or 1080.This version of the GTX 1060 comes with 6gb of GDDR5 VRAM and a heavily boosted clock speed. Its only knock is the 192 bit bus instead of 256 bit, but the overall specs of this card more than make up for the bus architecture limitations.My card does rattle sometimes where the HDMI cables are connected, and I'm not sure if it's my particular card, or the card model, or what. I did a search for that problem, and didn't find anything other than complaints about coil whine, which my card does not have. Adjusting the HDMI cables fixes the high pitched rattle (it sounds like coil whine but it's not, sometimes it rattles when I move the case a certain way when cleaning my desk) so it's no big deal.With up to date drivers, I can max games like The Witcher 3 and Doom with this card and an AMD FX-8320 stock clocked. This game has no issues playing anything I throw at it, but games like Forza Horizon 3 I have not tried maxing, in particular Forza because it's a next gen game, and because I've read horror stories of how it performs when you try to set it too high. Saying that, Forza defaults to all near max settings, and looks absolutely stunning for me. Gears of War 4 looks beautiful. FarCry Primal can be played at near max settings.Unless you've got the money and the willpower to get a top of the line 1080, or a really really good 1070 on sale, the 1060 is so much bang for your buck, it's unreal. Keep in mind that the best performance gains you'll see will be on modern systems. If you're still using Windows 7 or 8/8.1, you won't see as much of a difference as you will on a Win 10 system, but you WILL still see a performance increase.Something to think about is that this card is more powerful than the R9 380 it replaced, and uses >maybe< half the power. I went from 2 6-pin connectors on the 380 to 1 6-pin on the 1060. Overall, my cpu runs cooler with the Nvidia 1060 as well, though I suspect that's because the PSU is less taxed (it's just a generic 600w) and not so much from any computations the GPU does.I hope this article helps. 4/5 stars because of the random whining the card makes, otherwise it's a BEAUTIFUL solid card. Before I forget, its max safe operating temp is 95 degrees Celsius. The highest I've ever seen it get is 81 and that was on Witcher 3 with hairworks enabled and everything maxed.Good luck and Have Fun!EDIT 5/14/17: After some more extended use of the card, many testings, a new power supply, etc, I have decided to bump this card up to 5 stars. The whining went away after I replaced one of the HDMI cables with a shorter one. Apparently the weight of the old hdmi cable was weighing on the card and making it uncomfortable... lol. Anyway, as of today, with a stock speed FX 8320, 16gb 1866 DDR3 RAM, and this card, Prey (2017) runs maxed for me at a smooth 60 fps. I know Prey isn't a top taxing game, but still, it is brand new, which shows this card is still very much relevant. Also, since upgrading to a new PSU (power supply) when playing The Witcher 3, the card now only goes up to around 75-76 degrees Celsius max where before it would go up to 78-81 degrees Celsius. Either way there's plenty of headroom as the max safe operating temp is 95 degrees Celsius, but still, I don't like my electronics roasting. If you're looking for a comparable AMD card, the closest offering they have would be the RX 480/580. Honestly, I would still use AMD, but I'm tired of them constantly recycling and rebranding tech. I'm hoping when I'm ready to upgrade this card in 3-5 years, AMD will have advanced to catch up with Nvidia. We'll see."", ""This graphics card is an excellent choice for 1080p gamers! It provides steady frame rates and I can play at ‘Ultra’ settings in all the titles I play. The GTX 1060 6GB still represents one of the best of the mid-range graphics cards available for the price, and if crypto mining did not inflate the price of the RX 580 GPU’s then maybe there would be more equal competition. That being said, my stream of thought was from a full month ago (Sept/2017), and at the time of purchase I paid $364.99 for this 1060 and I admittedly was looking at some RX 580 8GB cards. But they were all around $400-450. So, at the time it did not make sense, but since a month has passed on this purchase there has been some market changes again.While doing some research as I now write this review I am seeing more RX 580’s in the price range of $350-400, and admittedly I would recommend the RX 580 in most scenarios over the GTX 1060. Performance wise they are pretty much 100% equal at 1080p gaming, Nvidia cards pull ahead a bit in some titles, while AMD pulls ahead in others, but for the most part they provide identical performance. Software updates have helped the RX 580’s performance quite a bit since launch. If you are a new system builder and looking to buy a new monitor etc. the RX 580 is quite compelling, especially for a gaming dedicated build. Free-sync monitors are far cheaper than high refresh rate G-sync monitors, and whereas the RX 580 can be set up in Crossfire the GTX 1060 cannot do SLI.So, seeing my 5/5 star review and reading the last paragraph slamming into the GTX 1060 and praising the RX 580 you may question my 5 star rating. But I will explain why even today I still would have made the same choice I did 1 month ago.1- I already have several systems, all of which have high-end Nvidia graphics cards, but the purpose of this computer was to have a mid-range compact ITX gaming PC, I was not even considering a GTX 1070, 1080, or 1080 Ti. I just wanted steady 70FPS at 1080p ‘Ultra’ settings. At the time of purchase, this Asus GTX 1060 Dual OC Series 6GB was the best priced full-length graphics card that would fit in my case. The RX 580 I would have considered was at the time over $430, making the 1060 the better price to performance option.2- I already own a 144hz G-sync 1ms response time gaming monitor. So, therefore, ruling out a RX 580 that already cost more money than the 1060.3- And lastly as this system is based on an ITX motherboard, even if SLI was enabled on the GTX 1060 I could only ever put 1 GPU in my system anyways. So, a Crossfire setup had no bearing on my decision. GAMING: Frankly I am tired of reading on tech forums how people don’t recommend a GTX 1060 for 1080p gaming. And that to play at ‘Ultra’ settings you need at least a GTX 1070. That simply is not true. I have a system with a GTX 1080 yet I pretty much exclusively game on my system with a GTX 1060 6GB (paired with an i7-6700k and 16GB of RAM) and I play all my games at 1080p Ultra settings on a my 144hz G-sync monitor, and yet I almost never get lower than 70FPS. Granted some games like Witcher 3 will fall back with Anti-Aliasing at its highest settings but other than maybe dialing that back I know you can leave all other settings at 'Ultra'. I primarily play Battlefront, BF4, BF1, Shadow Of Mordor, GTA V, Watchdogs 2, and Assassins Creed (all of them), at 1080p Ultra settings with no issues what so ever.So, in conclusion, I stand beside my decision to buy this Asus GTX 1060 6GB. It give’s me the performance I was expecting out of it and I am very happy with this purchase. I have yet to try and overclock it, but I am interested to see if I can squeeze out some additional performance from this GPU, which is more of a budget GTX 1060.As I said with RX 580 8GB cards finally coming down in price I realize that many of you will be choosing it over a 1060, but if you ignore Crossfire and Free-sync monitors these cards will give you in-game performance so similar that you would never know them from one another. So, I stand by my choice and I encourage you all to choose which makes the most sense for you to buy. I am happy with my decision and although I did not choose this Dual Edition card for its color, it matches my white build perfectly, my decision was made on the price I bought it at. But to those of you considering this graphics card I can highly recommend it!""]"

Audio would play, but it's like the game completely stopped responding to anything without actually crashing. Due to a shipping error, I wound up getting two of these cards, and BOTH cards had the EXACT SAME issue. Tried every solution, from basic turn it off and on again to the idiotic run the storefront I have the game in as admin (this legitimately fixed this issue for some people on different cards) and everything in between, didn't fix it. ZOTAC Support couldn't help either, directly suggested I return the card for a refund after going through every troubleshooting step I had already tried with no new suggestions.YMMV, and it doesn't break like this on EVERY game (Sonic Frontiers ran fine with no issues for several hours), but as far as I can tell, this card does not work correctly with Hitman 3, which likely means it won't work correctly on some other games."", ""I upgraded to this from a 1660ti.

I love the card but thats my only complaint', 'tiene un desempeño regular si lo comparas con otras 3080, en cuanto a temperaturas se mantiene entre 65 y 75°c dependiendo del juego pero se me hace muy ruidosa cuando pasa los 70°c, casi no se aprecia si usas audifonos pero al no usarlos se nota el ruidero. tuve problemas de estabilidad (crasheos) pero en foros encontré una solucion que fue deshabilitar los perfiles XMP de overclock de la memoria ram y solo subir frecuencias y ajustar latencias manualmente. la tarjeta que me toco no puede hacer mas de +75 de coreclock porque crashea y tampoco se puede subvoltear como otras tarjetas porque pasa lo mismo. hasta ahora es estable ajustando la curva de voltaje a 1950mhz@975mv +105 power limit. mi mejor perfil de undervolt fue 1890mhz@925mv 100% power limit. estoy satisfecho con la compra porque la agarré de oferta', 'First and foremost, this graphics card is great. The only thing I have some issues with is VR but everything else runs butter smooth. My original card was a GTX 1660 ti and was a really good card for the price but I started running into issues of modern games not running so great and constantly lowering quality of certain games. VR of course was always playable but I could definitely see the downgrade of my previous card so it wasn\'t the card itself but was my hunger for better gaming. The card gets a 5 star from me, it does exactly what it\'s supposed to do. My only small complaint is that the fans can get a bit loud from time to time but that isn\'t a deal breaker for me.The only reason I\'m giving this 3 stars is having to deal with Amazon. My first hiccup was my original purchase was ""lost"" in the mail. I say ""lost"" because I don\'t believe my package ever was placed on a logistic vehicle and after about a week they finally decided to send a new unit. I did receive the replacement within one to two days so that wasn\'t a huge deal. I think me wanting the graphics card as soon as the site had said was what got me frustrated. When ordering the card there was a promotion for receiving three games after three business days of the card shipping and after the card is installed into your PC. I\'ve been in contact with several support agents and at this point I\'m just being ignored or passed along to another department. The promotion ended August 1st, I believe, but even before that the product page of the card I purchased stopped working completely so when I tried talking with a support agent they would have no way of looking it up. Luckily I screen grabbed the promotion listing with a bit of information linking the purchased card to the promotion but every time I mention this they tell me I\'ll get an email from a different department that ""specializes"" in the issue I\'m having. I wanted to make this review strictly about the graphics card but had no avenue to review the product and the company separately, at least not from my knowledge of searching. I even contacted both Nvidia and Zotac and both companies said around the same thing that Amazon is responsible for game codes. I contacted those two companies because Amazon told me one of them was responsible for game codes which I later learned was just a dance to get me to go away.So to summarize, I love the graphics card. Games look great, run extremely well and I\'m overall very happy with my purchase. Amazon hubris has finally reached a tipping point where service is declining and support has been outsourced to other countries while not giving them the resources necessary to actually help customers. I\'ve been an Amazon customer for over 15 years and have always been a cheerleader for the company but with all my shipping issues, customer support chats and calls the company is turning into just another faceless online store that cares very little about the people that got them where they are. I hope it gets better with the company because there was a time where Prime was an essential part of my life but am now questioning if it\'s worth it now. So Zotac RTX 3080 good, Amazon bad.', 'It is a good GPU, but the cooling system is very loud.I built a silent PC and got that GPU, since it was the only one I could get at the time. But in my case, this was a mistake, as soon as I start a game the computer pass from fully silent to jet-engine noise... Not what I wanted.But otherwise the GPU works as expected.', ""This is such a great upgrade from the 980gtx ti the performance is great. I was a bit skeptical about this company at first and wasn't sure if I should spend the extra money on Nvidia but I'm really happy with this purchase works exactly like it's supposed to. Did great on benchmarks and the noise level is very low compared to most cards of this caliber on the market. It is a big card as are most 3000 series and 4000 series so just make sure it will fit in your case. I got lucky and was able to snake it into place."", ""Its a value 3080, it's loud as hell but i wear headphones and my mic is noise canceling. Also my pc sits on the table next to my monitors so if it were under the desk I probably wouldn't hear it as much. Overclocking in minimal on the card as the power delivery system is basic. Other than that I get an average of 90 fps on Forza Horizon 5 at max quality, 1440p. Cod I get 190 fps at competitive quality settings at 1440p, I play DayZ aswell and I get 300 fps at competitive settings."", 'Awesome got this thing for a deal and it didn’t disappoint', ""Okay... so it's a 3080. It runs like a 3080. It's good. Paired with a Ryzen 9 it's able to handle even unoptimized games like Star Citizen well. So far, I like the performance. The downside? The cooling is atrocious. The fans are hard coded to not kick in at all (as in THEY ARE OFF) until the heat gets to a certain level. Then they'll kick in with a fury until it thinks 1) I should idle again, or 2) MAXIMUM POWER ENGAGED (and they ramp up even more). So because of this, it's putting unlimited levels of heat into my case and the noise on the fans is terrible.Get it? It's in the lower end of the price range for any 10GB 3080. So... YES! Probably going to have to water cool it. There are no AIO for this, as it's not quite a reference card. You have to get a waterblock and create a cooling loop. Some people hack the fans and put Noctua fans on. Some say it works. Heck the Ryzen runs hot too and this in a close case is causing it to boil. I'm just going to water cool the GPU and CPU in one go and be done with it. Until then I have an oscillating fan facing into the side of my open case and I'm still a little worried about heat. However, the performance is all there. It's great for gaming.Just beware the cooling. Great if you plan to watercool already."", 'The PC was unable to communicate with the graphics card as there was a software update while my part was already on route to me. I was unable to get a display on my screen when I was first booting up my computerThankfully I can also get display through my my other chip (not display port only HDMI) so that I could complete the required software update']"

Pude haberme comprado una RX 560 de 4GB, pero quise algo un poco más potente en ese rango de precio, así que miré a la competencia para ver alternativas.Personalmente, de una GTX 1050 a una RX 560, preferiría la RX 560, pero miré a su hermano mayor, la 1050 Ti, en especial la variante OC de Zotac, porque tiene un disipador que abarca al GPU entero, asegurando que se mantenga súper fría, incluso con OC extra de fábrica. Así que decidí vender mi R7 360 (me serviste muy bien) a un muy buen amigo mío y completé lo que me faltaba para comprar la GTX 1050 Ti.Como primeras impresiones, no usa un conector PCI-E, lo que significa que sólo tienes con conectarla a la tarjeta madre, además jala muy poca energía, jala 75W, lo que significa que incluso una fuente de poder mediocre de 300W es suficiente para este GPU, personalmente uso una fuente Cooler Master de 475W que compré hace 8 años y hasta ahora no me he visto en la necesidad de cambiarla.También estoy extremadamente sorprendido con las temperaturas de este GPU, estaba acostumbrado a ver la R7 360 fluctuar entre 35 °C en IDLE y a 40 °C viendo Netflix o YouTube (usando el disipador Artic Cooling S3), pues ahora resulta que la GTX 1050 Ti se mantiene a 28 °C en IDLE y apenas llega a los 30 °C viendo YouTube o Netflix, definitivamente un cambio muy grato, en especial considerando que usa el disipador de fábrica.Y hablando del disipador, a pesar de usar 2 ventiladores pequeños (no estoy seguro de su tamaño, pero son más pequeños que uno de 80 mm, probablemente de 40 mm cada uno), no es nada ruidoso, incluso bajo mucha carga. No quise perder tiempo, así que probé DOOM en Vulkan a 1080p en calidad Alta y texturas en Ultra, se mantenía a 60 fps la mayor parte del tiempo, sospecho que mi CPU ahora es el cuello de botella. DOOM es muy exigente, así que le hechaba ojo a las temperaturas y se mantuvo a 52 °C como máximo; nada mal.Decidí hacer OC extra (¿porqué no?) y definitivamente logré mantener los 60 fps estables en DOOM y la temperatura no cambió mucho, subió uno o dos grados a lo mucho, sigue siendo MUY aceptable para mí.En conslusión, estoy MUY satisfecho con esta tarjetita, muy fría, bastante silenciosa, no jala tanta energía (incluso con OC extra) y tiene excelente rendimiento en los juegos AAA en 1080p (con algo de moderación u OC).Nvidia no me hizo extrañar a AMD y eso es muy bueno. ALTAMENTE RECOMENDABLE.', 'More than 15k hours of use in gaming and I can still play modern games, you can play 1080p at 40-50fps smoothly with very low power consumption.']"

I noted that the control of the character seem much smoother and I really liked the feel of  not having to sometimes ""wait"" for the action to ""catch up"". I then tried Remember Me and boy what a difference! Even with the Unreal engine\'s known pauses at times, the difference in performance was very, very pronounced. With my old set up, one would have to wait in certain areas for the scenes to load, With the new card and system, I found myself not even realizing I\'d just passed thru some of those areas anymore. Most all the action was smooth and on the places where the worst slow downs were, you could hardly notice them now. I also noted the QTE events were easier to manage too. I decided to see how big a heat hit and PS hit I was getting. I did meet the requirements for the PS, but that isn\'t always all there is to it. Well, I ran up Speecy to see what it showed and to my surprise the HDs were running warmer than the card was! Also I noted no problems with the PS dealing with the card. (This card draws its power from the MB and has no extra lead to the PS.) The system was very stable and it handled everything I could throw at it including a few old Dos games running under DosBox. At this time, the system is running solid and I\'ve seen no problems running anything I\'ve started that would run on Win 8.1. This card is a good buy for those looking for a good solid card that won\'t break the bank but delivers good performance. Good buy!', 'good', 'Card went right in after changing to provided blade and video looks great!', ""I got it to use in an older system that I got for cheap to use for camera system. Drivers where old enough that GeForce experience didn't know them but I downloaded them manually from GeForce website."", ""This is probably the highest level of graphics card you can go - in a small form factor PC.I bought this card after a bunch of research, on the power consumption, which left me with a shock: a 235W power supply can totally support this card. Although the 64 bit does leave this card a bit on the behind side, however the 2GB DDR5 memory is no joke. With this card paired with my i5-650, I can play GTA 5 at Medium to High settings with 8x MSAA at 30 FPS at 720P (my monitor is a 720P monitor). Couple other games I tested were Blade and Soul (Level 3, 30 FPS); Counter Strike: Global Offensive (Highest, 54 - 63 FPS) and League of Legends (Medium to High, I did not change the settings, and I was getting over 140 FPS).I would recommend this product if you meet the following:1. Will to do some research.2. Will to make some compromises.3. A bit of modding can be done to the PC.Here I will explain why those are listed.For the first one, the power supply manufactures made the power supply so that people can have some spare power to upgrade their PC. For my PC, my PC used to have an ATI Radeon 3450 256MB graphics card, which requires 23.1W at full load. This card requires 25W at full load, the difference is only 1.9W. After doing a bit of power calculations, my power consumption without the graphics card is at 173W, my power supply is 235W, so there are about 62W of spare power left in the power supply. Of course you don't want to use all of these power at once because you have to leave some space out before the power supply explode. After the calculation, my power consumption is sitting at around 200W, At this point, the power supply is really at its maximum, you really don't want to make any other upgrades.Second, since we are talking about maxing out the power supply using the graphics card, USB ports should be used at a limit, a typical USB 2.0 port is using 3 W of power, a typical PC motherboard has at least 6 USB 2.0 ports at the back, so that is going to be 18W in total, which will make the power supply running at the maximum effort. You do not want that to happen, so buying a USB hub with an external power supply would help, therefore the USB devices are powered directly from the transformer instead of the PC power supply. Therefore the power supply is not in maximum effort state.Also, since this graphics card is a bit taller than the Radeon 3450, the original hard drive case in the Optiplex 980 SFF cannot be placed in normally, since I am using an SSD instead of the 3.5 inch hard drive, I am able to stick the SSD under the optical drive and call that a day. If you are using a standard 3.5 inch hard drive, you may need to place it somewhere outside of the case, and man that was noisy.I am overall very satisfied with this card, I would definitely recommend this product to people who can actually do some research an being able to make some compromise if necessary.Update: Realize this people! This version of GT 730 was released on June 18th, 2014, and the newer GT 1030 was released on May 17th, 2017! There's a good 3 years of difference! Stop thumbing down the product just because GT 1030 is better! By the way, it's not as good as you thought it would be, for one reason only: power consumption. This version of GT 730 only consumes 25W of power, while the GT 1030 consumes 35W! In an extreme condition that 10W of power counts. Besides that, the 730 is actually capable of 1080P gaming, just don't expect quality graphical conditions, same story applies the 1030, but 1030 can handle textures slightly better than 730. Neither of these cards were meant for gaming at all. However, the 1030s are in fact cheaper than 730, so for the price/performance ratio you should go for the 1030, if condition allows of course.""]"

Unlike some other customer's experiences, mine was clearly brand new (sealed box, plastic film on all the components, no screw marks on the radiator, etc).The reason why I'm giving this 4 stars is that it seems like MSI and Amazon will both give you the roundabout when it comes to warranty service. Although everything registered correctly with my serial # on the MSI webpage, instead of giving you a 'months of warranty left' page like every other manufacturer, MSI just tells you to contact the retailer (Amazon). Although Amazon does not directly dispute this, if you click on the link on Amazon it tells you to first go through the manufacturer website, and only contact them as a third option.Both Amazon and MSI seem like they are trying to pass the buck here - I'm not sure why it's so hard to just give a date: warranty expires on - xyz.

It seems to be something else.  Can’t say if it’s the water pump for sure. I just know it is triggered by intense graphics rendering. I was able to trigger it on/off while playing diablo 4. When I pull up the map, no sound, hide the map (high detail 3d rendering) then you hear the noise.  I don’t notice when I play with sound (even low volume) but with no sound, it’s noticeable.

The image quality was tremendously better, but the onboard graphics processor was limited to HD resolution.  I\'ll need to replace my PC in the next two years to accommodate Windows 11 (or 12), so I was limited to finding an ""older technology"" graphics card built for a PCIe 3.0 interface which happened to be available on my PC\'s motherboard.  My research led me to this card which I purchased two months ago, and I finally took the plunge to open up my trusty (and dusty!) old computer to install it.  The installation was easier than I\'d ever imagined, and after I powered up the PC again (and it struggled through multiple Windows 10 and other assorted application updates since it had been powered down for a week), the computer discovered the new graphics card, and then the graphics card identified the monitor and configured its output for full 4K resolution.  I was literally awestruck at how finely detailed the monitor\'s display is now!  I of course don\'t use this ""vintage"" 3rd gen i5-based PC for gaming, but the increase in image quality and fine-grained detail literally changes the experience interacting with Windows, viewing images and data on web sites, and working with documents and spreadsheets.

And even a 4K HTPC would require a higher-end card.But for 1080P HTPC, this is an outstanding fit, and does just what is needed."", ""It was time to upgrade my 11 year old Intel Core 2 Duo based PC recently and so I had done all the usual things someone who is able to build their own machine does, namely I selected my CPU, motherboard, RAM and SSD. Now, I must stress that my needs are very modest. I do not play any kind of games nor do I run any content creation software. In essence, my PC is a fancy office PC.All that was left was to choose a new graphics card. I could retain my ancient Nvidia GeForece 9600GT, but that card required additional power via the appropriate cable from the power supply and I wanted something much more energy efficient, quiet and modern. The choices given my use case were fairly obvious. I could go for an AMD RX550 or the Nvidia GT1030. Both cards traded blows in various performance charts, but what tipped the balance for me was the fact that the Nvidia offering did not require additional power, drawing a paltry 30 Watts maximum from the PCI-E slot. Using less energy usually also translates to a cooler running card and so the GT1030 was the clear choice for me. In addition, the 1030 was actually cheaper!Next decision was, which one?Perhaps ironically, I wanted a card that had a fan and thus was actively cooled. Despite the card running fairly cool anyway, I still wanted an actively pooled one rather  than various passively cooled cards on offer. Sure, those cards may be better suited for use in a home theatrew PC based in your living room, but I still find the fan to be so quiet,it really isn't an issue. Most cards offered a pair of video ports, usually an HDMI and a DVI port. That suited me, although MSI did offer one with a Display port in place of the DVI port which was no good to me although may be a consideration to others who require or prefer connecting their monitor via a display port connection.So, of the actively cooled GT1030's available, which one to pick?There are some models that come pre overclocked from the factory, offering around 50MHz higher boost clock speeds, but this is a tiny performance bump in the scheme of things and I suspect is more a marketing ploy to part you with more money. besides, if you know your stuff, you can likely add the 50MHz to the boost clock if you're so inclined using the required software tools. Nope, no need for a tiny boost like that, so why did I finally settle on the Zotac model? Well, as cooling was my consideration for selection, I literally weighed up the list of cards which saw the Zotac model come in at some 318G, the heaviest model I was able to find. Added weight usually is as a result of more metal, more cooling area in other words. On a card so small, I cannot think of much else to account for the difference between some of the models. In addition, to anyone considering this model for their HTPC build, it does come with the half height bracket so many have lamented were missing from their choice of cards. Further, the Zotac card was one of the cheapest available at the time I purchased, so a great deal since I got a fan and a bracket for that price!In operation the card runs cool and quiet. However, to be fair, I am not stressing it at all as it essentially just runs my Windows 10 desktop and video playback via YouTube and the like. Still, inside my tower case the fan via the software utility, Hardware Info, reported an idle temp in the mid 30's - around 35C I believe. Fan noise was not even noticeable. I could hear my case exhaust fan and CPU cooler fan over the video card. Of course, quiet is subjective, so anyone wanting a truly silent card for their HTPC setup may want to consider a passively cooled model, but I don't think the fan on this would be an annoyance even in a small HTPC case, - not unless, of course, you're sat with your head close to the case and then you might hear the low whir of it.A note to the less informed, do not select a card that advertises it uses DDR4 memory rather than the much faster GDDR5. Some vendors did release cards, Palette was one I believe, that used this inferior form of memory for the card's video RAM.There have been some critical reviews of the GT1030 that focus on its relatively poor gaming performance. This card was not designed for gaming, so the critical nature of some reviews is unfair. Yes, you can run some lightweight games on this card,but do not purchase this card if you believe it's going to offer a  highly playable frame rates on Pub G at high settings.For those who simply want a cool, quiet and efficient video card for everyday PC use with the ability to playback 1080p and 4K video content, this is all you need if your choice of CPU does not come with an integrated GPU as most Intel CPU's have done for the last several generations. For average desktop use and video playback, even that will work fine for you. If, like me, you've opted for an AMD CPU that doesn't come with an integrated GPU, then this card is a good choice."", 'Happy', 'ottimo', 'Installation and driver update of the card in Dell 960SFF was no brainer. However, concern is the tight fit of the card where the heat sink pushes the HDD cover. Hope the heat sink does no damage. Otherwise, this is good and serves as expected.', ""I just built a new workhorse PC. It needed discrete graphics and I wanted to keep the power footprint of the GPU as low as possible.

After an extensive amount of research this was the best option for me on both performance and financial levels. Moving on.I was extremely excited to receive this package. It\'s a big size compared to the standard GPU\'s that\'s installed in mii PC. But, upon unboxing it did not come with any documentation as a few others complained about. And as a newbie to the technology field there was no installation manual. I feel there should be an install manual regardless of one\'s level of expertise. I ended up taking my PC to the local tech shop to help install the new GPU. When I pick it up tomorrow and play with it for the next couple of weeks I\'ll update this review for everyone regarding its overall performance.UPDATE: 12/15/20 - *This is mii review as a film maker/video editor, not a gamer.Pro\'s:So, after a LOT of troubleshooting with how to better utilize this card so it can deliver on its hype regarding all specs, I have to say I\'m pretty pleased with the outcome. I\'m not that tech savvy so apologies for not being able to provide you all with actual numbers. But, I use this card for editing in mii Davinci Resolve software and the performance is more fluid than what I was experiencing before. Mii work flow consists of the normal steps for editing a feature film: color, sound, trimming, etc. Additionally, it handles well with creating 2d models in Fusion and rendering them out. I was able to create some portal effects for mii current project and it ran fairly smoothly. Rendering out mii projects has been a cinch! I think that\'s what I\'m most pleased with out of everything. The clips that I\'m currently rendering out finish (depending on length) anywhere between 0:30 secs - 3:35. It really does help when you know the program you\'re working with and how to set everything so it works in unison with your GPU before beginning a project. Teamwork makes the dream work with these babies :)Con\'s:I have to say that while I am enjoying the work flow more now, I did have to divide mii film into 8 separate sections in order to work fluidly. It was still giving me issues with lag and freezing and I presumed that was because of the amount of work (data) I had in mii film. Especially, the SPFX with the portals I was creating. Working in smaller sections helped immensely, but it can\'t deliver when it comes to editing a film with ""fair"" amount of SPFX. To give you an idea, I\'m not doing anything ""ILM"" type. I\'m merely creating some basic particles that swirl around and have that nice glow to it, then adding that as a layer to mii footage. That\'s it. Next, I did ""some"" digging and found that the RTX 4k can\'t be joined with a similar GPU to increase performance. This is what I\'m currently searching for so that I can get more for less since the higher end GPU\'s are just too expensive for me. I\'m not sure if this is true or not, but if you\'re more of an expert at this than I am I\'m sure you\'ll figure it out. Mii last bit is regarding the price and where to purchase. Mii next go-around will be with Newegg, B&H, etc. Amazon definitely upscales their prices on these cards and it\'s not right. I found this card via a compatibility search for mii motherboard, on Newegg for HALF the price I paid on here! Yea, that pissed me off! But you live and learn and newbies like miiself will simply have to do more research when it comes to products they don\'t fully understand.  Regardless, I won\'t be purchasing any sort of electronics (in this capacity) from Amazon ever again as I found they upscale ALL of their cards. Right now I\'m saving for the GeForce RTX 3090 to get back in stock and Newegg had it marked at $1,800, while Amazon has it currently at $2,600.I hope this helps some of you. Stay safe out there and happy editing/gaming holidays to you all :)', 'I now own both the Quadro P4000 and Quadro RTX 4000 – so, I’ll try to help with your Professional decision making. Gamers should refer to Geforce RTX & GTX reviews:From research and what I have experienced personally – Quadro leans heavily towards OpenGL stability and accuracy – especially, when matched with ECC memory and multi-core CPUs (greater than 4 cores IMO). The exception is single-core performance when modeling (CPU architecture – which I favor Intel in this category).The RTX 4000 is unique – because it unlocks FP16 performance normally reserved for Gaming cards (hmmm..). And, every program I have based on Direct 3D performance is on steroids now.**UPDATE: My favorite programs (SolidWorks 2019, **Solid Edge 2020, Adobe Premiere/Photoshop,** Keyshot 9, Blender) – all love this new RTX 4000 card (in one form or another):>SolidWorks 2019 (heavy on OpenGL and some D3D) – the performance increase is ridiculous (thank you Dassault) – especially viewport performance, animation, and rendering. Go bigger than the 4000 – if you need scientific data / accuracy. Dassault is paying attention (IMO)>** Solid Edge 2020 (OpenGL with acceptance to D3D) – is stable and functional – WELL DONE SIEMENS - the newest version is a treasure (Simulation & Generative design are incredible). RTX 4000 and P4000 are both good choices>** Keyshot 9 Render (Holy God!!!) – I have to change this review - because the new Keyshot 9 is amazing with GPU / CPU rendering that will blow your socks off. The RTX 4000 is a beast at GPU rendering (Thank You Keyshot Team)>Blender (Direct 3D heavy) – models are much more fluent, viewports load and manipulate better, Mesh conversions and animations are incredible (thanks to FP16 performance gains). A lot easier to work between Parametric (files with high triangles) and Polygonal (files with low triangles) with the RTX>**Adobe (Everything You Got) – A lot more support for RTX since my last review. Adobe will not be silenced in this revolution. The RTX 4000 is a strong performer with Adobe products.OpenGL (professionals): is used extensively in the fields of computer-aided design (CAD), virtual reality, scientific visualization, information visualization, flight simulation, and video games. [Wikipedia]Direct3D (gamers & professionals now): is a graphics application programming interface (API) for Microsoft Windows. Part of DirectX, Direct3D is used to render three-dimensional graphics in applications where performance is important, such as games. [Wikipedia]Please do your research – and, I hope this helps the newbies looking for the Quadro experience', ""****UPDATE NOV 4TH 2021****All was well for a few months at least. As of the past week I have been experiencing intermittent blackout of a single screen with multi monitor setup and flickering in and out running a solo monitor. It has performed adequately to this point, now I question just how much longer it will last....********************************* Purchased this card for a system build at my workplace.I'm the CAD Designer here in our shop, and being ultimately intimate with computers they offered for me to build the workstation I desired if I could beat a prebuilt suppliers pricing (very easy to do with supplier markups these days).This card fit the build and the budget perfectly.I am primarily running Solidworks for 3D Design, and then Draftsight (AutoCAD Clone) for 2D.I have not run into any snags so far even with very large assemblies.The card is more than powerful enough for my application and comes in a small form factor. You could fit this in almost any case. The downside to this is the card does run on the hot side, so make sure you have adequate airflow for proper cooling. Hopefully the components are properly designed/selected for the temps and longevity is not affected. Only time will tell, and a protection plan just in case (this is the most expensive item I had to purchase)!Only Con is that Workstation graphics are expensive in general, this is definitely on the lower end of the spectrum. If you are doing heavily intensive rendering you'll likely want to step up to a higher end card. Just my 2 cents."", 'Both my daughters got married this year and I made them very nice video\'s of their 800+ largeformat professional photos that my old computer couldn\'t do with Proshow 9 Producer. The old computer was pretty strong in video creation until I tried to do this huge job. This card wasn\'t blazing fast but it smoothly handled the task without giving any errors like ""ran out of memory"" which I got with my old computer that I built myself specifically geared towards video creation. I finally got 2 beautiful keepsake videos of each wedding and hopefully these will be passed down through the future generations. I\'m not a gamer but tried Crysis on it and it worked well. I also use Vegas Pro and that works well so I\'m happy with it.', 'And when I called the vendor\'s ""tech support"", I was told to go to the Nvidia web site and that\'s all.  ""If for any reason you are not satisfied, please contact us immediately at xxx-xxx-xxx. We can make it right. We sincerely value the feedback of our customers"".  Not.UPDATE:  After I wrote this initial review, the vendor\'s tech support called back and offered to help with the installation. I appreciated the call, the vendor did respond to my unhappiness receiving a non-retail product without documentation and product registration. By that time I\'d downloaded drivers from nVidia, and was ready to go. I am happy to report that the installation went completely smoothly. Everything works well. It is the best video card I\'ve ever had, although my main use of it is computational rather than gaming etc.I did try to register the purchase at the PNY web site. Their product registration web page drop-down list does not even include this product. I ignored the list and registered by serial number but at this point I\'m hoping to never have a warranty issue.  Anyway, bottom line, the vendor did rethink their reaction to my initial dissatisfaction and the product seems to be excellent. You just have to think about whether you\'d prefer to buy the full retail package product.', 'I am not a gamer... Now that that is out of the way. I use this card with Blender, Maya, Unity, and Adobe Dimension, as well as various other multimedia software for video/audio like Adobe Illustrator, Davinci Resolve, and Steinberg Cubase. Overall, I am very pleased with the no-hassle performance of this card, along with the very fast real-time render performance I get in Blender and Unity. It carries a load well, and the drivers are rock solid, which was important for me. I had several driver issues with my previous Radeon RX 5700 XT with Win 10 Pro. For reference, my CPU is an Intel i9-10990k and my MB is an Asus ROG Strix z490-e.', 'Vas très bien, elle est performante pour tout même pour jouer à élite dangerours.Le seul problème, c’est que la carte est très mal refroidie, donc on ne peux jouer plus de 30-45 min max.

The original install included a black screen for quite a while, then several reboots from an unfinished boot and finally after a long time it finished the install and has worked well since quickly booting up.  It took so much time the first time to boot I almost returned it.', 'Probably could have gotten a whole new computer for what this cost', 'I used my computer mostly for Photography, and have appreciated the reliability of the Quadro series. My older Quadro P2000 was more than satisfactory for running Photoshop and Lightroom, however a program called Topaz Sharpen AI taxed its speed. I purchased the newer RTX 4000, and speed went up by 3X. A ""stabilize"" sharpening of a 24MP photo used to take about 3 minutes, but now takes just under a minute. The RTX 4000 still a one-slot card which I appreciate, although it does take an external power connector, unlike the slower P2000. I\'m pleased with the purchase and the large speed improvement in Topaz Sharpen AI.']"

DX10 and DX11 games like GTA V and barotrauma run okay with occasional stutters but it's not often or bad enough to ruin the experience unlike with DX9 titles. Other than that, the GPU is a solid performer and I'm happy with it. You won't find another GPU that comes close to performance for what I paid for this one.

I paired the arc a750 with a 13th gen core i7 k series which has a igpu. And the a750 combined with the igpu uhd 770 gives me exactly what I needed and more. They work in hybrid mode giving me even more performance than using it with out the igpu. The arc controller even has a virtual cam setup, so now I don't have to renew my xslpit subscription and it can broadcast directly to twitch, but I'm not a gamer and hope they add YouTube. I know when they first came out last year, they were really bad, but have made great improvements in their updates and hopefully they get even better. I heard if you play old games the quality isn't very good, that's because the arc upscale directx 11 to direct 12, so I wouldn't recommend it for older games. I would have had to spend at least double to get the same performance. I definitely recommended this prodect if you're a creator."", 'I bought this card to replace my RTX 3060.

I was really considering paying the extra $200 for the 770 16gb but when I saw benchmark videos comparing the two it was barely better than this one. It seems to use blender and unreal engine 5.3 for 3d modeling just fine as well', 'This thing works great, after spending two days trying to install it. My Windows, like most, was running on legacy bios which is incompatible with “resizable BAR”, which is necessary for the gpu to work properly. I had to completely reinstall Windows and had to buy a new power supply because this gpu has an 8 pin and a 6 pin plug. Now that it’s finally installed and working properly, it’s fantastic. I’m running Ark and God of War on max settings, it’s smooth as butter and looks amazing. I definitely recommend this gpu if you’re either very tech savvy or not afraid to research and figure out how to make it work. Expect to be updating bios and reinstalling Windows at the very least.']"

I installed it into my first computer build I have ever done. I have not come across a game it can't handle. If anyone knows the game star citizen, it handles this game very well which is impressive seeing as it is one of the most detailed games in the world. Not to mention you can run vr with this GPU which is another bonus. Great graphic card."", 'I have used it for more than a year. No issues, excellent temperature and performance. Easy overclock on MSI Afterburner. I recommend it 100%.', ""Fantastic card for the money.If you're looking for the ultimate 1080p graphics card this is your card! Now that's not to say that other AIB (add in board partner or third party, non-reference designs) cards are bad, not at all, just that based on my experince with this card, I can safely say it is a great choice. On a side note, if you're not into Asus's offerings, a good friend has highly recommended the EVGA Superclocked 1060 3GB as a potential alternative.Now let's talk performance. Based on my testing and running a few in game benchmarks this card can easily destroy any game at 1080p with ultra or high settings, and maintain 60+ frames a second with minimal dips. A few examples: I was able to run Metro Last Light with all settings cranked to max at a smooth 60fps. I'm also able to run Rome 2 Total War with ultra presets at an average frame rate of 83fps. While I know these are not the newest games on the market, they are very demanding and I think represent the capabilities of this card well.I'm aware that there is some concern about the 3GB of VRAM not being enough. Well at 1080p for %99 of titles this is not something you need to worry about. Newer titles are being designed to be able to take advantage of more VRAM, but I honestly don't think this is something moste people need to worry about. If you're the type of person who wants to be on the bleeding edge of graphics performance then yes a 3GB card is probably not for you (not to mention why are you even looking at a 1060, go buy a 1080Ti). BUT if you're like me and you have a large back catalog of games you regularly play, while also wanting to check out newer titles, then this is a very good card at a very good price.If you are really worried about the VRAM then just buy the 6GB 1060. I don't think its the best deal for the money, at least not at the time of writing this review, but if you're concerned buy the 6GB card.As a side note during my testing the card topped out at 1700MB of VRAM used.So will this card last you 4-5 years of ultra settings and high frame rate gaming in all the newest titles? No probably not, at some point in the next 2-3 years in the newest titles you will probably have to start adjusting settings lower than ultra-high. If this bothers you buy a 1070 or 1080, you'll get more performance out of them for a longer period of time. But again if you are like me and don't necessarily play only the newest titles this is an amazing card. I plan on keeping mine for at least 3-4 years. My previous card, the EVGA 670, lasted about 2-3 years before its performance started to lag behind new titles. But as far as my back catalog, the 670 can and will still play about %80 of my games at ultra-high settings in 1080p at 60fps. So why did I replace it? Honestly it was time for an upgrade and I'm looking to be able to play some new and many older games with good performance. The 1060 is about %57 more powerful than my old 670. That is a huge bump in performance! Mind you 4 years ago the 670 cost me $400. Take that into consideration when looking at the 1060.Ok so how does it overclock and does it run hot? To be blunt, amazingly, and not at all. Without even messing with the settings I set the card to OC mode and it automatically oc'd to 1800Mhz and in a 4 hour gaming session its temperature peaked at 40c, using the default fan settings. NOW, I have some very solid passive cooling installed in my case, assuming you only had 2 case fans you will not be able to hit these temps at load. Good cooling can make or break performance. 2 case fans is a minimum, I recommend 4 or more. So are the cards fans loud? At full speed yes, I tested them, but during my normal game play sessions the fans never rapped up more than %37 and at that level they are not loud or noticeable.Can it do 4K and 1440p? Yes it totaly can, but in order to get decent frame rates you will have to adjust the settings. I don't recommend trying to use this card for anything more than 1440p gaming and 4K video playback. But can it do 1080p at 144Hrz? No, not at ultra settings in the newest titles. It can probably hit around 100Hrz in some first person games. If you want 1080p ultra settings at a solid 144Hrz or higher in all the newest titles, you need a 1080. Sounds ridicules? I know I thought so too before doing the research, but that's the reality.In my opinion the 1060 and Asus's version in particular, is the best bang for your $ currently available.And if I'm wrong in any way, I'll come back and amend this review, that's how confident I am in this product.And can I just say, wow does it look cool? I know looks don't matter for some people, but man it's a nice looking card. Even comes in a really nice looking box if you care about that.That's everything I have to say, go buy one."", ""I bought this Graphics Card during the Fall sale, and I couldn't be happier. Try and wait until this card goes on sale (under $200) before you buy it. I can play most if not all games on max settings with little to no stuttering/lag. The card is not that big, but just make sure that your case has enough space before you buy it.Overall, this is a great High-Quality budget Graphics card that won't hurt your wallet."", 'Excelente para hace streaming en facebook y YouTube', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Muy buen producto con buena calidad, por el precio por lo que la consegui fue por $5,600 aprox $284.15 dolares. para jugar una gran variedad de juegos sin problemas. no he echo OC pero por lo que he visto en test no cambia mucho el rendimiento... para primera grafica es una belleza si es que quieres conocer la tacnologias de NVIDIA, la verdad el ray tracing a mi opinion no vale la pena a menos que solo juegues triple A , ya que es algo que despues de tiempo la verdad uno se olvida si se quiere jugar a juegos competitivos o multijugador recomiendo una grafica de AMD AUN QUE pueden tener problemas de drivers, el ray tracing de esta grafica es un quita sed ya que no lo vas a poder jugar en buenos FPS en algunos casos, yo la verdad la escogí por el precio y por la tecnologias que tiene NVIDIA, pero si requieres fuerza bruta AMD puede ser tu opción', ""ASUS makes some quality products, if you buy 1 of their mobo's or vid cards you won't be disappointed"", ""So I always like to deeply research my products i buy before I like to purchase them. I purchased the 1060 the other the other night at 10 pm and received it the very next day at about 3 pm. i was so surprised at how fast it got here. but anyways, installing was a bit tricky for me since i have never installed anything before, but the manual is very straight forward and there are plenty of videos on YouTube to figure it out. the hardest part about my installation was installing the 500w power supply i had also bought for my PC. I installed both of these upgrades into my Acer Aspire ATC-780A-UR12. i bought this PC a little over a year ago for just $500 and have used it to stream my gaming addictions and do school work on. I would also recommend this product. Before installed the new graphics card i would only get about 30 fps on games including Overwatch, CSGO, Apex Legends, Fortnite, etc (ON LOW SETTINGS) and everything turned OFF. After installing the graphics card, i hopped on Overwatch and noticed an immediate change, it changed my settings automatically and i was playing on ultra settings at almost 120 FPS. I then tested CSGO, and was playing at 220-260 FPS! This was absolutely mind blowing to me that this graphics card helped my PC this much. Honestly i think my PC is quieter now and usually when i check my CPU in task manager it is almost maxed out at all times, but it was running at 10-20% after the GTX 1060 was put in. I am so happy i purchased this item and cannot even recommend this product more for anybody who doesn't want to spend more than $300 on a card. This card does more than enough in my opinion, but i guess anything better than 30 fps would have made me happy. i have a total of $750 in my current gaming PC and couldn't be happier!Oh i did run into one issue after booting up my PC. i tried to download the software off of the NVIDIA website and was having issues with my download, it would say that i couldn't download due to my task scheduler not running - this is an easy fix, just watch a YouTube video on it if it happens to you. (this was just an issue with my PC i believe)other than that this is a great product and especially for the price! 5 stars from me (;Update: Still using this on my PC and literally no complaints"", ""I have heard a lot about this generation of cards over the years and have thought about upgrading to it, but never really cared to. Until recently. I don't do a lot of hard core gaming nor do I play some of the more high end newer games that have come out on the market recently, but for what I do, this card works great.My video card started to act up recently, an older NVIDIA 470, so I started looking for newer card that was good enough to play so games but not break the bank. I searched around and settled for the RTX 2060 OC version.Installation went pretty well, no issues there. It is currently supporting my three monitors with no problems, even while playing a game. Frame rate is decent while play COD:  Black OP 3. In the 70s with everything set to high. There is some fan noise, but not a lot more that usual than when my rig is running.What I really do is model computer networks and needed a card that would support multiple monitors at once with high resolution. Along with detailed documents. This one does it very well.Its been running without a hitch so far about a month with no issues. I like it."", 'Saw this card for $180 (after tax) and bought it right away.3060 costs twice, and maybe the 4060 is the same MSRP, not worth it for performance.TBH I didn\'t get this for gaming.I got this as a discreet card for my ""work"" ITX PC, GEEEK A70 case & 4650G CPU. That I built during the ATH of Crypto.Now I have Nvidia Broadcast (I use the camera follow feature), CUDA for Adobe products, and other hardware acceleration for screen sharing/streaming and video calls.

Es como la salida de la gama X en Xbox, cuando anuncian HDR + 4K + 60 FPS cuando todo el mundo estaba adaptando el jugar a 1080p con 60 FPS.Por primera vez en muchas generación de gráficas para sobremesa, AMD se siente como un contendiente real, y sólido para la gama alta de NVIDIA, teniendo compatibilidad en conectividad lista para monitores que aún no llegan al mercado, ofreciendo codificación en vídeo que ni si quiera plataformas líderes en la industria como Netflix han terminado de adaptar (AV1), y sobre todo, con una potencia gráfica a la altura.La versión XT es en promedio, un 12-18% más lenta que la XTX, haciéndola la gráfica ""menos atractiva"" de la gama actual. Dado que yo tengo el punto fijo en 1440p con HDR y una buena frecuencia de actualización de cuadros, la diferencia en rendimiento no me es relevante, ya que este monstruo mueve cosas a una velocidad poco creíble. Battlefield 2042 al máximo, incluyendo Raytracing, el framerate no baja de 120+, quedándose constantemente en 170 que es el tope de refresco de mi monitor competitivo. La versión Next Gen de The Witcher por arriba de 100 fps con todo maximizado (excepto Raytracing que está buggeado y es injugable). Otro a informar aquí es CoD que en su último juego y en el Battleroyale está por arriba de la 4090 de Nvidia.Voy a darle 5 estrellas, porque el modelo de referencia de AMD cumple con creces con lo que ellos mencionan;1.- Mi gabinete ITX el RVZ02 de Silverstone, no es un impedimento para encajar está gráfica de nueva generación en mi computadora. Entra perfectamente y a pesar de su increíble peso, no mueve el balance de mi gabinete y este se puede mantener de pie a la izquierda de mi monitor sin problemas.2.- Aún que ellos anuncian como fuente mínima una de 700 watts, mi mini fuente de poder de 600 con certificación platino de Corsair ha sido más que suficiente. La gráfica consume un promedio de 360 watts bajo carga muy estresante (utilice test sintéticos para ello). Así que si, en AMD han cumplido con solo sustituir y conectar, ya que el PC a lo sumo, consume 450 watts totales.No todo es color de rosa, vamos con lo negativo;1.- La paquetería de Amazon nunca, en serio, nunca me había quedado tan mal en la historia, y ya tengo años de comprar aquí con esta cuenta. No solo no empaquetaron el producto, por lo que se veía perfectamente que se estaba enviado, sino, que además, la caja me llegó especialmente golpeada (agrego fotos). Afortunadamente el empaquetado de PowerColor ha evitado una trajedia, pero el envío dejo mucho que desear aún que llegara un par de días antes de lo previsto. Es mil veces preferible que llegue tarde, pero en buen estado, que esto.2.- A pesar de su ridícula potencia por watt, se nota que los Drivers aún no están del todo a la altura y aquí NVIDIA le pone un repaso histórico a AMD del como se deben hacer las cosas. Ya que aún que el driver de AMD está a la altura en optimización para juegos PATROCINADOS, es claro que queda mucho por hacer en algunos otros apartados, en donde la gráfica se siente capada por falta de optimización de la empresa (casos notables; Counter-Strike con FPS mínimos que son ridículos, o Vampire Suvivors que incluso en modo ventana presenta trabas y algunos bugs visuales, inaceptables para un juego de 8 bits).En general, la compra es recomendada para todos aquellos que quieran un gama alta que esté relevante durante muchos años. Sus 20 GBs de VRAM me van a ayudar muchísimo en lo profesional y su enfriador, a pesar de ser el de referencia, realiza un trabajo más que aceptable dejando las cosas por debajo de 80°CActualización 1.- RTX 4070tiCreo que es relevante que hable un poco de la nueva gráfica de ""gama media"" de Nvidia y porque creo, que aún con la existencia de la misma, la RX 7900 XT es indudablemente la mejor opción.Cosas en donde NVIDIA hace mejor las cosas con su nueva gráfica;1.- Soporte para tecnología privativa; NVECH y de más opciones de trabajo profesional o causal de video. Más algunas cosas únicas en el mundo profesional (CUDA), son mejores en NVIDIA, en una diferencia únicamente importante para PROFESIONALES especializados en esas áreas.2.- A nivel de Drivers, NVIDIA lo hace mejor en lo que respecta en optimización.Cosas que hace mejor AMD con respecto de NVIDIA.1.- Superposición en juegos e integración. Con Nvidia, presionas las teclas ALT+Z y te lanza un menú llamado Shadowplay que te permite grabar, iniciar a grabar repeticiones de jugadas, stremear o tener métricas de seguimiento de rendimiento.AMD le muestra a Intel y a NVIDIA cómo se deben hacer las cosas y como se puede ser mil veces mejor. En el mismo software puedes hacer lo mismo que hace NVIDIA, con el mismo comando, sumado a qué las métricas son infinitamente más completas, trabajadas, y funcionales, permitiendo guardar todo el seguimiento en un txt. Permite EDITAR los videos grabados, generado archivos de audio separados para editores más exigentes. Permite aplicar undervolt, overclock, perfiles de OC personalizados, y perfiles de bajo consumo y de baja sonoridad POR JUEGO, aplicando también configuraciones a nivel driver que se gustan POR JUEGO, todo desde la misma app del driver (adiós MSI Afterburner).Todo esto, de forma gratuita, segura (porque la gráfica guarda un perfil ""de stock"" que carga en automático si detecta problemas), y con una integración absolutamente brillante, haciendo que el usuario lo pueda usar sin necesidad de cuentas de correo electrónico ridículas que te llenan de publicidad (te estoy mirando a ti, NVIDIA).2.- La gráfica de AMD es hasta 18% más rápida que la 4070ti. Cosa muy importante porque solo cuesta 10% más. Sumado a ello, tiene 20 GBs de VRAM contra los 12 de la opción verde. Esto, en 4K se nota y muchísimo.3.- Como mencioné antes, la gráfica de AMD es infinitamente más pequeña y no usa un conector privativo que tiene problemas de quemado en PCs (miren la 4090, por ejemplo).La opción lógica si no eres editor de video de un streamer es sin duda AMD, para jugar es la opción lógica.[Aquí lo dejo de momento, si hay otra cosa que mencionar, actualizaré a la brevedad]', ""Spiele immer mit QHD (2.560 x 1.440) Auflösung (3 Monitore angeschlossen) und bei Spielen wie Assassin's Creed Valhalla/Odyssey bei mittlerer bis hoher Grafikeinstellung ist die Karte bei 60 bis 70% ausgelastet (68 °C) und erst dann sind die Lüfter hörbar.

You can fit one fan in the front, but the entire back side is off limits with this.-It's sturdy enough, but not really strong.  And yes, as others have said, the GPU slot being suspended between two supports sometimes leads to bad contact of the GPU pins and thus computer problems.  Once you seat the card and it works it seems to stay working, but I had to reseat it several times while starting up initially because the gpu would not register.-The riser cable is too long.

First, my EVGA 2070 Super was dumping all its exhaust heat into the chipset cooler for my x570 motherboard. Secondly, my video card is heavy and even with three slots holding it up, it would sag. I chose this vertical mount over the Phanteks and Cooler Master because they only support two slot cards. I mounted it as intended, to the floor of the case. I managed to find a Noctua A9 x14 chromax fan to place under it without upsetting the mount and this is perfect. My temps have dropped to 63C on my GPU, Chipset temp is in the 40's and CPU tops at 73C on Arctic Freezer ii 360. I am very pleased that I can hit these numbers with a mild OC in a uncontrolled environment (office off my garage)"", 'This is good but when u have fans at the bottom you can’t install this with a part it comes with that straighten it , without it the right part on the gpu comes down a bit, mine used to touch the middle fan with the foam part at the bottom on the mount and make a sound but I turn the fan to intake and it fixed the problem since it was resting on the back side of the fan and not on the blades']"

The light color can be changed or turned off with Velocity X which you can also use to overclock and while it isn't really as good as something like MSI Afterburner it's usable and it's a good nice to have nonetheless. The reason why I returned it was because the prices of the Rtx 3060ti were dropping and I kind of paid the price of a 3060ti for this card ($389 - $420 with taxes). But right now you can find an Rtx 3060ti for like $470 which is only like 70 bucks above msrp for 30% more performance. In my opinion the Rtx 3060ti is the way to go but if you can't fork up about $500 (including taxes into that price) then this card isn't so far behind and is a great card for 1080p max settings 100+ fps for games like warzone, bloodhunt, and apex. (You should get more fps in big map BR games like the ones listed with a good cpu since they are more cpu intensive). Just make sure your cpu is pretty good and doesn't bottleneck this card and a 550w psu is the minimum psu spec from nvidia which you should consider if you plan on overclocking just a little bit or if your cpu has a high power usage. But all in all this card is great and should last a long while since it has 12gb of ddr6 memory.

Do mind that if you intend to give the game to a friend if it isn't your kind of game and you're getting this card for yourself, to first redeem it through AMD's website, and then once the steam key is available give it to them that way, as AMD has a checker in place that scans for the GPU installed to ensure that it's the same one you're redeeming the code for.

The 4070Ti was the best price/performance/power consumption ratio by far, so much so that it was a no brainer for me to settle for it over the 4090.  I'm keeping this review shorter than I normally would, since even though I'm an expert at this point I think im just gonna give the main points here and not get overly specific.1)To be competetive in the new AI machine learning world nvidia has a distinct advantage, I'm glad im not struggling with a higher specced AMD card without the damn drivers to give me all the massive speed and efficiency increases that these NVIDIA drivers give me, period.  Sry I love AMD too and my chip is nothing other than the meaty and equally mighty Threadripper, but Iove and need are two different things and I need performance and compatibility guaranteed out of anything I pay 800 bucks for.2)Since I'm developing AI based products my mileage will vary from anyone buying this to play a videogame with, all I can say is I wish i had 800 bucks to waste on videogames lol.  I'm sure the card is a beast on videogames too but i honestly just wouldn't know, I did a vanity benchmark on some free new TombRaider game that I'll never play and was pleased that the fps was through the roof at highest settings and stopped to reminisce an actually play in some ultrasmooth Borderlands before I got back to work.3)The price :(4)Amazon extended me some credit to buy it over a few payments, so these past four months have been the most productive months in my company's history due to being able to afford this equipment that has been performing solidly and reliably nonstop almost 24/7 since purchase.5)Finally, the 1800 dollar question.  Do I regret, after 4 months buying this unit over the 4900?  The honest answer is this:  Yes, but hell no.  Yes, If I had a card twice as fast as this one I wouldn't burst into tears of sadness.  But no, I would burst into tears of sadness if it cost me my only remaining kidney what am I supposed to pee with NVIDIA and AMD?  Does the 4900 come with a mechanical kidney or at least a promo code towards one instead of FIFA 2026?  If so then ok I wish I would've bought the 4900 even thought it would have cost twice the power to use 24/7, so my power company will be twice as happy.  I honestly dont know, if I have more customers then the 4090 may become a necessity, but I'm not looking forward to it.6)There u have it, I hope even though it only covered the basics, like yes if you get it for machine learning you will be very glad you did and have a card that is more than capable of cranking out professional production level product with efficiency, speed, power savings, economical, plug and play compatibility with every thing type of performance.  you're welcome.

The ASUS TUF RTX 3070 Ti has earned its place as a crucial tool in my 3D artist's toolkit, and I highly recommend it to anyone in the creative field looking to elevate their work to new heights."", 'I like it. It’s quiet can’t really hear it. It brings good fps to the games', 'Brand new, the packaging flawless in terms of no bruising or damage while in transit. Easy installation, but will have to invest in a 240mm AIO radiator in the near future to keep noise levels and potential hot temperatures down (regardless how much I love the look of the stock radiator and the TUF logo lighting up). It has tiny switch that can toggle for ""Performance"" or ""Quietness"".As far as games go; my personal targeted games:Halo Infinite - I really wanted to spoil Halo Infinite\'s open ring world and cut scenes being able to game at 1440p Ultra Settings which I found this card is more than perfect for (70fps min in really tense situations - high 90fps for lesser dense areas).Cyberpunk 2077 - This card targeted everything on Ultra for 1440p and it was struggle for the most part. I had to go in and tune down the Ray Tracing and turn off the Motion Blur. It\'s hard to say concretely what settings makes this game playable with smooth FPS, so I\'ll leave this for TBD.Red Dead Redemption 2 - This card maxed out everything and it runs beautifully on 1440p (best to have 32GB of RAM to reduce the stutter and freezing moments, my personal opinion)For now, this card is right for me and I\'m glad I scored it when I did and I\'m very satisfied!', ""Title says it all. It's a heavy old gal, but your case should be able to support it. If desired, there are GPU holders for these big cards.For those who aren't as technically aware (like me), this thing won't simply be powered by the PCI slot it goes into. It takes a dedicated connection to your power supply. But that's good; this thing has a lot of power behind it, able to run flight simulators with ease. Those programs are very GPU intensive, and I get no less than 44 FPS in X-Plane 12 on high settings.When I say this thing's quiet, I mean I never hear it.

Seems like I have received an open box item. The plastic tape around the card is still on the card but that doesnt mean anything since the fans can still move air and the card can run with it still applied. I just hope this card was not heavily used.I did read a review from another customer that was in this same situation.

I figured I would wait for the 4000 series, but I probably made a mistake and only got a 750 watt power supply, and from what I hear, I probably could only get a 4060 when they come out, because 4000 series are supposed to be very power hungry. Who knows what the availability/pricing will be for a 4060, and I didn’t want to wait another ~ year for similar card.I am very happy with the card, and VR is great :-)', 'Got it for $35 above the MSRP, but it’s still a great deal compared to the insane prices we were asked to pay since the 3xxx series release and up to a week ago.

Capite bene, che per chi come me tende a non cambiare scheda video molto spesso, acquistare una scheda che ora funziona benissimo in 2k e domina il 1080p, anche fra qualche anno non avrà problemi a reggere giochi in qualità alta o massima.-PRESTAZIONI E TEMPERATURE, CONSUMIHo effettuato diversi benchmark, oltre a provare diversi giochi, e in 1080 la media è sempre bloccata sopra 130-150 fps a qualità massima. Per quanto riguarda le temperature xfx in generale fa ottime custom, di fatto le temperature rimangono piuttosto buone, oscillazione tra i 40 gradi in idle e i 50 max 55 gradi in sessioni di gioco prolungate. Anche i consumi di questa scheda sono più che buoni, in genere rimangono sotto i 150watt e nei casi più estremi sotto i 200watt.-STILELo stile di questa custom in particolare SWFT è semplice, ma elegante. Non dispone di rgb o testi colorati, ma di fatto sono una cosa secondaria tenendo conto del prezzo. Questo non sapevo se metterlo nei pro o i contro poichè dipende dai gusti personali. In ogni caso nonostante la sua semplicità, all\'interno del pc fa la sua figura. Se volete anche gli rgb e loghi colorati dovreste spostarvi sulla fascia successiva di xfx ad esempio QICK e MERC, solo che in quel caso al prezzo che costano potete comprare una rx6800xt, quindi non so effettivamente quanto conviene.-BUNDLE AMDAttualmente questo venditore e questa scheda aderiscono al bundle AMD per ricevere una key gratuita di STARFIELD premium edition.VENDITORE/SPEDIZIONI:Il venditore è cordiale, e la spedizione abbastanza veloce, ho ordinato la scheda il 13 agosto ed è arrivata il 18 agosto. Lo scatolo è arrivato quasi intatto, tranne una piccola ammaccatura nella zona superiore, ma immagino sia stata colpa del corriere. Immagini allegate.CONTRO:LUNGHEZZA:La scheda risulta comunque molto lunga, intorno ai 34cm, nel mio caso ho avuto qualche difficoltà a farla entrare nel case, ma niente di eccessivo. Quindi prima di acquistarla assicuratevi che vi entri nel case.-RAY TRACING E OTTIMIZZAZIONE SOFTWARE:Purtroppo questa è una nota dolente di amd, con il ray-tracing attivato la scheda va decentemente, ma niente di eccezionale, AMD FSR funziona abbastanza bene, ma comunque non è all\'altezza del DLSS.Purtroppo se vi interessano queste tecnologie amd non è la scelta che fa per voi.CONCLUSIONI QUALITA\'/PREZZO:Globalmente la rx6800 si presenta come un ottima scheda, il prezzo a cui l\'ho acquistata è di 459 euro ed attualmente è un best buy su questa fascia di prezzo. Tenendo conto che fa di media dai 20-50 fps in più rispetto alla RTX 4060TI da 16GB su quasi la stragrande maggioranza dei giochi, e con un prezzo di circa 100 euro in meno. Quindi questa scheda è ottima per chi vuole giocare senza compromessi da oggi fino ai prossimi anni, rinunciando però a volte al ray-tracing e a qualche ottimizzazione software.', 'A rare review from me, only my second since joining Amazon a long time ago.

The card performs brilliantly.Now onto the seller. I was worried at first as they are outside the UK, based in Portugal I believe. But the card arrived within the expected delivery time, and the support team have been fantastic in helping me claim my Starfield Code via the ""AMD Raise the Game"" promotion, which this seller is taking part in.

This thing is so powerful that it barely, if at all, turned the fans on enough to trigger the lighting effects, because I just couldn't find a game demanding enough to utilize a majority of the card. Gave it four stars because that issue isn't presented in any easily addressable way, but the performance is perfect so far after about 2 weeks."", '𝗦𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄:Amazing. Well-built. Less offensively priced than much of the competition. Not loud, and despite a bit of coil whine during certain loading screens, it hasn\'t been noticeable while playing. As someone who wanted to avoid coil whine and bought this card for that reason, I\'m fine with it.It\'s a real, solid 4090 for not much above MSRP, with performance and silent BIOS modes.--------------------------------------------------𝗟𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄:I\'m currently running this in my nearly 4-year old build, with the intention of upgrading everything else around the card after a year or so of saving.Even on an i9 9900k, it offers massive gains over my 2080 ti in any scenario where I\'m not limited by my CPU or 3200mhz ram speed. For example, Hogwarts Legacy doesn\'t see too much improvement (it\'s notoriously taxing on your whole system and not the most optimized), but Horizon Zero Dawn at native 1440p Ultra went from 90fps on an RTX 2080 ti to 155fps (monitor cap) on the 4090. It\'s still only around 75% GPU usage, 63C and drawing roughly the same power as my 2080 ti at around 250W.That\'s over a 70% uplift for 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘴𝘢𝘮𝘦 𝘱𝘰𝘸𝘦𝘳 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘶𝘮𝘱𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯, a dozen degrees cooler, and a lot quieter due to much lower fan speed. Aside from obviously flourishing at 4k, this card could do a lot more than that at 1440p with a cutting-edge CPU, RAM and a 240hz monitor. It is a BEAST, and with 24GB of VRAM it may actually stay powerful for a few years.Still, let\'s be real; the 4090 is overpriced and I can\'t give it good marks for value even though Gigabyte is being really cool here compared to the competition. I stand strong in my belief that the whole pricing structure of the 40-series is one tier too high; the FE should retail around $1249-$1299, which would put this one around $1349-$1399. Still, this isn\'t Gigabyte\'s fault, it\'s Nvidia all the way, and I appreciate Gigabyte offering this for a comparatively ""reasonable"" price.If you decided (like I did) that the 4090 is the only card that makes sense to buy for longevity\'s sake—or you simply want the best—this is a great option.', 'Pues fusión muy bien a pesar de los detalle de como vino el empaque maltratada', 'Very good card and is a very economical choice to run AI on as well as excellent peformanxe in graphical applications.', 'What else can I say?It’s a 4090.Do you want to get robbed paying an extra $600 for the Asus strix, or would you rather Pay nearly MSRP for the gigabyte.The choice is yours.', 'The virtues and vices of the 4090 I think are well know at this point: gigantic, power hungry, expensive, and prone to fire, but also a massive leap in computational and gaming performance compared to the 3090 and RDNA2. The Gigabyte Gaming OC shares those qualities along with every other 4090 on the market.Why buy this card? What sets it apart from the competition? As far as I can tell, not much that matters. It has a good cooler, has fairly quiet fans, a dual bios, and a beefier than reference VRM more than capable of providing 600w+ should you decide you aren’t spending enough on your electricity bill. The included brace is a nice touch, though it may not work in smaller cases. However, every 4090 is overbuilt and more than capable of handing stock settings (which, to be clear, there is no point in deviating from). There are several MSRP or near MSRP 4090s that basically offer most if not all of the same.To answer my own question, the reason to buy this card is its reputation for having little if any coil whine. Having owned 2 Gigabyte 4090 Gaming OC cards, I have a larger sample than most. I can say with confidence that said reputation is entirely unearned. The Gaming OC howls like a banshee. I have mine in a steel sound dampened case; if I did not, the thing would drive me insane. The first Gaming OC I had was returned do to very, very abnormal VRAM temperatures. It was probably missing a thermal pad, but I was not going to void my warranty replacing it.About Gigabyte. Gigabyte’s software is horrendous. The fan curve on both profiles leaves a lot to be desired. The first Gaming OC I bought had to be returned likely due to a missing/misplaced thermal pad. The second (which I kept) has an anti-tampering sticker that is barely on from the factory—how does Gigabyte manage to mess up the application of a sticker? And my warranty depends on it? Sure, in the US the anti-tampering thing isn’t legal, but give me a break: companies ignore that law all of the time.In summary, there really isn’t much reason to buy this card should it be selling meaningfully above MSRP. It has awful coil whine like every other card, it is made by a company that doesn’t care at all about their customers just like every other card, but does the 4090 stuff so many of us are willing to pay a premium for, just like every other card. There is nothing special about it.', ""Loves:- Power- Thermal stability- Run everything with highest settings- ML performanceDislikes:- Way too expensive- Bulky, had to buy a larger case to fit it- Ships with a horrible power connectorWith the last item, it's really critical that, if you have a case that fits with minimal clearance to the edge of the GPU, the power port will be facing right at the PC case.  The cord that this GPU ships with comes straight out, forcing you to bend it at 90 degrees to fit. This places stress on the power connector and the cord, and could be responsible for some of the arcing / cable fires that have been reported.Instead of bending the cable, I purchased this:JOYJOM PCI-e 5.0 12VHPWR 16 Pin Right Angle Adapter Female to Male Extension Cable, 16AWG 600W 12VHPWR 90 Degree Adapter for Graphic Card GPU 12+4pin RTX 3090Ti 4070Ti 4080 4090 (Type B)This extension cable is designed with a 90 degree connector, and solves all the problems.Gigabyte should really be shipping this.  Or at least, don't ship their existing cable, and drop the price."", ""So I got this card when it first came out. I actually had to get a different case, because the 4090s are so very big....and not in length, as was typically issue with GPUs - but the height of the card. How tall it is. Because the 12vHPWR plug port is at the top of the card, and you can't really bend that cable because of the issue around the plugs melting if you don't get a good seat on that power plug - I actually had to get a different case to give me more room. And custom soft sleeved power cable that is more flexible than my stock PSU's cable. Even with that, about 7 months in - I start having issues. After diagnosing, my power cable had come slightly unseated at one end and melted the plug. It was the cable side of the plug, but it caused a little damage to the cards 12vHPWR port. It still worked, but I didn't feel good about the longevity of it. I opened a case with Gigabyte, they issued an RMA, and about 2 weeks later I had a card with a new power port."", 'Works awesome, obviously overpriced, but don’t have much of a choice for other high end cards. Make sure it fits in your case though. I have a full tower that is about the size of a suitcase, and it fits about perfect in this setup']"

Now I'm getting 100 to 170 fps in Cyberpunk and 200+ on BG3 both on settings fully maxed out. Its awesome.Noise: Quieter than the 2080 with dual fan on full speed.Looks: Really glad I got one of the last batch of white, matches most of the rest of my innards quite well. The RGB is an extra I don't really care about but is nice to have.Size: I'm assuming the V2 is longer than the V1 and that I received a V2. V1 length I should have had enough room with the fans right in front of it. I had to separate the 2 front fans to bring one down and the other one up (which works out for airflow logic, 1 bringing fresh air for gpu and 1 for above gpu area). Its pretty long. Case is a Thermaltake S100 for a micro atx board and i'd say it fits perfectly. No need for the support stand it comes with since I got the edge sitting on top of the case fan for support.Conclusion: If you're upgrading from anything from a 3060 ti or under I would say its worth it imho."", ""When it comes to Nvidea 40 series cards, you have 2 choiices.

At $800.00 msrp it performs at a level between the 3090 & 3090 ti, both of which still cost $1000.00 + if you can find them.I paid $770.00 for this card & performance wise I couldn't be happier. In addition, this Galax card comes with an oversized cooler that works. Stock, it never even hits 70c. It also draws the same amount of power as the 3060 ti it replaced, negating the need for a power supply upgrade. When I run it overclocked, the fans are noisy. About the same as a window mounted air conditioner. The temps hit 71c as well. Stock, you'll rarely hear them. The top 2 AMD cards will outperform it, till you turn on reytracing.

I’m 67 years old, an in my retirement decided to take the plunge into an 800 dollar pool of graphics technology. Folks complain about the price, and rightfully so, but I paid 1200 bucks for the 2080ti new. That’s the market, which by all indicators is not going to change.  What changed in this case was the third party manufacturer – not EVGA (of course), Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, Zotac, et al…but instead, PNY.  PNY…hmmm.  Well, why not.  The Asus TUF version was the same price, but waiting a month wasn’t appealing.  Getting a hold of the PNY in 2 days was.  So, after researching a little bit for reviews of the PNY model, which in all cases were glowing (except for complaints about the cost), decided to give it a try.  So far so good! First of all, I do more productivity stuff like video editing and encoding, 3D rendering, and Paintshop, than gaming.  That the memory bus width on this card is 192bit and not 352bit like the 2080ti worried me a little, but not anymore. Encoding and rendering times were substantially lower, 20-30 percent depending on the application.  Not bad.  Of course, the kid in me ran the card through the 3DMark gamut just for fun.  The particular card I bought overclocks to +205 Mhz GPU clock and +1300 Mhz MEM clock stable, anything above either setting crashes it...your results may differ a bit, depending on your luck with the silicon lottery.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND you try this, at the risk of voiding your warranty if physical damage occurs as a result, regardless of what make you buy.  These cards have a failsafe that shuts it down before that can happen, but you never know. Anyway, my benchmark results were good enough to get me a number 1 ranking on Time Spy or Time Spy Extreme, can’t remember, on similar systems (4070ti + I7 12700K).  If you have a 3dMark account, take a look :)  Other thoughts:1.  The unit is bulky, long, heavy, and takes up 3 slots of mobo space, due to its enormous cooler. Ships with a support bracket if you’re worried about sagging.  I used tie wraps attached to a drive cage. Looks weird, but works.2. Very quiet, surprisingly.  I’m using a custom fan curve with MSI Afterburner that keeps the fans off until 35 degrees (Celsius). Idles at 27-30 degrees depending on ambient temp. At 50% fans, just airflow noise…no discernible coil whine (but these are 67 year old ears)3.When outrageously OCing, reached 280W.  As I type this, a quick look at hardware monitor shows 4.2 watts at 31 degrees, no fans running per above. Btw default is 30% fans (1000rpm) ramping up with temp.4. System: I7-12700K, this graphics card, Asus TUF z690 DDR5 mobo, 32Gb TeamGroup T-force DDR5-5200 RAM, Samsung 980 Pro 2TB M.2 system drive, Scythe Fuma2 air cooling, Corsair HX850W Platinum power supply.Overall, I’m impressed with the PNY version and will give it 5 stars.  If  something occurs later with this graphics card that’s un-impressing, I will update this review.2 1/2 Months later..nothing to report.  Everything's fine. My only beef with PNY is trying to sell a factory overclocked card for 50 bucks more. In short, it's the EXACT SAME card with altered firmware. I retired from IT and industrial electronics after 40 years, and I can tell you you're wasting 50 bucks on the OCed version. You can easily OC to the more expensive version, and way beyond, with software tools like Afterburner. Having said this, I still admire PNY for manufacturing what has been an excellent version of Nvidia's 4070ti architecture, which originally was supposed to be the 4080 12GB. This is an NVidia thing, not PNY. If you are playing games or rendering models, this is, in MHO, all you need."", 'PNY RELIABILITY - I had no initial hesitations when purchasing this PNY-version RTX 4070 Ti.  I currently own a PNY-brand GTX 970, which still works fine to this day.  Of course, I had far more apprehensions back then, when I first spent hundreds of dollars for that 970.  Now, I purchase PNY brand hardware with moderate assurance.DIMENSIONS - This is a monstrous card, when coming from the GTX 970 - which I thought was huge back then.  My 4070 Ti is about 13"" long, 5"" wide, and 2.5"" high.  I highly suggest purchasing a support bracket, as it will put a lot of strain on the motherboard otherwise.  I personally went with this: \'BERLAT Graphics Card Brace Support\'.PERFORMANCE - I have a 1080p monitor only, so I\'m not going to tackle 4k resolutions at the moment.  I also just wanted a video card that I can simply PnP without having to adjust any settings to get 100FPS plus performance.  I play the following games currently, and they perform at or above 100FPS easily: Borderlands 3, Aliens: Fireteam Elite, Gears of War 4, and Final Fantasy XIV.BUYER\'S REMORSE? - I do have some, in that I should have waited for the regular RTX 4070 - I didn\'t know it was going to drop literally 2-weeks after I purchased this 4070 Ti.  Nvidia is definitely price-gouging their GPU customers this generation - the RTX 4070 Ti is not performing at an $800 level.  Perhaps if it had a 256-bit bus and 16GBs of RAM, I would be more amendable.  As it stands, I would have been more content with the RTX 4070 for the price/performance ratio.RECOMMENDATION - I would say if you\'re strictly playing at 1080p like I am, the RTX 4070 would be the more cost-effective option.  I certainly would have purchased that, if I was more aware of my options._______________________________________________________________________________________________Update: June 4th, 2023:CURRENT STATUS - It\'s working fine.  I\'ve had no issues outside of some games - no glitches, flickering, and/or sudden blackouts in desktop mode. Certain games are giving me performance issues, but that seems to be more related to the games themselves.3440 X 1440 RESOLUTION - Yes, I now game at 1440p, as I\'ve upgraded to this monitor:\'LG UltraGear QHD 34-Inch Curved Gaming Monitor 34GP83A-B\'.  I am also currently playing Assassin\'s Creed Odyssey. Minus the occasional dips to 80FPS in Odyssey, it stays 99% of the time above 100FPS on high settings.  Other games like Back 4 Blood, is always performing at or above 120FPS.FAN NOISE - It is virtually silent outside of gaming.  If I put my ear near to the case, you can hear fans, but is it from the graphics card?  I can\'t tell.  Even when gaming at 1440p, I\'ve never heard it whirl loudly.  I don\'t believe I\'m putting any strain on my RTX 4070 Ti, even at high settings with the games I\'m playing.BUYER\'S REMORSE?  - Basically, instead of having buyer\'s remorse, I bought a new monitor to take advantage of this card\'s potential. Now, I don\'t have as much buyer\'s remorse - but I do still maintain that Nvidia has overpriced all the 4000 series cards.  For an $800 price tag, I should have 4080 hardware.  Besides that caveat, I\'m continuing to enjoy my new gaming setup.', 'Built a new PC, Heard EVGA left the GPU Market.

Was paired with a 4k 120hz LG C2 and I was extremely surprised by it's 4k performance, and frame gen makes it even more of a powerhouse. To those not in the know this technology inserts ai generated frames in between each traditionally rendered frame, and unless you're analyzing frame by frame you will not be able to tell the difference in motion, but you will feel it!As for regular dlss, I refuse to use that feature since I'm extremely set off by visual artifacts and inconsistencies ( hense why I've already upgraded from this to the pny 4080).Not much else to be said, card is all you'll need for years to come for 1440p high refresh rate, and also does extremely well in 4k. People claiming that this doesn't have enough vram have no idea how vram works. Settings in games are showing an allocation when it's represented on screen, but much like the ram on your motherboard, not all of this will be in use at all times. The only time you will run into a ram limiting situation is at 4k max settings with heavy amounts of raytracing (cyberpunk with psycho for example). But honestly this card shouldn't be using the absolute max settings on everything in 4k for the most demanding title on the planet anyway.Just buy it."", 'I had no issues installing this bad boi in my rig, first boot no problems, no driver issues, no crashes, no tuning required.

Released in the middle of the crypto mining graphics card shortage.Its basically a slightly reduced 3090 with half of the video ram (VRAM) of 12GB instead of 24. 12GB is more than enough for 4k gaming and content creation, and content creators should probably be looking at the A-series gpus for that purpose.You get a few fewer CUDA cores and whatnot, but not materially different from the 3090.It DOES draw less power and makes less heat, and only has memory on the one side with the gpu instead of on both sides of the card, which reduces heat and may actually enable it to beat the 3090 in some benchmarks.A 3080 12GB does the job, but the 3080 ti\'s I find drop to very attractive prices, as this did during the July 2022 Prime Day.After extensive measurements, I am seeing a 340W max power draw, a 72C high thermal point in my case, and the included Firestrike software (which looks a lot like Afterburner) got an extra 100MHz of gpu clock over the standard, so it was peaking at just slightly over 2GHz. Impressive given it\'s spec\'d 1800 and some.Running at full bore in a wide open case with all of the panels off, and an aquarium 20\' behind me making a bubbling sound, it\'s barely audible. Once the panels are back on, which I\'ll either get to in 2023 or 2024, I\'m sure the noise will be fairly inaudible.Performs on par with the now unlaunched 4080 12GB, for $400 less and with no power connectors that might turn your computer into a roman candle.The one thing that gave me a moments trouble was that the cards heat sink bumped into the humongous heat sink on the nvme ssd on my motherboard, while the old gpu didn\'t. So I had to take that off and use a smaller heatsink. So be aware that the heat sink is very close to the board near the slots it takes up.I took this as a ""smart buy"" as a near halo product at a significant discount. While I was tempted by a 6900XT, the two cards trade blows and the 3080ti is the superior card at ray tracing.Most computers with a 750w or 850w power supply can probably pull this off. I wasn\'t seeing anything higher than 339 watts of total power draw, most of that through the two standard 8-pin connectors.Several benchmarks measured this card in the top 15% percentile performance-wise, beating out 85% of other 3080 ti\'s.If you have bad case cooling, or your case can\'t take a long card then it\'s probably not what you want. If you want to save money and ray tracing isn\'t in your future, the 6900XT might save you a few bucks and give good results.', 'This has been the most powerful gpu for the price I have ever had, a little expensive but it fits most common motherboard.

Last year during The Great GPU Shortage, I bought a 165hz/1440p monitor which was a small oversight as my GPU clearly couldn’t even handle my monitor. Fast forward to now, I recently got a pay bonus from work and was back in the computer component market after seeing that GPU prices had dropped significantly. I’m very content with the price I paid for this 3080. Now onto the GPU itself.The negatives:- It is quite the space heater. A factor might be that I temporarily moved my setup into my bedroom from the office/studio to accommodate a guest. I also have case fans manually set to 100%, so I might tinker with that a little bit. It raised the ambient temperature of my room by probably around 5-10 degrees Fahrenheit (yeah pretty bad).- It’s a CHONKER. GPU sag may occur. I bought a bracket/riser after I received it, since I didn’t know how large it would be.- Not really a negative, but please, please buy a PROPER power supply to support this card. I’ve heard horror stories.The positives:- The performance is awesome, I’m actually able to reach 165 fps + 1440p on most games if I tweak the settings a little bit. I’ve been playing Forza Horizon 5 a lot and I have it set to mostly the highest settings (there’s a driver bug with the game currently, no biggie, barely see any difference anyway) and I get over 140 fps on average.- Ray-tracing! It’s a given but honestly, I only turn this on for non-competitive games and if I don’t mind being below my personal target of 120-144 fps.- The noise! It’s been really quiet for the most part, but keep in mind that I previously said I had the case fans set to 100% so that’s probably drowning the GPU fans out. Your mileage may vary here.- Streaming/recording! I really like NVENC. While my previous card also had NVENC, it could not keep up streaming while gaming. I also have a Ryzen 5 3600 (yes I know I’m slightly bottlenecking, I have heard this many times), and while that CPU is a beast, it just simply doesn’t like being put to the streaming/recording tasks solo when gaming. It needs it’s good ol’ GPU encoder friend.- I’ve owned 3 EVGA cards now including this one, and they’ve all been reliable so far. EVGA gets a plus here for that.In conclusion, get this card if you have the capable budget and/or you’re looking to get some massive upgrade gains. Like I said, I don’t have the best CPU to support this, but it’s been working great so far.', ""Update 7/27/22I decided to order a new display port to HDMI cable(I use a 4k Sony TV) to just see if my other 4k HDMI cables were for some reason not working right.

Out of nowhere my screen starts to strobe and flicker, then it went solid green. I restarted the computer and got this beautiful image.I tried different cables, but this is all I see. I installed the old trusty 970 again with the first cable, and it works just fine. I tried putting them both in at the same time to access the settings for each card while I can actually see anything. Everything is up to date and it claims from device manager to be working but this is the only video output I see from the card. Tried different monitors and a TV. Reinstalled drivers, changed the resolution and refresh rate. Went back into that game and reset settings. I don't know what else there is to try.I've always bought EVGA cards after my first fiasco into PC building when I had to replace a dead card with an EVGA GTX 460, then I had 2 GTX 660ti SSC cards, and my 970. I have never been let down until now. I'm not really sure if I should just try a replacement, or a different brand altogether.

scomodare la sorella maggiore RTX 4090 creata per un pubblico digamer molto di nicchia e perfetta in ambito professionale considerandola qualtità di Ram a bordo,si può asserire con cognizione di causa cheal momento la RTX 4080 di casa Nvidia è la scheda grafica più completae performante tra quelle presenti sul mercato,per ""completa"" intendole prestazioni che si ottengono sfruttando le tecnologie comeRayTracing,DLSS e generatore di frame aggiuntivi tramite IA.Questo specifico modello (vedi foto) della PNY® è basato sullespecifiche originali del modello ""Founder Edition"" di casaNvidia,da quì in avanti per comodità di lettura,abbreviatoin ""FE"".In parole molto semplici ha le stesse caratteristiche(frequenza di clock del chip e clock delle ram) delmodello venduto da Nvidia sul loro sito ufficiale.in sintesi non presenta overclock di fabbrica di nessun tipo,tuttavia differisce in termini di dissipazione e ventole dalmodello ""FE"",e nell\'aspetto è più simile alla moltitudine dimodelli ""custom"" presenti sul mercato.PNY insieme a pochi altri marchi ha aderito alla ""clausola"" diNvidia di mettere a listino almeno un modello di RTX 4080custom con le specifiche originali della ""FE"",scelta commercialeper poter proporre ai futuri clienti almeno un modello ""base""senza fronzoli estetici e/o overclock ma mantenendo le stesseprestazioni e prezzi (ove possibile) quanto più vicinial modello di riferimento di Nvidia.Ma chi è PNY® ?PNY® è una società americana con sede nel New Jersey,operante sulmercato dal 1985,inizialmente comprando e vendendo chip di memoria.nel corso degli anni cresce sul mercato locale aprendo altre sediin california e Florida.Si affaccia sul mercato europeo con unasuccursale in Francia e nel mercato asiatico tramite una sede aTaiwan.Purtroppo per noi italiani,qualsiasi comunicazione con PNY andràeffettuata tramite contatti con la sede Americana,tuttavia i prodottiPNY sono venduti e spediti da Amazon,e al netto che non siano cambiatele politiche ""dell\'azienda che più ha a cuore i suoi clienti"",per qualsiasiproblema di natura tecnica dovrebbe farsene carico Amazon,almeno nei primi due anni di garanzia come da legge Europea.Ciò detto illustro a grandi linee com\'è fatta questa scheda grafica:La lunghezza è di 34 centimetri,prendetene atto perchè non entreràin qualsiasi case,inoltre c\'è da considerare il nuovo connettoreda 12 pin,come tutte le RTX 40XX è posto al centro,è di tipo""rinforzato"" nei pressi del connettore pertanto non avrà un grossomargine di piegatura almeno nei primi 2 cm,quindi se montatadirettamente nello slot PCI avrà uno spessore maggiore versoil vetro o la paratia del case aumentandone lo spessore,anchequesto è un aspetto che va tenuto presente,ovviamente valeper qualsiasi modello (che sia FE o custom) di RTX 40XX.Il peso è l\'altra variabile da tenere presente,se su molte schede madridi fascia alta lo slot PCI è adeguatamente rinforzato,su molti modellipiù economici non lo è,e dato il peso importante potrebbe pendere inmodo sensibile sul lato destro,nel tempo potrebbe anche danneggiarela mobo o lo slot PCI quindi se è il vostro caso,munitevi preventivamentedi una staffa di sostegno,in quanto in questo modello non sono previstisupporti di tenuta in confezione sempre per il discorso del ""modello base""discusso poco sopra.In verità in confezione c\'è una piccola staffetta in metallo (vedi foto) madate le dimensioni e funzionalità non dà l\'impressione di essere adeguatamentevalida o almeno non quanto le soluzioni aftermarket da poche decine di euro.Backplace posteriore: Quà PNY non ha lesinato,è in alluminio spazzolatoscuro (vedi foto) e con un buono spessore 👍Il frontplace anteriore dove risiedono anche le ventole è totalmente inplastica,nulla di scandaloso a dire il vero,anche marchi più blasonatie costosi spesso adottano questa soluzione per contenere il peso.Tre buone ventole a 12 pale curve si integrano molto benenella struttura,struttura spigolosa e con molti scalini chese pur completamente di colore nero rendono un filino menoanonimo l\'aspetto generale.Nella zona del connettore troviamo la sigla PNY retro illuminata di bianco,colore che non può ne essere cambiato ne essere spento,così è e così ce lodobbiamo tenere.A seguire sempre sullo stesso lato c\'è la scritta GEFORCE RTX stampata di biancosulla struttura,non si illumina,è proprio semplicemente stampata e nulla più.Le uscite video sono le medesime presenti su tutte le RTX 40XX e le prestazionigenerali sono le medesime viste e lette in tantissime recensioni della RTX 4080 FE,quindi ""ESAGERATE"" per la sua generazione se sfruttate con il giusto hardware e allagiusta risoluzione (2k e 4K) pertanto non mi dilungo oltre modo.PNY offre un software per la gestione della scheda,sulla falsa riga del software diMSI Afterburner,si può variare il clock di GPU e ram,modificare la velocità delle ventolee fare un test per rilevare il giusto overclock senza oltrepassare i limiti tecnici.Sì perchè anche se questa scheda è una ""reference"" della ""FE"" è possibile un minimo di overclock,nell\'ordine di un 4/5%,e con un pò di competenza si può arrivare anche ad un 6/7% ma le prestazionigenerali sono già così ampiamente abbondanti che non se ne sentirà la necessità,inoltre serviràanche un buon alimentatore (750/850Watt gold) per poter spingere un filino di più.Non ho altro da evidenziare se non che volendo,si può montare anche in verticale (vedi foto)tuttavia anche in questo caso le dimensioni generali della scheda e quel connettore richiedonoqualche sacrificio: Se avete il dissipatore della CPU di quelli abbondanti meglio lasciar perdere,quel connettore poco flessibile andrà a rovinare ""esteticamente"" la visione delle vostre RAM.Comunque dato il prezzo al momento si costoso ma in veloce discesa (1.249,99€) e la buona qualitàrealizzativa,se non siete amanti degli RGB,di quel 5/6% di potenza in più di fabbrica chealtri marchi vi fanno pagare a peso d\'oro giustificato anche da orpelli estetici moltosoggettivi e che a molti non interessano, a mio modo di vedere questo modello di PNYpotrebbe essere una valida alternativa per entrare nel mondo della serie RTX40XX conuna spesa ""contenuta"" con molte virgolette 😁 e una resa equiparabile alla ""FE"" di Nvidia.Per ora promossa con ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ stelle,se si presenteranno problemi di natura tecnica tali da essere evidenziati,sarà mia curamodificare questa recensione e tenervi aggiornati.Spero di essere stato utile 👋', 'Also ich habe nun 2 Varianten ausprobiert, die ASUS 4080 TUF und die PNY Verto 4080 OC.Ganz klar fühlt sich so ziemlich alles bei der ASUS Karte wertiger an. Verpackung (sehr viel größer und wertiger ... na ja wer es braucht). Auch die Karte selber wirkte in sich etwas stabiler was Lüfter und Shield anging.Aber was nützt es, das Spulenfiepen war gefühlt (gemessen habe ich es nicht aber eben beide Karten in Cyberpunk 2077 und im 3D-Mark verglichen) doppelt so stark wie bei der PNY.Da die 4080 sehr sehr starke Kühler hat, kann man eigentlich auch die PNY ohne spezielles ""Silent""-Bios nehmen, ich hatte jedenfalls keinen Unterschied im 3D-Mark oder  bei Cyberpunk 2077 bzgl. Lautstärke gemerkt, tatsächlich blieb die PNY Karte bei 30% Lüfterstärke (~1000 RPM und damit im geschlossenen Gehäuse fast nicht hörbar) bei unter 70° (~65° im 3D-Mark Vollast)).Dafür ist die XVelocity Software von PNY wesentlich schlechter als die ASUS GPU Tweak Software (die allerdings überraschender Weise auch mit der PNY-Karte läuft).Was mir bei der PNY besser gefällt ist ansonsten, dass die Karte am Gehäuse mit 3 Schrauben befestigt wird und dadurch irgendwie stabil drin sitzt, ASUS hat das Slotblech nur 2 Einheiten dick gemacht, warum auch immer).Am Ende habe ich die PNY-Karte behalten, aber ansonsten wäre ich bei der ASUS geblieben, die ich auch als erstes hatte, nur war das Spulenfiepen einfach einen tuck zu viel um für mich noch akzeptabel zu sein.Leider scheinen gerade die ASUS-Karten da eine echte Schwäche zu haben. Bei PNY oder Palit liegt man in der Regel besser.Spulenfiepen gibt es bei diesen Karten übrigens immer und ob man es hört oder nicht hängt auch an der Kraft mit der die Lüfter gerade drehen, denn die übertönen das meistens, außer man hat eben gerade ein sehr leises System aufgebaut. Gar kein Spulenfiepen habe ich noch nie gesehen, aber durchaus einige Leute die es nicht hören oder wahrnehmen obwohl es da ist.Die Laustärke der PNY-Karte per se ist IMHO sehr gut, die 4 Sterne für den Geräuschpegel sind dem restlichen Fiepen geschuldet, obwohl ich es nicht mehr als wirklich störend empfunden habe.Also all in all: Kann ich empfehlen, Hauptsache sie hält jetzt dann auch möglichst lange was sie verspricht.', 'Diese 4080 ist eine der günstigsten 4080er, aber hat mich positiv überrascht.Pros:- Sehr leise und kühl, auch unter Last.- Gut verarbeitet. Die Karte ist relativ steif trotz der Dimensionen und des Gewichts und hängt nicht so durch wie es bei großen Grafikkarten häufig der Fall ist. Auch der Shroud wirkt (trotz Kunststoff) erfreulich solide.- Effizient, wie man es von dieser Generation von Karten erwarten kann. Meine alte 3080 die ich zuvor hatte, brachte je nach Titel 30-40 Prozent weniger Leistung bei gleichzeitig deutlich höherem Stromverbrauch.Cons:- Kernspannung und Powerlimit sind auf 100% begrenzt, wodurch Overclocking sehr stark limitiert ist verglichen mit anderen Karten. Mehr als 200-250 mhz OC sind bei meinem Exemplar nicht drin (variiert je nach Titel).Neutral:- Sehr schlichte Optik ohne Schnörkel, RGB etc. Aber das kann man je nach Geschmack auch als Vorteil werten.Fazit:Würde ich definitiv wieder kaufen, die gebotene Leistung und Verarbeitung sind FÜR DEN PREIS sehr gut. Ich hatte zum Vergleich auch kurz eine 4080 von Zotac in Händen, die sich relativ zur PNY wie ein billiges knarzendes Plastikspielzeug angefühlt hat, teurer war und deutlich lauter. So gesehen könnte man sagen: Der Vergleich macht sicher. :)', ""Used mine for quite some time in different gaming scenarios - it has amazing performance, it's cool and quiet. Only complaint - mine has coil whine or some other noise during playing on ultra-settings in 1440p in Red Dead Redemption 2 and Kingdom Come: Deliverance (but there's a slight chance that it's due to me chaining one of power cables as I have only 2 coming from power supply).

Fan\'s are a bit loud when the card is pushing to stay cool but they are not a high pitched sound like other GPU cards I\'ve had. at max settings in Destiny 2 at 2K I\'m getting anywhere between 190-250 fps. Main reason for the upgrade was because of my  3070 being from EVGA and them leaving the gpu space I knew that if I wanted to have the ability to send my card in for warranty repairs in the future I would have to get a card from a different manufacturer.

The highest amount of power that the system draws is 545.5w, so a 850w power supply is more than enough. The card\'s temperature is 69-70 after hours of gaming. If you want to overclock the card even further than the manufacturer buy strix or ftw3 instead because the power limit on this card is only 107% (though I personally think oc does not make much difference in gaming).

I have to question the logic in it.It \'s well built, with an extra port. It\'s assembled on older technology about to be replaced by amd regardless of what nvidia does. MSI, ASUS etc are all refusing the new stuff until they clear the old so they are basically facing off now since TSMC gave nvidia a reprieve. Look there isn\'t a complete intersection between amd and nvidia. Two originally this was 700, but they pushed it up to 1k, and down a little now. Yes it\'s a cut down ti, but here\'s the thing it\'s still not a great value and the cost to make these is 40% of this. This is 800 at this time. It\'s fine to say well i\'ll hang onto it for years, but if you want 3 months you can get something for htis price at 2x the perf and hold it for even more years. It is 2  yearold tech. it really should be 600. Let\'s look at a console, which by the way has cheap games, and you can get them used on disks!Xbox:6700xt370016gb ram1gbssdpsucase and fan=> total cost 450 now.Why should you buy this. Because maybe it\'s for work, or a vr edge case where you need to do something specific or you want premium-premium. I hear you. i like pc gaming too, What i don\'t like is getting price gouged. i compared this to an xbox there is basically no difference in most games. Nobody cares about 800 gpus as devs.  Everyone talks about cyberpunk that\'s like the one case-- fine. I tried that too. I was disappointed with ray tracking. it\'s ok even a little better. is it 400 better, if I\'m honest not really. It\'s not amazing. 4k, xbox does that. They use scalers. who cares it\'s cheap and it works why should I care how they get there. I only care about results.This card isn\'t worth 600 at this point. I \'ve used it. It doesn\'t matter. I really see this as even a last mile. wait for the 4070 next whenever or 7700, 4080 if you must if nvidia wants to play games lets play games. just not the ones we should be playing. Or get it I don\'t really care. I\'m just trying to cut though the hype. As always with amazon you get these one star reviews because someone got something defective or zero issues with the actual product, maybe a seller whatever, or you get a 5 star review because someone just paid 800 and they need to justify their consumerism exuberance.All I\'m saying is check your self before you click buy. Think hard about this it\'s, it s a big purchase, and it\'s not really going to change your life. There are cheaper alternatives.All that said it really is built well. It\'s all metal. you don\'t need higher power limit unless your chasing a few percent and want to deal with the heat and nose. this one in particularly has a fantastic vrm. limited but little extra power, and a create cooler.  That means your getting a ""practical"" 3080 if you can call it practical. I don\'t know of another term. None of these are practical. they are luxuries at this point. 4080 may cost 100 more and be almost 2x the perf and will be around by December in all likely hood. what you are seeing is these aibs releasing things crap to good ad discounts to sell out of junk, so 12gb vents, gigabyte, now evga Asus and higher end stuff. Later it will be the3080 ti s. Then you\'ll see the 3080\'s drop in the later fall when they are worried about used and the new stuff there.

I\'ve also had no power issues with a  750 watt PSU. Do the research and check real power at the wall. I use a P3 Kill A Watt and the system during load testing and long gaming never pulled above 560 watts so far. Be careful of PSU calculators online.

The overall gaming performance was really amazing, and can run any games smoothly in highest setting at 1080p.  Now planning to get a 4K monitor to really test how good this card can be.  Very satisfied.', 'After buying this card I\'m a huge fan af the ASUS TUF Gaming line and might just be sticking with them from here on out! The build quality is incredible.

Right now it\'s one of the best GPUs on the planet.I highly recommend getting something to help with GPU sag with this GPU. I got a ""JEYI Graphics Card Brace Support model: iBrace-8"" here on Amazon for like $8, its a little telescoping thing that takes up like no space it works awesome.For all the details about this card check out hardware unboxed\'s very detailed review of it on YouTube they break it all down, it\'s got very good cooling etc.', ""This card has one of the best air coolers you can get in this price range.  This thing runs cool and quiet and because of that leaves some headroom for tweaking.  It is power limited so there's only so much you'll get, but it's a decent performance increase with very little to no noise associated with it like the other brands (I've tried most).  No hint of coil whine either, which I found is usually associated with your PSU anyway.  Runs good at stock speeds.  Doesn't require extra tweaking to control temps, the factory fan curve is good.  These 12gb variants are being discontinued, so if you don't want to wait for the 4k series and can get one at a decent price then go for it."", ""Item was delivered exactly as advertised, well ahead of schedule.

The highest amount of power that the system draws is 545.5w, so you really don't need 750w or 850w power supply. The card's temperature is 69-70 after hours of gaming. If you want to overclock the card even further than the manufacturer buy strix or ftw3 instead because the power limit on this card is only 107% (though I personally think oc does not make much difference in gaming). The card is also very quiet even on full load with 80% fan speed. There is not much difference between 10 gb and 12 gb. The only reason that I got 12 gb was that it was on sale for $950, even less than 10 gb.

LolMy last build was over 10 years ago, so imagine the leap I just took.I was grimacing a bit over the price, but for a 12gb vid card, let's go!!She is mated to an Asus X570 wifi. I know, I know, should have gotten a better MB, but I was really only planning on doing the MB, mem and HD that failed. Ended up stuffing a 2TB WD SSD, a 2TB platter and some cool corsair memory. Then I decided to get the video card bcoz my old 970 RTX was throwing my board fault beeps. Anyway, just got it up and running. Loving the quickness. Going to load MSFS 2020 and get back to flying to see how she runs. I'm sure it's going to handle it just fine.More later on after I run bench tests. The windows experience score (which yes you still can do on Windows 10) scored me in the high 9's with the exception of the platter even tho she's a 7200rpm gold WD.Oh well I still like it. Win OS on the platter on a 250gb partition, the master boot record of 100mb the rest wide open.  The ssd is wide open.

This card also runs the most cool of all my past cards. Hanging around the 60C mark under high demand. Plus, this card looks super sexy. The dab of RGB adds a nice touch without the overkill. This card also pulls half the wattage than my previous 2060 did! This 4070 does everything I ask it to and I'm glad I got this instead of the TI version and saved 200 bucks.

Also, this card only needs a single 8-pin power connector, which is great. It's packaged extremely well and comes with it's own GPU stand to prevent sag. The dual BIOS switch is set to quiet right out of the box and indeed, the fans are completely silent on this setting. However, I slid the switch to performance right after trying out the silent operation and I've not heard the fans in this setting either, even after two and three hours of gameplay. This card easily fits in my Corsair 5000d case.My 3070 would get 45fps in MSFS2020 with DLSS set to balanced. I would see 100% GPU usage and 75% CPU. The 3070 would run between 200-230 watts while playing this game and most others. Farcry 6 would see 90 FPS but I couldn't use the HD textures due to only having 8gb of Vram.With this GPU, I've got MSFS2020 set to DLSS with AI Frame Gen enabled. I'm seeing 147fps! I can now land my helicopter on different rooftops in New York city without the 1% lows making for a stuttering landing. The 4070 runs at 80% utilization, CPU down to 50%. I see 155-165W power draw. Farcry 6 now runs in the 130 fps range with HD textures enabled.I didn't need to upgrade my power supply for this GPU as it uses less energy than the 3070 it replaced. So that was a savings. Also, I live in Florida so the 3070 would heat up my office quickly. the lower wattage use translates into less heat put off and a more comfortable room. The extra 4Gb of video Ram is a great upgrade as well.Asus makes some of the very best GPU's on the market and this one in particular has been rated as the best of the 4070 makers by at least two online review sites, and for good reason. Full metal backplate, single 8-pin power connector, silent operation from the three fans and 3080 level performance!"", 'Nvidia has become a criminal enterprise.

One word of caution though is with regards to the upcoming GeForce RTX 3060 8GB; its memory bandwidth is reduced versus the 12GB version so it will likely be cheaper but slower than the 12GB version so the two cards need to have their value calculation done separately.This card is a plain Jane, simple 6650XT.  No RGB, no backplate, but a true 6650XT core with a decent dual fan cooler.  It's also a pretty small card at 200x111x39mm (about 8x4.5x1.5in) so a great option for  those with a small case like an ITX or microATX case.  GPU power consumption is very reasonable as well; stock it's 143w under load and using the Adrenalin driver you can set a -6 to +10% power limit, giving 134w under load at -6 and 157w under load  at +10%.  I've paired it with a Ryzen 7 5800X and running the Cyberpunk 2077 in-game benchmark at High in 1440p gave me ~95fps stock, with the power limit slider at the max and min giving around a 1.5fps gain and loss respectively.The only main flaw of this card is its ray tracing performance.  At 1080p it'll run ray traced shadows with a modest performance hit, but ray traced reflections will significantly lower the framerate likely to the point of not really being playable.  In my mind it's too much of a performance hit considering rasterization can fake reflections pretty well.  At 1440p just keep the ray tracing turned off unless you want to take a screenshot.  I don't think it's worth a one star reduction because its impressive rasterization performance more than offsets this weakness and its main competitor at this performance segment (the GeForce RTX 3060) also struggles with playable raytracing performance, just less so than the 6650XT.So in summary I like this card and would definitely recommend it if it's amongst the cheapest 6650XTs on the market, if you have a small case that would struggle to fit one of the three fan cards or Goliath-sized  two fan designs, and/or if you just need a simple, no frills gaming card that you don't care doesn't do ray tracing particularly well.I've included a picture of it installed in my system to give a reference of size.

They've been nuts for >year, they're going to be nuts for at least another year or more. It won't magically get better next week and let you finally score that $799 3080.(1) Yep, sure, this is a very expensive card at $1799 MSRP, $1899 actual as of Nov 2021. It's a bad value for money compared to the 3080! Prices are crazy! etc etc. Look,  I don't build my PC to get 'value for money' - I'm not shopping for a used Toyota Corolla.(2)  You can actually buy this card, now, from a first party seller (amazon shipped/sold), without spending every waking moment of your life monitoring a stock tracker (and still not getting anything). Amazon opens up pre-orders every few days, and keeps them open for hours. Anyone can buy this card, no camping at best buy required, no shady ebay sellers sending you a brick in a box.(3) It has the lowest markup over MSRP of anything out there (~$100).(4) It's extremely, extremely fast - my Timespy scores are significantly higher than the 3080ti average, no OC. The reviews out there showing this slower than the FE are either wrong, or a fluke (or I won the silicon lottery).(5) Temps are excellent - 72C max in FurMark default settings.(5) The build quality is good. The shroud is a nice matte finish. I don't like RGB normally but the LEDs are actually nice and the default color is a soft blue/green.Other stuff:- I upgraded from an 8 year old GTX 670!- I ordered it on Saturday and received it on Wednesday- don't let the lack of shipping date scare you.- Zotac offers a 3 year warranty if you register your product- Noise is fine. Obviously loud when running, say, Control at max settings, but everyone wears headphones these days anyway. I will play with the fan curves & under volting later.- Card is an excellent candidate for de-shrouding w/Noctua fans. Several folks have done this already.This fits great in my Ncase M1 if I remove the front I/O panel. No 180 power adapters required. I don't use the front ports, so it's not a big deal. I'm relocated the power button to the rear of the case, using one of the un-used circular cut outs."", 'I bought this Amp Holo card after getting the XFX RX 6900 XT Merc 319 Limited Black for my other system I\'m building. I read good reviews about it from the old-school, reputable online PC websites. It\'s faster than the Radeon, which is a beast on its own with its binned XTXH chip.Both on benchmarks and during games at 4K, even with the AMD Smart Access Memory advantage when paired with my Ryzen 9 3900X and 5950X  and enabled on the BIOS and driver, the Amp Holo pulls away.Sadly, I did have to return it to Amazon due to it idling at 60-65 degrees straight out of the box, which is not normal at all. The stock fan curve is too lenient. They start ramping up when the card is crazy hot already.It ended up running at 75-80 degrees on full blast. That\'s right on the limit before it starts throttling. It\'s obvious someone did something wrong with the thermal pads when assembling it at the factory.It heats up my room like a sauna and smells very hot. With those three fans, it should run cooler. They also howl like an airliner. A card running that hot will have an early death.Is it worth over $1800 with tax? Given the current crazy GPU market, performance-wise, YES. It runs games at 4K60 like nothing. It boosts to 1980 MHz out of the box with just the driver and no other app. \u200bBuild quality-wise? No way. It\'s constructed so cheaply. So plasticky and fragile-feeling. The RGB lights also look cheap.Very low resolution. Even my four year-old EVGA GTX 1080 SC looks and feels twice as expensive as the Amp Holo.All in all, I lost confidence in Zotac after this first experience with their product.Thankfully, I found an Aorus RTX 3080 Ti XTREME 12G on an online website that has egg in its name. It\'s the top of the line card, faster, yet its ""MSRP"" was $150 cheaper at $1649.99.Not only does it look and feel better and has more features, it idles in the low 40s and hits 65-75 degrees during benchmarks and gaming.This is with my PC room always being at a tropical 80-95 degrees F throughout the day.I assume my Amp Holo card was put together in a hurry. I understand the times and the market, but at $1799.99 ""MSRP"", it\'s unacceptable to put out a product that isn\'t working like it should and also has such low quality materials, and fit and finish.I buy things to keep them.  I deeply research them and decide I\'m willing to pay the price. It\'s a firm decision. I don\'t enjoy wasting time having to return them due to manufacturing defects.

I honestly hope that you\'re reading this review at a time when cards like this are readily available because if so you should buy one and if not, I\'m sorry. I got lucky.It\'s December 2021 and I was lucky enough to buy this card 4 months ago with Amazon\'s monthly payment option. It\'s going to be paid off next month. And yes, it cost me almost $2,000, but when you consider that it was hard to find cards slower than this one at all and scalpers were selling things like the regular 3070 at twice this price, I thought I got a really good deal.I bought this card to play a few games at their highest settings: MS Flight Simulator (2020), Cyberpunk 2077, Deathloop and Half-Life: Alyx (VR), but also to pretty much add any games that came along and not have to worry about the video settings. I was really getting tired of playing that ""will this setting work?"" game with my old 1060ti on every game I ever tried to play.Anyway, flying from my home city of Pittsburgh to Chicago\'s Meigs field in MS FS 2000 with everything maxed was just beautiful -- the CLOUDS! Cyberpunk with ray-tracing on (the neon reflections are so great!) with no frame loss... Deathloop is an amazing game with beautiful visuals and maxing out the frame rate makes the occasional PvP so effective.I do a lot of VR with my Oculus Quest 2 and I couldn\'t even consider doing Oculus Air Link with my old GPU for most games, but it just rocks with Half-Life: Alyx now! Side note: It\'s really the best VR game I\'ve ever experienced.Summary: great card, hard to find - but get it if you can.

I wanted a 3080, but settled on this 3080 TI at a much higher price and although pricey, it has not disappointed me at all.So far this beast of a GPU can handle all of my games at 3440 x 1440p 21: 9 ultra wide with all setting on max. I know you will say, as it should at this price point which is true. However, many people did not like the Zotac brand and I can now confirm it is a very solid brand. The cooling on this is amazing so far. The highest I have seen it go is 70c after hours of gaming. I tried it on the new Amazon game called New World recently and it only gets to 69c after hours on there. So the cooling is great and not too loud at all. I cannot hear the GPU over the case fans.The RGB on this GPU is also very impressive, you can select any color and all kinds of sliding and moving effects that go across the side and top metal back plate. Very high build quality on this card.Although the price is higher on the 3080 TI compared to the 3080, the power is also 10-15% higher as well in games.

The software behind the GPU is a little lacking (GPU LED management was buggy at first), and the installation guide was lacking (nowhere does it say you need 2 different PCI/GPU cables in the box, I had to research). Not big issues since I do not need to mess with the card (overclocking, fan curves, etc).These are things I'd expect to be better at this MSRP $1.8k pricepoint. MSRP for the 3080TI is $1300 or so, Zotac lists this at $1,800 MSRP.

The only thing really lacking lately was my GTX 960. It would not run a game like GTAV well at all anymore.My single fan EVGA GTX 960 SC would get very choppy and the fan would ramp up to 100% and be pretty noisy. A quick note on the 960 is most of the time during normal/non-game use, the fan does not spin at all and GPU temp would sit around 60C. The fan would not turn on until 80C. That's all fine and normal, but that GPU was just not cutting it anymore, so I figured it was time for a final upgrade for my aging 7th gen Z270 machine.Ordered up this single fan RTX 2060 SC Gaming. It blows the 960 SC out of the water obviously. The 2060 fan seems to always run at 33%/1000 RPM during normal use. I loaded up EVGA's Precision X1 and the fan speed cannot be set below 33%. But that's OK. I honestly can't even hear it. Under heavier use/gaming, the fan definitely spins up higher, but it's very much less noticeable than the 960. As I'm sitting here writing this review, the GPU temp is at 33C, fan is at 1k RPM and is basically silent. Just ran GTAV for a couple of hours. It was buttery smooth. GPU temp was running around 60-65C and fan hit maybe 2k RPM. Could barely hear it. Not bad at all. I run an LG ultrawide display and it handles 2560x1080@60Hz very well.One final note. I always found this annoying about my GTX 960. I have my TV connected to the HDMI port and my normal monitor on the DisplayPort. The 960's HDMI port is primary. So my TV had to be on if I wanted to see POST messages. This RTX 2060 is the opposite. The DP is primary. Yes, the single fan 2060 does take up 3 slots, and the 960 only took two, but I'm not running any other PCIe cards, so it really doesn't matter.I don't think I could be much happier with this upgrade. I can highly recommend this 2060 series as a low cost option for a GPU upgrade to anyone else with a similar system before going all out on an entire system upgrade."", 'UPDATEDate Written: 11/18/2022Rating: 5/5★Price★With the GPU often going on sale for $280, I\'d have to argue now that it\'s a great deal for budget build PCs. I gave this thought, reconsidering GPU prices of the RTX 3060, 3070, both their variants. I\'ve also been watching market prices closely for the past year. EVGA sales are more frequent so you\'re not going to be waiting long if they\'re not on sale. The RTX 3060 12GB is normally about $450, and it isn\'t that much faster than the RTX 2060. The RTX 2060 6GB is about $350 but goes on sale often. Would you pay $75-100 extra for 10% performance increase and 6gb of additional ram? Personally, I don\'t see it as a problem unless I wanted to play at 1440p, 2k, 4k resolutions.★Performance★This is an important note to anyone getting this GPU. Do not use fan coolers. Get liquid cooling, a bigger PC case with fans, and you\'ll be surprised at how cool this GPU runs. I\'ve been able to max out my settings all because I kept my CPU from heating up my PC. Without a doubt, if you had a small PC case using a stock cooler, you\'d experience what I did in my last review. It made a huge difference in performance. Because there\'s no thermal throttling, I\'ve been able to play every game with max settings at 60FPS at 1080p. Highest quality DXR does somewhat take a hit, mostly due to the lack of VRAM. Easily, this is a worthwhile GPU for budget PCs. I should note that you shouldn\'t try to overclock this card as there\'s no voltage control.★Problems★This section isn\'t to remark on issues, but to explain how you should have your PC case optimally set up when using higher-end GPUs. If you\'re still using a fan cooler, I recommend what I suggested above and purchase a bigger PC case with fans along with liquid cooling. It will go a long way, not just for your GPU, but for every component in your PC. It will drop all temps dramatically, keeping it all alive longer. I wouldn\'t be surprised if fan coolers were the primary cause of suddenly dead GPUs. The RTX 2060 6GB rarely hits temps of 50-60. Will be updating review to show benchmarks.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ORIGINALDate Written: 7/13/2022Rating: 2/5★Price★At the time of purchase, RTX GPUs were overpriced, often $100s over MSRP. I was able to get mine for $280 brand new which seemed like a good deal, especially when the RTX 3050 performs worse than the RTX 2060. Now that GPU prices are closing in on their MSRPs, buying the RTX 2060 KO Ultra was more of a loss. I can confidently say that the RTX 20 Series is no longer worth the money, and you should be looking into a RTX 30 Series instead. I won\'t even recommend getting the RTX 2060 12GB as you can find the RTX 3060 OC 12gb that costs a little more, if not nearly the same price. Of course, avoid the RTX 3050 as well.★Performance★If you\'re buying this GPU because it uses a binned RTX 2070/2080 die, you should know that it doesn\'t offer better in-game performance than its predecessor. With DLSS/FidelityFX enabled, it runs at 60fps 1080p with raytracing settings on high. However, there is an obvious loss of quality when upscaling 720p and below to 1080p. When upscaling is disabled, it runs at 30-45fps on average. For that, I can\'t recommend this as an ""entry-level DXR capable GPU"". For non-DXR gaming, it can easily achieve 60fps at 1080p/1440p resolution. While it\'s a fair and considerable upgrade from a GTX, I would much rather have a RTX that can handle raytracing without upscaling.★Problems★Because of its two-slot design, the heatsink doesn\'t disperse as much heat as its three-slot predecessor, and so it heats up more. Without a doubt, it would struggle to stay cool in PC cases with poor airflow or were too small. The GPU\'s fan curve seems to max at 85%, so you will need EVGA Precision or MSI Afterburner to allow 100% fan speed. As a warning, it will get MUCH louder. The GPU\'s power limit is clamped, so you can\'t safely overclock the GPU very much, if at all. The RTX 2060 Founders Edition can be overclocked to perform better than the KO Ultra. Not that I\'m recommending the Founders Edition variant, I still believe you should look for a RTX 30 series GPU, except the RTX 3050.', 'EDIT: This review took three days to post and my opinion has changed since I originally wrote this.  I have noted my edits below.Summary: This review is for the EVGA GeForce RTX 2060 XC Gaming (06G-P4-2063-KR).  It’s shorter than the dual fan minis from Zotac.  It’s longer than the single fan half-length minis from Gigabyte and MSI.  It’s taller than most other cards and uses three case slots. I’m not sure if the larger design is beneficial.  EVGA has opted for three outputs with a DVI-D while the other minis have four outputs with three DPs and an HDMI.EDIT: Noise levels at factory settings are good under moderate and variable loads but mediocre under constant maximum load.  This card is much quieter when undervolted but results may not be consistent.  The card I received has severe coil whine.Design and Size (3/5): I respect EVGA for the logic of this card’s design.  Most people buy a half-length card for being cheaper and tolerate the lower performance from a single fan cooler.  The people who buy a half-length card for its length usually plan to stick the card into a prebuilt with only eight inches of clearance.  Why not make a card that has great performance and fits most cases but also doesn’t cost extra?  The result is a brick-shaped cooler with copper pipes and a copper plate.  However, it’s not readily clear if this design outperforms a normal half-length design.This design also has quite a few drawbacks.  The largest drawback is the three slot design which is a problem for anyone who uses other PCI devices.  If your PCI slots are low in the case then the intake fan won’t have any clearance.  If you own a case that only has two expansion slots then this card is a non-starter since it uses three slots.  If you actually do have a case that can only take a half-length card then this card is also a non-starter.EDIT: The open air cooler is also side vented.  This card will bake itself in slim cases with metal side panels.  Make sure that your case has exhaust clearance.  This card also does not have a fan idle mode.Compatibility (N/A):  This card should work in most prebuilts.  I tested this card in a Dell Optiplex 7010 (Ivy Bridge 2012).  It even works with survivable temperatures (85C and 90% fan usage) in cases with almost no ventilation.  This is a solid upgrade for prebuilts with an extra 8-pin connector.EDIT: Make sure the prebuilt case has clearance for the side vented exhaust.Power and Temperatures (5/5): This card is equal to the multi-fan designs that have been reviewed. It never gets close to thermal throttling.EDIT:  Rating +1. The factory overclock does work.  The aggressive clock boost made it really hard to evaluate if the overclock was functional.  The card will even boost above the factory overclock in some cases.  Heat and noise levels rise badly when it does though.Noise Levels (2/5*): The fan has a clean hum but does get noisy under load.  In relative terms, the noise level is decent for a single fan card. In absolute terms, the noise level does get annoying if you have a quieter case or environment.I found that 60-70% fan usage was the threshold for “annoying.”  When you reach this point depends on your system cooling.  In my case, the noise level was fine when the card was under moderate load (50-70%) with periodic load spikes.  However, when the card was under constant maximum load, the fan was unable to control heat while also being quiet.The card I received also had severe coil whine.  EVGA does regard severe coil whine as a defect and is willing to replace a card that has it.EDIT: Rating +3 (only with undervolt).  I was able to reduce the overall heat and power usage by reducing voltages and limiting the maximum frequency.  I was then able to reduce the fan usage from 70% to 50%.  The final result was a card that is both quiet and cold.The problem is that ""undervolting"" is tedious to stability test.  There\'s an extra level of technical knowledge required to set up a VF curve in Afterburner or Precision.  Results also may not be consistent.  Other cards may require more voltage to run stable.  The out-of-box noise levels for this card are still bad.  I wouldn\'t advise this card without a decent undervolt.I\'m using a VF curve that mostly limits the card to its factory overclock of 1755 MHz @ 0.8V, down from 0.9V.  Memory is 7500 MHz, up from 7000 MHz.  The fan curve is 33-50% from 0-75C and 50-70% from 75C-100C.These are fairly conservative settings.  I think there is overhead for an overclock with the undervolt, but I was trying to lower fan usage below the threshold that I found bothersome.The severity of the coil whine was much greater than I originally thought.  When I spoke with EVGA, they said it was a defect and offered upfront to authorize an advanced RMA.  They\'ll send me a new card first and then I\'ll send this card back.  They\'ll pay for shipping both directions.This response is excellent.  However, I\'d rather not play the coil whine lottery.  I don\'t know if the problem is the card or the card series.Display Outputs (4/5): I’m not sold on DVI-D in 2019, but for people who still need this output, EVGA has the only mini card on the US market with one.  I prefer the other minis with four outputs.  It also doesn’t have USB-C, but most cards don’t have this output, so EVGA doesn’t lose any points for this.Aesthetics (3/5): There’s no backplate which is a cheap move for a card of this price.  The minis from Zotac and MSI have backplates.  The color scheme is black and grey with no lighting.  There’s no green aside from the “XC” text on the side.Final Score (3.5/5*).  This loses the most rating for having coil whine and loud fan with the factory settings.  Having no backplate is a stingy exclusion.  I dislike the output selection.  It’s highly dubious to exchange two DisplayPorts for one DVI-D.  Adapters aren’t rare or expensive.  It’s also ironic that I can’t use this card with the EVGA Nu Audio sound card.  This card is too large for both of them to fit.EDIT: Rating +0.5 or more (only with undervolt).  My opinion of this card has improved after undervolting.  This card\'s noise level still kind of sucks out of the box.  I\'m not entirely sold on design choices and I\'m slightly concerned about the coil whine.  I\'m not sure if I\'ll accept the RMA offer, and I still might return this pending reviews for the half-length cards from Gigabyte and MSI.', 'Bon produit et conforme', ""I built a system in 202 with a Ryzen 5 3600 but pirated my old 1060 because I was short on cash.

Can't say how long this system will be viable for, and if I could have afforded better I might have, but as of August 2023 I can play anything I want to; some newer titles I have to tweak graphics down just a tick, but it runs the newer Assassin's Creed games (Odyssey, Origins, Valhalla) and Overwatch 2 at 60 FPS and looks great doing it.

Une carte souvent décrié par certains youtuber mais qui pourtant aujourd'hui est juste le meilleur rapport qualité prix ! Le 1080P60 en ultra sur tous les jeux, le 1440P60 ultra idem, ça tourne super bien, pour ma part je bride à 60FPS max du fait que mon moniteur est uniquement 1080P60 donc inutile qu'elle aille au dessus ... en résulte des températures contenu entre 55°C à 60°C max.

Son poids laisse supposer une construction ""légère"" mais ce n\'est pas du tout le cas. Le plastique est de bonne qualité et la backplate très sobre et stylée à la fois. Le système de refroidissement est correctement dimensionné avec un caloduc et un radiateur de belle épaisseur et de belle taille mais malheureusement de 3 petits ventilos de 8 cm. Et là est le problème, les 3 petits ventilos doivent tourner à une certaine vitesse quand ils sont sollicités, on est aux alentours des 3200 trs/min, autant dire que dans une tour orientée silence c\'est très audible, la turbine se met en route. Si je peux vous conseiller le modèle avec les 2 ventilos de 10 cm allez-y, ils seront surement moins bruyants.Si on met de coté ce coté turbine on ne peut nier que le refroidissement est excellent avec des températures de jonction qui dépassent rarement les 64° et les 54° sur les bords du GPU. Le fait est que le meilleur compromis est encore de changer le fonctionnement par défaut via le soft AMD en le passant en ""équilibré"". Dès lors les ventilos se font moins entendre et les t° montent aux alentours de 75°. encore soutenables pour la pérennité des composants.Sur un AC Valhalla en ultra on est régulièrement au delà des 80fps avec des pics avoisinant les 100 fps, par moment, sur un GOW très gourmand on tourne aux alentours des 70 fps, toujours en ultra. des perfs très honorables à mon gout.Pour ceux qui souhaitent profiter des 144hz de leur nouvel écran soit on réduira certains paramètres soit on devra taper 2 ou 3 gammes au dessus avec un prix à l\'avenant.Globalement, c\'est une très  bonne carte d\'un point de vue purement perf/prix, par contre la ventilation méritait un peu plus de soin.', ""GPU très puissante, mais si vous voulez utiliser le Ray Tracing... en 720p oui (ou bien 1080p avec FSR), sinon oubliez. J'ai overclock pour voir le max de performance sur cette carte et j'ai pu faire:Clock frequency: 2900\xa0MhzMem: 2200\xa0mhzEn allant plus haut j'ai eu la correction de mémoire et donc les performances étaient les mêmes ou pire qu'avant (voila pourquoi il faut tester à chaque fois que vous augmentez).Pour le bruit, oui, il s'entend assez quand vous utilisez la carte au max. Personnellement, je m'en fiche un peu mais voilà, pour certains ça peut être un problème.En parlant de l'utilisation au max, voici quelques infos sur les FPS (IPS, Images par seconde) en 1080\xa0p:Apex Legends (Qualites Max): 144+ la plupart du temps (entre 120 - 180)CoD Warzone (Qualites Max): 130 (100 - 150)Valorant (Max evidemment lol) : 300+ (dépends de votre CPU)RDR2 (Max avec un peu de settings en high): vous aurez une expérience 60fpsCyberpunk je ne sais plus mais tout en ultra 60+ fps garantie (j'ai jamais eu du lag dans ce jeu)Ce produit est très bien pour mes besoins mais si je pouvais aller dans le passé, j'aurais plutôt pris une 6700 XT qui coute plus au moins 500.PS: les benchmarks ne sont pas 100% fiables, je joue toujours avec l'overlay AMD dans le coin de l'écran et donc à force de voir les Fps à chaque fois, je sais plus au moins les Fps dans chaque jeu mdr."", ""Admittedly I haven't yet put this card through its paces with modern games, but I have played some old favourites at 144fps 1080p. It runs the games I've played like an absolute dream. Definitely a huge upgrade from a GTX 960, that's for sure.As for temperatures it idles at about 40c with the fans off, and in the most demanding games I've played it can reach 80c with the fans only at 40%. It's almost completely silent at this point or at least I can't hear the card over the sound of my CPU fan. And if you're worried about the temperatures you can always set a more aggressive fan curve.Keep in mind these temps are during the current heatwave in the UK, so they will be lower for most of the year."", 'Premettendo che non gioco agli fps eccetto warframe, questa scheda video scalda molto meno di una rtx 3060 e ha performance leggermente migliori. Perde contro una rtx 3060Ti, ma sul prezzo, la RX, le batte tutte e due.Accoppiato a un Ryzen 5 3600 regge tranquillamente il preset ""insano"" di Ashes of the Singularity.Il profilo in metallo che la aiuta a mantenersi dritta sul socket PCI-E fa il suo lavoro, ho comunque inserito il sostegno per scrupolo poiché in effetti è pesantuccia.A meno che non la utilizzate per giochi come cyberpunk o simili a grafica ultra, difficilmente le sue ventole andranno sparate al massimo.Grazie a msi si può impostare il profilo silenzioso che azzera la ventola e permette un discreto raffreddamento passivo per i giochi più leggeri o le attività desktop.Al 15%, il minimo consentito, la ventola è praticamente impercettibile. Se usate un M.2 nello slot superiore al socket PCI-E, consiglio di tenere la ventola accesa comunque al minimo, poiché è probabile che la scheda madre condivida lo slot e quindi alzi drasticamente le temperature dell\'SSD.Alla vendita il suo prezzo era identico alla versione con solo due ventole (400€) e a parer mio è stato un affare. A meno che non viviate in montagna (che è meglio) in città le temperature sono terribili durante l\'estate e la Speedster QICK308 ha sicuramente un vantaggio notevole sul raffreddamento.Dopo averla posseduta per circa un mese, l\'unica pecca che ho trovato è forse un occasionale, ma debole coil whine. Durante carichi pesanti però, le ventole fanno sicuramente molto più rumore. Quindi niente di che.', ""I'll preface this by saying the card I purchased was from Amazon directly, at the partner's (XFX) MSRP, which is sadly a bit higher than AMD's MSRP. With that said, for what it is, it's a fantastic 1080p gaming card. I'm coming from a nVidia GTX 970 (ASUS Strix) that has seen many more years of use than I originally planned. My 970 was showing it's age not only in capability, but how the usage over time had worn it out, and I was concerned with it failing on me before securing a replacement.I use this card in a dual-os environment with Windows 10 and Arch Linux (BTW), and other than having to delete my Xorg.conf file generated by the nVidia software, it has been a smooth ride on both systems. Many games that I normally play can now run on Ultra at 60fps, 1080p. I haven't had a lot of time do play many games yet, but the difference between the two cards is staggering. The raytracing leaves more to be desired, but that was never a requirement for me, and I was aware of this prior to purchase.I have played Fallout 4 and 76, Minecraft Bedrock and Java, and some Celeste, all ran well in Windows. Minecraft and Celeste in Linux also ran great, Fallout 76 had really bad graphical issues, but that is likely my fault, as I am certain that I messed up my Wine/Proton configs globally. I attempted the Time Theif 3D Mark Benchmark on both cards, but the software fails to do the final two tests with the 6600xt. I am uncertain if this is 3D Mark or the card, but this happened when I upgraded from my 760 to my 970 in the past, so take that with a grain of salt.Lastly, I have this paired with an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 and 32GB of DDR4 clocked at 3200MHz, and a Samsung EVO 970 NVMe SSD. The combination has proved to be very stable and beneficial (no overclocking), and I have seen some decreases in load times on the Fallout games.If you are in a bind for a card, or looking to get into PC gaming, this card does well. Sadly, with the current market, this is the best option I could find for my use that wasn't buying from a scalper. This card seems to be frequently in-stock as well."", 'Realmente me ha encantado está tarjeta gráfica. En primer lugar el envío fue muy rápido y eficiente; el precio se podría decir que es ""justo"" comparándolo con la situación actual. Todos los vídeojuegos hasta el momento men han corrido a más de 100 fps a 1080. La refrigeración de esta tarjeta es uno de sus puntos fuertes puesto que juegos como halo infinite o warzone no llegan a superar los 80 °c. En conclusión una excelente gráfica para actualizar tu set up. Le doy 4 estrellas por su precio que se aleja unos 120 euros desde su salida aprox', ""I bought this to replace an older RX 560 that was still holding its own, but was pushed to the limits by even 4 - 5-year-old AAA games. This one is still considered entry-level, but it's a step up and will keep me going for a couple of years. It wasn't the big leap I wanted to make, but I couldn't justify spending $900+ for the 6700. I figured I had better grab what I could now before prices push even higher, thanks to chip shortages, supply-chain disruptions, scalpers and crypto-miners.The card is a definite improvement. It runs very quietly and gives a smoother experience at higher frame rates than my old card. I haven't tried overclocking it, but will cross that bridge when I come to it. I love Fallout 4 (no, it's NOT a brand new title, but good for comparison). I was getting ~35 fps on the 560 with high settings. With the 6600xt, I'm getting 55+ fps on ultra settings. Good so far, but not great.This brings me to two downsides: Connections and price. The Amazon listing states that this card has two HDMI ports. It doesn't. It has three display port connections and one HDMI. That would be great if I owned a monitor or TV that used display port, but I only have HDMI. Now I have to buy a new monitor or wait for an adapter to arrive so I can use my dual-monitor setup for work. Not helpful when most monitors I'm seeing online use HDMI. Then there's price. What can I say except that I feel ripped off when an entry-level graphics card is so insanely overpriced that I could gut and rebuild the rest of my computer for just a little more. At $650, this was the cheapest upgrade I could find. The next level would have been $900+ and beyond that would have been over $1,200.Anyway, I would recommend this adapter to anyone looking for something to tide them over in hopes of better prices down the road. It's good but not incredible."", ""Con la spedizione express è arrivata in soli 2 giorni.Venditore super affidabile, trall'altro ufficiale del brand XFX.La scheda video è arrivata ben imballata.Ho avuto problemi nella montatura poiché la mascherina delle porte era troppo lunga per il mio case, ma mi è bastato smontarla e piegare le alette con una morsa (circa 10 minuti di lavoro).Dopo aver fatto un po' di benchmark, posso garantirvi che per il Full HD basta e avanza.Non esiste alcun titolo in cui va sotto i 60FPS a dettagli alti o ultra.A pieno regime, con le impostazioni stock, è arrivata a toccare MASSIMO 72°C.Tutto questo con un Ryzen 5600x e 16 GB di RAM.Ero un po' scettico del brand XFX, non viene recensito molto bene a giro per il web, ma posso assicurarvi che la mia esperienza è stata alquanto soddisfacente."", 'Placa perfeita, fria e fica bem fica no gabinete ( tinha dúvida por ela ser grande) nada a reclamar.']"

Schon die GT 730 mit DDR5 VRAM hat zwar einen höheren Speichertakt, dafür aber auch einen Quirl, frißt zwei ganze Stecksockel und tut sich ordentlich Leistung rein.Die Zotac GeForce GT 730 Zone schneidet in den einschlägigen Benchmarks ganz ordentlich ab und treibt sogar OpenGL 4.5 nebst GLSL 4.60 und Direct3D 11, das konnte ein Test mit dem Ozone GPU Caps Viewer eindeutig bestätigen.Für diejenigen, die 3D im WWW machen, hier allerdings eine Warnung: Selbst mit den neuesten NVidia-Treibern (417.71) funktioniert trotz größter Anstrengungen WebGL 2.0 NICHT(!) in meinem aktuellen Chrome Browser. Webglreport.com liefert ""This browser supports WebGL 2, but it is disabled or unavailable."", aus Unity 3D exportierte WebGL-2.0-Projekte laden nicht. Da gibt es eine ""Warning: Unsupported graphics API WebGL 2.0"" und schließlich: ""Could not initialize WebGL context. Failed starting Unity."".In den einschlägigen Foren war zu vernehmen, daß vom Treiber das Feature GL_ARB_ES3_compatibility unterstützt werden muß und mindestens OpenGL 3.3 verfügbar, das ist aber lt. Ozone GPU Caps Viewer der Fall. Im NVidia-Entwicklerforum heißt es ""You will need any one of the following Fermi, Kepler, Maxwell or Pascal based GPUs"", die GT 730 ist Kepler, wovon man sich mit geringem Aufwand überzeugen kann.Der schon länger etablierte Standard WebGL 1.0 funktioniert.Zurück bleibt ein etwas zwiespältiges Bild, die Karte ist relativ kompakt, macht auch im Videoschnitt (wo üblicherweise CUDA gefordert wird) eine einigermaßen gute Figur, bleibt auch bei etwas grafikintensiveren Applikation erfreulich kühl und generiert keinen Audiosmog im Arbeitszimmer. Zudem kann man bis zu drei Monitore mit hoher Auflösung gleichzeitig anschließen, via HDMI, DVI und VGA - das muß man in diesem Preissegment auch erstmal finden. Mit WebGL 2.0 ist leider Essig und für wenig mehr Kohle bekommt man schon den GTX-1050-TI-Chipsatz, der möglicherweise auch im PCIe 2.0 x16 Slot meines antiken ASUS P7P55D funktioniert.Im Endergebnis ein Stern Punktabzug, allein schon deshalb, weil nirgendwo (nicht einmal in den technischen Daten auf der Herstellerwebsite)  das WebGL-2.0-Problem thematisiert wird.Nachtrag vom 4.3.2019:Auf das Problem angesprochen reagierte der Zotac-Kundendienst ausgesprochen schnell und freundlich. Man hat meine E-Mail aufmerksam gelesen und den Hinweis gegeben, ich möge es doch bitte statt mit Google Chrome mit einer neuen Version des Firefox-Browsers versuchen. Leider spielen dort nur die sehr grundlegenden WebGL 2.0 Samples von webglsamples.org und die ""After the Flood"" WebGL 2.0 Demo, aus Unity exportiertes Material wirft ""WARNING: Shader Unsupported""-Warnungen und scheitert dann.Dann bin ich dem Tip nachgegangen, Chrome mit dem Parameter --use-angle=gl zu starten, das führte zu einem Treiber-Crash:  Windows event log: ""Display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered."" (Event-ID: 4101).Auch --use-gl=desktop habe ich versucht und in chrome://flags ""Override software rendering list/#ignore-gpu-blacklist"" aktiviert - erfolglos.Seitens des Zotac-Supports riet man mir, es mit älteren Treibern (oder Windows 10) zu versuchen, Zitat: ""Treiber werden von Nvidia entwickelt, Low-End-Grafikkarten und speziell Windows 7 stehen da eher hinten. Wir gehen davon aus, daß eine GT 1030 auf einem ASUS P7P55D nicht funktioniert."".

Absolutely unbeatable bargain at the moment with graphics cards shortages. I paid $780.Performs well at 1440p, although you shouldn't rely on it to get stable over 100 FPS on ultra at that resolution.The ray tracing option in cyberpunk 2077 was not usable. I have not yet tried ray tracing in other games.Coil whine is noticeable at very high FPS. I'd say it starts around 100 and is pretty crazy at 200. Your mileage may vary, depends how quiet your PC is and how close it is to your ears.Cooling is truly excellent. The fans themselves are also very quiet.The card is a bit needlessly long at 323 mm. The last 5mm or so are from a slanted decorative end. This made it difficult to fit into my Q58 case which has a stated clearance of 320 mm. However, because the full length of the card is only true at one Edge of it, I was able to push it in there and once it's in it's quite nice aesthetically, filling the entire width of the case.If I had a bit more money and a larger case I wouldn't hesitate to get the XFX 6900 XT of the same series because I think this is a good card."", 'Ich habe diese Version der 6700XT nun Schon fast ein halbes Jahr und bin voll und Ganz zufrieden mit der Leistung. Die Karte Schafft 1440p mit Hohen Einstellungen bzw Hohe Bildraten wenn man die Grafik in neuen Titeln heruntersetzt.Der verbaute Kühler ist Super und hält meine Karte bei 40-50 Celsius beim Spielen, und 25-35 Idle.Driver Probleme hatte ich bisher auch noch nicht, AMD Driver sind natürlich nicht so ausgereift wie die Nvidia Driver hatte allerdings in 99% der getesten titlen keine Crashes oder Performance einbußungen die von den Drivern außgingen die das Spiel unspielbar gemacht haben.Ich kann diese Grafikkarte nur Empfehlen grade im Preisleistungsverhältnis mit der 3070 die im Europäischen Markt ja noch deutlich teurer ist und nochmal deutlich teurer als Ich diese Karte im Mai 2022 gekauft habe.', ""I did a lot of research on benchmarks for the versions of the RX 6700 xt as the value seems to be the best on the entire GPU market. Going up to a rx 6800 almost doubles the price sometimes..Most of the OC versions are extremely similar in performance, probably because of the 12GB of VRAM. After using this GPU in AAA games, the temps never exceeded 60 Celsius, and stays very quiet all the time. When fan speeds are around 60% I think around 3000rpm, they start to get a bit noisy, but I had to set them at 60% to hear it, no game made the fans ramp up that much!This GPU (auto) sets Ultra setting in every game that I've tried it in, and it runs everything easily and quietly! This card performs better than an rtx 3070 and about the same as an rtx 3080; maybe slightly less fps than the 3080, but they're very close and comparable!BTW this card is HUGE, I think it is 323 millimeters long. So make sure it fits your case! I had to move a fan out of the front of my case just to fit it into a mid-tower atx.. But it has a cool design and looks great in the build! Very happy with the performance and price! This was a great deal!"", ""So with GPU Prices being what they are, I've been watching for a 6700 XT for a while.  This guy hit $621 from Amazon and, after using the gift cards I had, only cost me $280 out of pocket.So no, performance: compared to the RX590 it is leaps and bounds better.  I am running 1440P, 10bpc 4:4:4 YCbCr, 120Hz on my LG 49NANO85.  If you are curious, yes I can get the same at 4K.  In CyberPunk 2077 - 1440 Ultra/High - FSR Auto - I am getting 90-100FPS.  I also play GW2 and get 75-150 (depending on zone) normally, but sadly still 25-30 in major zerg fests...that is just normal for GW2 sadly.Heat is low, haven't seen it top 65C yet even when only using 45% (which is virtually silent) on my fan curve with MSI Afterburner.  My RX590 would hit 70-75 in just a few minutes and was louder at 55-60% than 6x 140mm + 1x 120mm fan at 75% speed combined.  So noise is no issue.Honestly I would have loved another ASRock but I have used XFX in the past and like the design.  Sadly I could not vertically mount it in my Cooler Master M500P case because my Hyper 212 is in the way.  But even so, I am very happy with the card."", ""GPU pagata il doppio del listino ma acquisto obbligato dato che ci lavoro. Poco male quindi spendere 1K anziché 500€. Il rapporto qualità/prezzo comunque è praticamente inesistente, senza che il venditore ne abbia più di tanta colpa voglio dire.Per il resto la scheda mastera il FHD e si presta ai 60 FPS anche su 4K. Non li raggiunge mai stabilmente ma oscilla fra i 55 ed i 60. Il consumo elettrico è ridicolo (100W) a fronte di prestazioni superlative. In OC tirato le performance non migliorano più di 2-3 FPS mentre il consumo elettrico tocca i 150W, cosa che lo rende poco sensato IMHO.Il design è total black con una scritta disegnata nella parte sotto, che a scheda montata diventa sopra. Personalmente apprezzo sempre il total black piuttosto che componenti pieni di luci led quindi ottimo stile anche se molto basic.Felicissimo dell'acquisto quindi, salvo:- Il prezzo che è doppio del listino- Il fatto che 4 dentelli del dissipatore fossero piegati come se la scheda fosse caduta senza imballo"", ""I bought this card likely at the peak of the silly (mining) season, needless to say I paid with an organ, jokes aside, it was SIGNIFICANTLY overpriced when I bought it, but I don't have buyers remorse because I knew what I was doing. I wanted the best bang for the considerably stupid buck and this was it at the time. Was it worth what I paid for it? resoundingly NO, was it what made sense at the time? yes. It works well, stable, and I play all my games at 1440p without issues. Wish it had RGB, but that would have costed my the next kidney and I need that more (j/k)."", ""The AMD Radeon RX 6700xt is very cheap in comparison to Nvidia and enough for most games at high quality settings, with at least 60 fps QHD gaming. For maxed settings and more frames you need a better graphics card. If u want good raytracing u need to buy a Nvidia card, AMD has not enough power to make a good raytracing experience.

This video card works like a charm.', ""First off, this is not a gaming card by any stretch of the imagination so lets get that out of the way. I havent used it for any gaming and have no intention of doing so; I installed it in my workstation as a display output and thats it. It works amazing with hardware accelerated applications and video playback but other than that, I dont use it for anything graphically intensive.This GPU fall into a weird category where it has current hardware, like GDDR5 & PCIe 2.0, but under that heatsink it is still the tried and true GT730 Kepler 2.0 core. This presents some interesting issues with driver support as technically Kepler is EOL.After some messing around with drivers, I found that its the standalone nvidia installer itself that seems to have an issue with the GPU. The easiest work around I found was to download a legacy version of Nvidia Geforce Experience application, because the most recent release will tell you that you're using an unsupported card. Once you have the legacy version of Geforce Experience installed, follow the prompts to allow it to auto-update, first the software itself, then it will prompt you for a driver update. Allowing it to update itself via the software brings will bring your display driver to the most current iteration; Im even being prompted to download current game-ready drivers now.Hope this helps as ive seen a bunch of people express concern re: the driver support on this card. Aside from that, this has been a solid performer with no major concerns for my use-case as a dedicated workstation GPU. 100% would recommend."", 'I have an audio workstation that runs 3 screens and was tired of juggling various connections on previous graphics cards(VGA, DVI, DP, HDMI) so I grabbed this card and a batch of HDMI cables.

For me, it works great, I no longer need a bunch of adapters and its dead quiet(important as the tower is next to my leg while I edit audio tracks in Pro tools).', 'First off, I need to say my rating is not for the product itself. The product is a a5/5, it meets my expectations for a PCIe 2.0 GPU with only 2G memory. I only got this GPU because a desktop I turned into a headless server refused to boot without a GPU of some kind and my CPU has no integrated graphics. Since I also wanted to use the full lane x16 slot of a 4x M.2 card, I needed something that would fit into a x1 slot. Works perfect to allow the machine to boot, get into the bios, and get an image when the OS is running though I doubt I will ever actually hook this machine up to a monitor again.The reason for this rating is because I purchased it in new condition, it was obviously used at least once. The sticker to seal the box was already cut, the tape on the ESD bag scrunched together barely holding the bag close, and one of the hdmi port covers was not in the card but just thrown into the box. Since everything is working and appears to be in the box, I’m not going to return it. Plus, currently used ones would only save me like $6 so I don’t think it’s worth dealing with a return. Though, I am leaving this warning for others. My order seller was Amazon, not some third party…If Asus is reading this, please talk with Amazon about selling open/used products as new! It should have been listed as “Used – Like New” condition or refurbished.

Le gain de perfs par rapport à ma 1080 ( non TI ) est stratosphérique, tout tourne à fond en 1440p .Bref, la ventilation n\' est pas à négliger, si j\' avais su j\' aurais envisagé la version waterblock pour plus de confort ! Après quelques optimisations ( changement de boitier et plus de ventilos ), j\' escompte obtenir quelque chose de correct au niveau auditif !Pas de problème de pilote et l\' application "" Adrenalin "" est vraiment top, bien mieux qu\' Nivida de ce côté-là, AMD ne rigole plus .', ""La gpu è chiaramente ancora acerba lato driver, è risaputo che con amd è cosi, la custom in particolare scalda più di altre concorrenti.Il problema sono le VENTOLE, dovete attivarle almeno al 60%, non potete pensare di dissipare 355w (che in realtà stock sale a 375-380w) tenendo le ventole al 40%.Completamente stock le temperature che salgono riguardano principalmente il punto più caldo, ovvero l'hotspot (la scheda ha 5 sensori diversi hotspot, cosa che nvidia non pubblica/dichiara) arriva anche a 105 gradi con le ventole stock.

Il tutto per poterla mantenere più fresca possibile"", ""I bought the RX 7900 XTX to upgrade my gaming PC and I am very happy with my purchase. This card is a beast and can handle any game I throw at it with ease. Here are some of the things I liked about it:- The RGB lighting is amazing and customizable. I synced it up with my ASUS Hero X 570 motherboard using Armory Crate and made it react to music, sounds, games, and movies. It looks awesome and adds to the immersion.- The price is very reasonable for the performance. It is way cheaper than the RTX 4080 and performs about the same or even better in some cases. It is definitely worth the money.- The cooling and noise are excellent. I haven't had any coil whine even on overclocked mode and at 100% load. The fans are quiet and keep the card cool under stress. The card ran at about 85°C on quiet mode and sometimes lower, and about 95°C on overclock mode. It has a max safe temp of 110°C according to AMD before throttling happens, but it never reached that for me.- The features are impressive. I like the AMD Freesync technology that eliminates screen tearing and stuttering. I also like the Adrenaline UI that lets me tweak the settings, monitor the performance, and update the drivers easily. The card performed much better after I updated the driver with Adrenaline, so make sure to do a clean install on any card to avoid problems.- The design is sleek and sturdy. The card has a metal backplate and a black and red color scheme that matches my build. It also has a dual BIOS switch that lets me choose between performance and quiet modes.- The AMD Smart Access Memory is a bonus. I used a Ryzen 7 3800x CPU and it ran just fine with no bottlenecking. This feature allows the CPU to access more of the GPU memory, boosting the performance even further.- The switch from Nvidia to AMD was smooth and satisfying. I always used Nvidia cards before, but this was my first time going with an AMD graphics card. I'm really glad I gave AMD a chance. They have improved a lot and offer great products at competitive prices.- **The performance in different games was amazing. I monitored three games in AMD Adrenaline and here are the results:**  **Hogwarts Legacy: No ray tracing, quiet mode, ultra settings with AMD FSR quality, 4K resolution with a 120 FPS cap (because that's my gaming TV's refresh rate). With a playtime of 68 minutes in the castle area mainly, I got an average FPS of 87.5. The game looked stunning and ran smoothly.  **Destroy All Humans: Max settings, quiet mode, 4K resolution with a 120 FPS cap. With a playtime of 47 minutes, I got an average FPS of 103.8. It stayed at 120 FPS most of the time except when I went into the saucer, but it stayed above 100 FPS. The game was fun and responsive.  **Spyro Reignited Trilogy: Max settings, quiet mode, 4K resolution with a 120 FPS cap. With a playtime of 21 minutes, I got an average FPS of 111.4. It stayed at 120 FPS most of the time as well. The game was colorful and smooth.The RX 7900 XTX is a great graphics card that delivers amazing performance, features, and aesthetics. It can run any game at high resolutions and settings without breaking a sweat. It is also cheaper and quieter than its competitors. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a powerful and affordable gaming card. You won't regret it!"", 'I\'ve been building and designing systems for almost 25 years now.  When I began, AMD was the king of the CPU world.  After a while, Intel stepped up and took the performance/value bracket top spot.  I\'ve been waiting for AMD to pick the ball back up and take center court.  I feel we are just about there with CPU and GPU performance / value.  I purchased the Red Devil 7900XT and am currently running it on a Z390 chipset (preemptive decision for next year\'s build as it was on sale) so I\'m not getting the ""full"" performance beings it\'s PCIe 3 (no bottleneck with CPU or RAM, etc).I\'ve been thoroughly impressed with it\'s performance all around.  The software is extensive and detailed, though it threw a curve ball at me because I\'m used to evga X1, or Afterburner.  The adrenalin suite has everything you need, entirely.  I hear people mention coil whine, but I think that is likely due to the stability and, or accuracy of the 12v rail on their PSU  (you\'d be surprised at how many top brands have fluctuation on the 12v).  I am running mine on a Corsair RM750x and only notice a slight coil whine while under load on certain games.  That comes from an inconsistency in my 12v rail.  When I benched the card on an 850 PSU, the coil whine was not there.  My next build (in a few months) will include a Titanium rated Seasonic PSU, so I\'m not worried about the  tight tolerances on this card. Note for others considering this card, I would suggest a platinum or titanium rated PSU for this card, 850w or 1000w.Aside from that, it runs games like Diablo 4, Baldur\'s Gate 3, DRG, DnD Dark Alliance at 144fps @ 2560x1440  and I\'ve yet to see it over 60c temps.  It does put out some heat, but the fans are quiet, if they\'re even on.Lighting options and control via Adrenalin are more than sufficient for my tastes, I\'m sure it\'s capable of doing more, but I like the ripple or meteor effect.  I would also add this card is made for a vertical installation.  While the lights look cool directly installed into a PCIe slot, they would put on a more grand show in a vertical mount installation.Highly recommend this card, especially for anyone on the fence between this and a 40 series card.  Far more value with this card.  Keep in mind, my recommendation is for the 7900XT.  I\'m not a big fan of the ""buffed"" up cards offered by either GPU manufacturer.', 'So for anyone that has been looking to upgrade their PC GPU and have been thinking that AMD might meet the criteria for you or is a better option than Nvidia because of pricing, I just want to give a heads up that my experience with the AMD RX 7900XTX was not quite as advertised to start with i had issues with HDR and Freesync working properly together also if your running triples the performance in (Rfactor 2) (Iracing) (ACC) Are unfortunately worse than my RTX 3080 for instance in Iracing on my RTX 3080 i would get 65 to 80 FPS in a race at resolution 7680x1440p the same resolution on the AMD card was 30 FPS now with Rfactor 2 it varied on my 3080 but most the time i was able to get 55-85 depending on situation now on the AMD side same resolution i was on getting 20-30 FPS, ACC i was getting 85 FPS on the RTX 3080 and on the AMD i was getting 85 FPS which was the only title were it was equal which this may get better in the Future if they ever get the Drivers fixed.Now with that said if you are on a single panel screen or using VR it is a amazing piece of Hardware in VR on High settings and 100% res scale I was able to achieve 83-90 FPS and on my 3080 it was more like 30 FPS so huge improvements and in DCS i was able to achieve 60 FPS with triple screen with HIGH settings to ultra, and COD i was getting 154 FPS on the Samsung Odyssey G9 on High settings so the card is not a piece of Trash but if your on Triples currently this Card for SimRacing is not a good option so hope if you were thinking of a upgrade this is helpful for you.', '1080P 144Hz 27"" LG monitor, Paired with a Ryzen 9 5950X, I get around 60-130+ FPS on ULTRA Ray Tracing settings in Cyberpunk 2077, temps max out at 65C, running benchmark shows 73.34 Average (51-103FPS).

Temperature wise, this card runs at 100% with hotspot temps in the low 80s. It's also far, FAR quieter than my 3080ti at any fan speed.It is big. Not as big as a 4090, but BIG, and it was a serious pain to install into my system.The most major con with this card is I ended up having to download and apply a windows registry modification for it to properly support multimonitors.

It does come with a GPU stand/brace, a Red Devil 3d sticker/badge, a 3 pin ARGB cord for syncing with motherboard. You do not need the 3 pin cord for the Red RGB lights to work, only if you want to change the RGB colors and sync with MB will you need the 3 pin.

I run the card at temperatures between 54 and 58 degrees Celsius and high FPS on all simulators.  These RTX cards, particularly the ones from EVGA, are already overclocked at stock.  I tried overclocking the GPU to 2,100Mhz with no great gain in FPS.  The algorithms on those simulators don't seem to allow FPS to increase by more than a few even with high OC settings.The best use with the RTX cards is to work with as little voltage as possible, as the silicon allows (I only allow 840mV max to feed this GPU), and maintain a clock speed between 1,930Mhz and 1,960Mhz.  I don't see more than 220 Watts during heavy loads, with an average of 200 Watts across all three platforms, as compared to the 320 watts at stock.  This, while playing MSFS 2020 at Ultra settings, with the fans barely spinning and barely audible.  The GPU came to me with a stock 84 degree Celsius and all fans spinning out control...  In three weeks, I reduced the operating temps by about 30 degrees and quieted the fans to a minimum, all with gains in FPS and plenty of stability.  The advantage with this card, at least for me, was the available 12 GBs of VRAMs in a powerful RTX GPU.  Heat / voltage / FPS can be improved very easily with lots of testing and some crazy calculations that I developed when I learnt to 'quiet' my 2070 Super in 2020.  I run this much cooler and at much lower frequencies than my 2070 Super and gained about 20 / 30 FPS on average.I am looking at doing the same to the RTX 3090 now, which I prefer only because of the extra 12 GB of VRAM.  Starve them and keep them cold and they'll behave.  No custom loop required!"", ""I bought an rtx 3080 ti 6 months ago and it has been an absolute nightmare. It started to just turn my entire PC off on its own, first while I was gaming and eventually when I was doing nothing but browsing youtube. I RMA'd it and got sent a replacement, where I was ASSURED that the GPU was completely fine. SAME THING KEPT HAPPENING WITH THE REPLACEMENT GPU.  So I spent the next few months replacing LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE OTHER PART in my PC down to the nvme ssd I had, AND STILL same issue. Only now its WORSE and has locked my pc into a BSOD loop that won't even let me get to the login screen. I take the RTX 3080 ti out and replace it with my gtx 1080 and everything works FINE. Cannot believe I was sent a defective card TWICE and spent half a year stressed out and straight up lied to by evga. And now when I contacted them again for a second rma, they're denying anythings wrong. Horrible company, horrible product, even worse service. NEVER BUYING ANYTHING FROM THEM EVER AGAIN."", ""Very impressed with this card, upgraded from the evga 3060 shown in pic this card ofcourse is much larger as expected.  I saw a lot of people talking about how hot this card runs and I think it is important to say yes it does make a ton of heat but the cooler is definitely adequate as far as I can tell.  When gaming I run normally 78 to 80c and memory temps stay around 88c to 90c which is not terrible, I do have a custom fan curve setup which I feel is smart to do, your fans will be running around 80% or so when gaming if you want to keep your temps right which is not that bad for me atleast.  I was using msi afterburner for my fan curves but it started acting weird and sometimes wouldnt work so I use EVGA's precision x1 software which works pretty well so far.  I mostly have played cyberpunk, rdr2, fallout4 since I got the card just the games im playing at this time and it will run all of them at basically maxed out settings with well over 60fps.  I leave ray tracing off on cyberpunk it seems to not really be worth it for the fps decrease.If your case doesnt have decent airflow then I would definitely expect all of your temps to rise because it does expell some heat basically turns your computer into a space heater.The PSU im using is the corsair hx850 which is more than enough to run this card along with my i9 10850k"", 'For years I was searching reddit ""gpu gaming at 1080p"" etc ya know how it goes. Ended up with the 1660 TI and before that a 7970 GHZ edition, but was always underwhelmed. Struggled a lot at max settings with 1080p in modern AAA titles and forget ray tracing.So I decided to go all out and buy this card, found one listed for around $870. I didn\'t read the fine print before purchasing and it ended up being used. I received the card in a generic Amazon box but was well packaged. The card itself was in immaculate condition and wouldn\'t have guessed it was second hand besides the packaging.Paired with a 3800x and 16 GB of RAM, never had the system memory be a bottleneck and could max settings at 1080 and 1440 w/ rt easily, and most at 2160.Now with a month under my belt this seems like a good buy for a powerful card that\'ll last for years.']"

A Pleasant surprise.The Best thing is the price. $309 for a used item that looks like brand new.

Junction max temp got up to 99C. I changed the FAN profile in MSI Afterburner to make the fans run more aggressively (they got louder but no problem with music from simulator). Max GPU Junction Temp then dropped below 95C.  With FSR2.0, the max GPU utilization drops significantly below 99%.This GPU looks like a keeper.

Stattdessen föhnt sie fröhlich mit 1280 rpm vor sich hin. 500/min oder gar 0 hätten es sicher auch getan.Wenn der Rechner irgendwo unterm Schreibtisch stehen würde, wäre das sicherlich gar kein Kritikpunkt, aber so direkt auf dem Schreibtisch stört es einfach.Im Normalen Spielebetrieb nutzt die Karte ihre 170W (bei mir) nicht aus und ist dann auch leiser als die zuvor verbaute MSI 1060 GTX AERO ITX 6GB (Bild 2 unten), welche inzwischen hier und da an ihre Grenzen stößt.Das 230W-Netzteil des Trident konnte den PC weiterhin mühelos betreiben (trotz des i7 8700).Daher gäbe es eigentlich 5 Sterne, aber für den unnötigen Krach im Leerlauf gibts einen Punkt abzug und die Karte geht deshalb nach 2 Tagen zurück.

Coming from a GTX 960 paired with an i5 6400, this GPU absolutely blew me away in gaming when I paired it up with a Ryzen 7 3700x. It handles many games at the aforementioned resolutions without an issue. It comes with the EVGA logo in ARGB, so it changes colors, which is nice. Also, this card is kind of long, about 285.242mm or 11.23 inches according to PCPartpicker...so make sure it fits in your case!Anyways, I've had it in my system for about a week now and here's the rundown of the GOOD, the NEUTRAL, and the BAD of this card, along with some ballpark FPS numbers you can expect with this card on a few games I play most (keep in mind I have it paired with a 3700x and 16GB of dual channel, CL18 3600MHz ram in a Fractal Design Meshify C case, so YMMV):GOOD:-Temps are good, I've yet to see it go above 70C during full load and it maxes out at 40C when idle.-It's not loud at full load. No coil whine. Fans are off at idle. Can't ask for much more.-1440p at 144FPS and 4K at 60FPS on High-Ultra settings is achievable on most AAA games.NEUTRAL:-No backplate on this card (I don't mind that much, but some might).BAD:-Box the GPU was in was damaged upon delivery, long dent vertically down the right side of the GPU box. No padding whatsoever in the Amazon box. (More of an Amazon issue so I blame them rather than the card itself for this one, won't deduct a star here).FPS NUMBERS at 1440p:-Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War: 144FPS, a few dips into the 120s when there's a lot going on. High presets.-Forza Horizon 4: 144FPS on Ultra.-Microsoft Flight Simulator: Runs at about 40-45FPS with High/Ultra presets.FPS NUMBERS at 4K:-Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War: 60FPS with Ray Tracing OFF.

So is able to utilize power from 2 sets of VGA ports.', 'EDIT 2: Have now tested the card with 6 monitors (first newest pic -- not to be confused with the older, mismatched size monitors in previous pics, where one was running off an RPi). The active/powered MST hub I attached works, and it DOES support all 6 screens, no additional configurations needed (even on Linux! as that\'s what I use).[NOTE: MST stands for Multi-Stream Transport, and it is the ability of later DisplayPort and Mini DisplayPort to attach 2 or 3 monitors to the same DP connector that show as physically separate screens (NOT just duplicating the screen the way some HDMI ""splitters"" do)].I have tested this with both 1080p and 720p (I use 720, because my eyes are just too bad to see the smaller text, and previous scaling settings sometimes conflicted with certain programs), and both settings work fine.I am very impressed, overall, with how much this card is able to do.Other than OC on Linux or downclocking the VRAM, the only other things I can think another user might need to test are higher res monitors (I will NOT be testing that, due to eyes) and VR performance (probably will not be able to test this myself for at least a while, if I even am able to, at all, with my awful eyesight).Looking back at the original review, though, I DO have to update a couple other things:1) I have not experienced that screeching noise in a long time. It might have been a wire I was using.2) When I wrote that fan controller, it is no longer quieter than my RPi, although it is still quieter than my new high-powered fans (in other newest pic).3) I have tried it with some games, and it plays them fine. It also benches really well on Heaven -- I tested it a while back across a 2x2 of my monitors (before buying the newest ones) with max spec and 3D anaglyph, and it still ran well, so you can easily use this for most games.-----EDIT 1: Have now had card for about a year, and I\'ve added more monitors to it, as you\'ll see in my newest pics. It\'s still going strong, but I did replace the thermal paste on the sink with Arctic MX 4.I find that I was able to lower temps on it by getting more powerful fans and improving cable management.Have written software to control the fans and clock on it from a Web UI, but I have had no luck getting it to overclock to the supposed 1386MHz, nor have I had any luck clocking down the VRAM. Perhaps that is the curse of using Linux, but I USUALLY use it just to run many screens, so I don\'t particularly NEED to OC the GPU clock. Would be nice if the VRAM clock rate could stay down, though, to save power -- the issue I\'ve had with that is that it keeps going back up to 2000MHz right after I write to the /sys/ driver file; screens flicker as it clocks the VRAM down, but then it goes right back up. IDK if such an issue exists on other 580s, so I can\'t rate that down, b/c it might not have anything to do with XFX.---------ORIGINAL REVIEW:So far, seems to be working quite well. I am currently using it with 3 displays (2x 1080p monitors and 1x 1680x1050 TV -- aspect ratio sucks on the TV and can\'t display 1080p w/o part of the screen falling off the sides -- not the card\'s fault; it does that on whatever it\'s connected to).All of them are connected to the displayport connectors using DP to HDMI cables.Monitoring it from my sensors program, it tends to run (after having warmed up) between 47-50°C idle, or around 49-52° with a YT video playing. Have not actually tried it for gaming or mining yet, though.Pretty much noiseless. My Rasp Pi with coolers is actually louder than this card.Do, however, recommend that your case be designed with airflow in mind, and maybe get more powerful fans. When I was using a positive-pressure design, the air passing over it and through the holes in the PCIe slots was not enough, and it both idled around 53-55°C, AND it pushed my CPU temps up by around 5-7°, as well (CPU is right above it). Changed this, and both cooled down by several degrees.Running it with Debian GNU+Linux, and as long as you have the amdgpu driver installed, it seems to have no issues. Sadly, have not found any software to control its clocks or fans through GNU+Linux, though.NOTE: It\'s important to know that it actually registers as an RX 470/480. I talked with someone about this, and it\'s because it uses the same Polaris chips, just clocked up and updated.Couple little glitches that sorta irk me, but not enough to bring down score:1) Sometimes, it produces a low screeching-like noise on startup for each monitor. Probably a signal transfer thing. Weird, only happens sometimes, a little annoying, scared me a bit at first.2) It also causes my BIOS screen to flicker several times after POSTing and before the bootloader runs. Also freaked me out the first couple times, but now I\'m used to it.Neither of the aforementioned glitches occurred when using my Ryzen 5 2400G iGPU (before purchasing this card), so I think it has something to do with the card itself (could be the wires, though, but I have no other DP devices to test them with). Not major, but things that I paid attention to, nonetheless. As far as I\'m aware, if you experience this, it\'s not an actual issue, just a quirk -- will update on that if I need to, though.', ""Trying to register this card, XFX's website requires you to fill in all the blanks with all your information, including Billing & Shipping.  WTF should I have to give out all this personal information (that can be hacked from their site) just so I can register this card?  Contacting them about this issue?  Same shit.  Not gonna bother registering this product.  If it craps out, it craps out.  I'll just never buy another thing from XFX ever again.  I'm not giving out all my personal information for a $120 graphics card.  Screw that.Having said all that, the graphics card is good for what it is.  I won't be using it much for gaming, but as a test bench for testing software downloads in case they contain malware.  It has an unactivated copy of Windows 10 Pro (which has no watermark, nor prevents me from customizing settings that you can't normally customize without activation) with no personal information stored on it, so in the event it contracts a virus, I can simply wipe the drive and reload.  I might use this system to test some free games, so the 8GB of VRAM would be better than the 4GB GT 730 I previously had in it.This card also works with the very latest Adrenalin software and drivers, so it's still a supported graphics card.  So, again, if you don't care to register this card with all your personal information, nor are you running Triple-A games, then this card will fit most bills."", 'Diciamolo subito: L\'architettura GCN su cui si basa questa RX-580 è sicuramente un\'architettura per nulla giovane; tuttavia questa GPU ha ancora tanto da offrire, pur facendo risparmiare anche cifre considerevoli rispetto alla concorrenza più attuale.XFX poi ha praticamente messo il massimo che si poteva su questa scheda, offrendola praticamente al prezzo più basso. Ma andiamo con ordine:PORTE:Dotazione probabilmente standard da questa categoria in su, ma ho apprezzato molto la presenza anche della vecchia DVI-D, oltre a ben 3 DP e una HDMI. Faccio notare che non ci sono uscite analogiche integrate, solo digitali.ALIMENTAZIONE:Vi servirà un BUON alimentatore da almeno 500W per andare sul sicuro, con cavo PCI-EX. Il connettore di alimentazione è ad 8 pin, ma nella confezione troverete anche un adattatore da 6 ad 8 pin, nel caso ne abbiate bisogno.MATERIALI E FABBRICAZIONE:XFX ha fatto davvero un bel lavoro, inserendo componentistica di qualità, con ottimi VRM (i regolatori di corrente e tensione), un back plate nero in metallo che oltre all\'estetica conferisce solidità, doppia ventola e copertura in plastica con look al carbonio, una sciccheria. Completa la dotazione il massiccio dissipatore heat pipe, ben 8 GB di memoria GDDR5 e, ovviamente, la GPU AMD RX-580.E\' presente un piccolo led che si illumina di rosso se l\'alimentazione è insufficiente, di blu se è tutto OK.RAFFREDDAMENTO E CONSUMO:Non ho avuto modo di misurare il consumo effettivo, ma il mio alimentatore da 450W tiene tranquillamente il mio Ryzen 5 3600, la XFX RX-580 e tutto il resto senza fare una piega, quindi di sicuro non è estremamente affamata di energia.Il dissipatore e le ventole la mantengono sempre sotto gli 80° anche sotto carico; a piena potenza non hanno mai raggiunto la rotazione massima, mantenendosi molto poco rumorose durante il gaming e praticamente mute durante l\'uso desktop. Forse è anche merito della buona ventilazione del mio case, ma dal punto di vista raffreddamento e silenzio sono estremamente soddisfatto. Ah, le ventole sono estraibili.PRESTAZIONI:Ancora oggi, con titoli a 1080P e settings a volte medi ma anche a volte alti a seconda del gioco, vi regala un frame rate sopra i 50 FPS.Giusto per un esempio, col benchmark Superposition unigine 2 a 1080P e dettagli medi, il frame rate non è mai sceso sotto i 50 fps mantenendo la media di 59 fps e ottenendo un punteggio di quasi 8000 punti.Riesce inoltre a gestire senza alcun problema la risoluzione mostruosa di 5120X1440 del mio monitor super ultra wide a 120 hz; dopo averla montata ed installato i driver, è stato tutto un altro mondo, è come se gli oggetti sul desktop scorressero senza alcun attrito, talmente tutto è fluido.PREZZO:179€ per questa scheda nel 4° trimestre 2019 sono un vero affare, considerato tutto quello che ha da offrire.CONCLUSIONI:Se siete alla ricerca di una scheda video che offra prestazioni oneste e valide, con budget sui 200€, la RX-580 è ancora oggi una scelta valida. Potreste optare per la versione pompata RX-590, che tra le altre cose è realizzata con un processo produttivo migliore; tuttavia i pochi fps che guadagnereste non ne giustificano la spesa superiore. Inoltre il clock più spinto, nonostante la litografia migliore, la rende identica alla 580 quanto a rumore e consumi.Quindi, secondo me, la RX-580 è ancora oggi la miglior scheda video budget per rapporto qualità/prezzo, sotto i 200€.E questa versione di XFX è probabilmente la migliore, in quanto ha poco o nulla da invidiare ai marchi più importanti, e offre TUTTO quello che offrono i concorrenti, pur costando meno.Vi ricordo inoltre che per questo prezzo avrete anche ben OTTO GIGA di video ram; la sua diretta concorrente, la GTX 1660 di nVidia, costa anche quasi 100€ in più e monta ""solo"" 6 GB; certo, offre prestazioni superiori, ma il divario è netto solo su alcuni titoli; ribadisco che a 1080P, se vi accontentate, con la XFX RX-580 risparmierete molto.Infatti la consiglio a chi ha un budget limitato; chi può spendere, sa bene che troverà architetture migliori, più giovani e potenti.', 'interesante tarjeta de video buena, bonita y barata!

This was back when Amazon did a promo that involved using the mobile app for the first time. When you did you got 10 dollars off your next order. With that out of the way...(Please note all reports below have this GPU, an Intel I5-2400 @ 3.10ghz CPU and 8GB of RAM. Your results will vary unless you have my exact setup!)Yeah this runs all the games I want it to run. Please set expectations low as this is an old card. Remember no game out there released after 2012 will hit 60+ FPS consistantly on this thing. This is absolutely perfect for my use. I have included some reports below so you can gague how it might work for you:Apex Legends: Runs below average. I had to run in 720 resolution fullscreen with all graphics turned down to min. Framerate averaged at 15, lowest 10.Fortnite: Average by my standards. Same graphics settings as Apex (720 resolution, graphics turned down to min). 17 FPS average, lowest 15.Kerbal Space Program: This one surprised me. I\'m unsure resolution but it seems windowed mode 800*600 (whatever default is) but you can ALT+ENTER to make it fullscreen. Average framerate during normal play was 40 FPS, while exploding or operating a huge vessel with alot of parts it got as low as 5 FPS. Don\'t go crazy and you\'re fine. (NOTE: this was without any graphical mods EXCEPT ""realplume"")Paladins: Flawless running! I actually ran a match without changing anything in graphics and got 60+ FPS with a less-than-occasionalll dip to high 40 FPS. Checked it afterward and everything was maxed out at my native resolution (1680*1050 16:10). I was pleasently surprisedRocket League: This one is tough for me. This game is the whole reason I bought this card. All graphical settings set to ""performance"" and transparent goalposts set to on it gets 20-35 FPS. Not ideal at all for an action game such as this. Running fullscreen at 800*600 helps a bit but not alot.Runescape (NX client): Let\'s be honest, who plays RuneScape current-day anymore? Well I did to benchmark it. Graphics maxed out got me 4 FPS, just like 2004 did for me. I got used to it back then so I accepted that for this game. With graphics relaxed a bit I got 20 FPS average across various parts of the F2P map.Runescape (old school): This is what I\'ve been playing the most the past couple of days so this data is fresh in my mind. You can\'t change the graphics much so there\'s only pure FPS to talk about: 60+ FPS all the way around here. It\'s expected for a graphics engine from 2007.Sid Meier\'s Civilation 5 (Directx9): I have the Steam version so it launches in either DX9 or DX10/11. DX9 version runs just fine at 30 FPS with maxed out graphics.Sid Meier\'s Civilation 5 (Directx10/11): Man this version of the game just feels smoother, even though nothing is different except animations. Still 30-50 FPS but it just feels better for some reason.Subnautica: Smooth as silk for the most part. Minus any effects emitted from the world (giant gun or Aurora\'s reactor anyone?) I have never hit framerates below 20. Audio seemed desynced from world events such as those named above but that may have just been a result of my pausing the game right as it started both times.Valorant: Not my best experience but definately not my worst. Graphics turned down to minimum and resolution down to 720 it ran. Notice I didn\'t say it ran ""ok"". It was playable at 10 FPS but my lack of skill in games like this is no excuse for performance.Warframe: Turn the graphics down a bit and you have a good experience. Using the classic graphics and a turned-down resolution gets me 25-60 FPS depending on what\'s going on. Missions run 25-40 FPS, Fortuna ran at 30-35 FPS. I\'m not far into it so good luck Tenno.', ""I bought this for an Inspiron 3647 running Windows 10 and it took me ELEVEN hours to figure out how to install it...because I'm a noob. Solution is in last paragraph if you don't want to read about my trials and tribulations.My pc has only VGA and HDMI for monitor output, and the HDMI quit working. I wanted to have a dual monitor setup and I had an empty PCIe slot, so I figured I'd get a graphics card. My main monitor was VGA and I was hoping to get the 2nd (an old monitor I brought from work so I could work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic) into HDMI. Got the card inserted into the slot and powered everything back up. BLACK SCREEN!!! Not even the integrated graphics VGA worked! I had no clue what to do! I powered down, took the graphics card back out and was able to see via the VGA again.The product did not come with a cd for the driver, so I went to the NVIDIA website to download it. Got the .exe going, but it wouldn't let me run the install wizard because it couldn't detect the card. (Nooo duhhh...because I had to take the card out to even SEE how to get to the website to download the driver!!!) Only the integrated graphics showed up under display in Device Manager.I thought that maybe my HDMI cable was bad so I tested them out with the laptop. They worked great. Turns out the old monitor from work was no good. Back to the drawing board. I scoured tons of forums for solutions and pored over them for hours.One solution was to boot up in safe mode and enable the PCIe slot in BIOS. So, I go to BIOS and there is absolutely NOTHING about graphics, video interface, northbound or southbound (or whatever it is) settings...NOTHING. Spent about an hour trying to read up on BIOS and where else it could possibly be. Couldn't find a thing. So I decided to look up if I should update my BIOS. After all, I was running version A04. I got conflicting answers about whether or not I should - this did not really help me at all.I tried to find out how I could even update the BIOS...I didn't know where to go. My search led me to Dell's website, where I input the service code of my pc and it showed me about 11 different updates it needed to do - one of which was a BIOS marked URGENT! Matter of fact, it was wanting to update to BIOS version A11!!! No WONDER I was having trouble! Intel's website told me, if I understood it correctly,  that I could not use an external graphics card in addition to the integrated graphics card...that only one would be active. That bummed me out because in order to make the graphics card fit, I had to take off the VGA port and install it with the smallest bracket, which only left me with HDMI and DVI. I was hoping to use the integrated VGA and the HDMI on the new graphics card.Solution: I updated my BIOS to the latest version, enabled Intel Multi-Display in BIOS, and was then able to continue the NVIDIA control panel installation, which enabled my new graphics card. I was also able to use the integrated VGA AND the HDMI on the new graphics card with no trouble! Hopefully, this poor sap is able to help another poor sap out. :)Con: My only con (other than the legwork required for me to install it - but that is most likely due to my pc being old) is that the fan is noisier than I expected."", ""Update: 10-01-2020 Good news the driver / software left behind after I removed the card and uninstalled was NOT causing the problems with the built in core i3 CPU's onboard video chip - the heat sink mounted to the CPU had gotten loose and after I locked the plastic intel hold downs all problems went away.Update: 06-27-2018 still working great on my desktop PC running windows 8.1x but... now and then I have had top reboot. I recently got windows monthly roll up quarterly updates.  Closed all programs, installed and rebooted. Then I noticed all windows / programs were solid black.  I rebooted and the problem was gone.  At other random times I have have had a single program do this.  Never happened in the prior 8 years I have owned this computer and running the built in graphics on the core i3 chop.  Not a deal breaker but something to be aware of.Low power consumption!! I used my kill-a-watt meter and on one computer the power consumption was identical to the core i3 with built in video and on the computer I am using now it is around 3 to 5 watts extra at idle compared to before I installed the video card.  Running temperature is very cool - I ran the MSI torture test and put my hand on the fan-less heat sink and it was barely warm!  Normally it is room temperature.Excellent.  I don't play video games but I do some home video editing with Corel VideoStudio but.... I started using a program called Sketchup (SU) which is used to for architectural building design and 3D modeling in general.  The problem is the latest and last two free versions of the program SU 2016 and SU2017 require a newer version of OpenGL.  My OpenGL my existing home built computer is a Intel first generation  core i3 socket LGA1156 computer with an MSI MS-7587 H57M ED65 chip set motherboard that only supports OpenGL 2.0. I discovered that I could not simply download software driver with a newer version of OpenGL because the hardware I had would not support it. So I started searching for a video card.  I had no Idea what card would work but amazingly I discovered that my 7+ year old computer supported PCIE or PCI-E 16X 2.0 which meant I could use almost any video card including this one.Install.... I highly recommend using backup software that makes a full image of your computer as this is the mother of all installs!  I used ghost to backup my windows 8.1 install. I rebooted and then started the install.  Wow I was blown away with the size of the driver 1.5 Gigabytes!!!!! WOW - largest driver I have ever installed.  Normally, a driver might be a few megabytes!Next, it asked if I wanted to install the updates.  I should have said no and rebooted then installed updates.  Result - when I rebooted the screen was blank.  I hit the power switch and rebooted and everything is fine.  About a day later I had my android phone hooked up by usb to transfer pictures and I disconnected because the copy froze and I was forced to reboot.  That problem never happened and fortunately has not happened since.CONS: invasive - huge huge driver install.  I normally, run about 7 programs and tons of tabs in my firefox browser.  I minimize everything and set my computer to go to sleep after 20 min and hibernate after 2 hours.  When I start the computer up after hibernating and open the programs minimized to the task bar then are reduce in size about 1/3 of the screen and aligned in the top left corner so I have to resize the window.  Never had the problem until I installed the video card but I can live with it.Second con - there is zero performance improve in my system even when using VideoStudio X9.  The only thing the video card does for me is allow me to run SketchUp 2017. Possibly I might run dual monitors in the future.  The point is that the power and features of the card mainly apply to video games and possibly VR? but for the average desktop user you won't notice a difference with this card or any other brand."", 'This review is centered around a very specific use-case, so it\'s not so much a product review as it is a confirmation that it\'ll work for a particular purpose.  Just thought I\'d share in case someone else might be in a similar situation...I bought this specifically to install in my old 2012 Dell PowerEdge T310, which runs Frigate, so that i could have hardware-accelerated H.264 decoding.  I wanted something that was low power, as the PowerEdge servers don\'t supply more than 25W to the PCIe ports.The GT 710 is so old that it\'s not even listed on Nvidia\'s ""Video Encode and Decode GPU Support Matrix"" -- lots of forums talk about this and people say that since it\'s not on the list, it doesn\'t support NVDEC.  Well, it does work.  Just install the version 470 drivers (not the latest) -- for Ubuntu, it\'s ""nvidia-headless-470-server"" and ""libnvidia-decode-470-server"" packages.Anyway, these cards are probably too old to be truly useful in a desktop these days, but perfect for a headless system to offload video decoding for something like Frigate.', '(Review is for the GT 710 2GD3 LP)-----------------------------------------------------UPDATE 12/17/2019:I just picked  up a new HDTV, the Samsung 43"" model UN43NU6900BXZA which offers 4K and UHD.

Details, fine text, screen fit, contrast, color...etc...it all looks superb.If you are considering a 4K display upgrade, YES, this card will work perfectly with it!---------------------------I needed an inexpensive card to upgrade my Mac Pro 5.1 mid-2012 and this card works perfectly for that. No power cable needed and a very small profile that won\'t get in the way of other cards and slots. It is self powered by the PCIe bus so no power cable was needed.Of course there is no boot screen during boot nor a way to select which drive to boot from if you have more than one OS drive. You can easily though, change the ""start-up"" drive once the OS is booted and loaded in System Preferences, so not a big deal for me.I am using the HDMI output to a Samsung 1080 HDTV and there was no need to tweak screen fit or anything. The card booted right up to a perfect screen display.I\'ve tried a few other Apple recommended cards in the past and honestly, none did any better than this. I returned one at over $150 simply because I decided to wait for a lower priced card to do the same thing and this MSI card does!  Additionally, this card seems to wake my Mac out of sleep very quickly. The older cards I tried seemed very sluggish to do that, this card seems much more responsive to wake my Mac. A Win-Win in here!HMDI won\'t pass the audio, but, no cards out there will do that unless specifically made for a Mac Pro and flashed correctly. I have optical and digital output on my M. Pro so not a biggie.The card seems responsive and fast and at some point I will do a ""Geekbench"" test. The 1080 on my Samsung HDTV looks crisp and clear output from this card. I would say 1080 looks slightly better on this card than my old OEM one that came installed on my Mac. Small icon seems a bit crisper and clearer. Close to the old card, but, there is definitely a bit of improvement there.The card is fan cooled and since I won\'t be gaming with this desktop, it should run very cool routinely.5 Stars all around and a great way to upgrade an older Mac Pro on the cheap.']"

I think this is probably something that could be addressed by tweaking the fan curves a little, something I haven't done.

HOWEVER, the fans will click-clack for a few seconds when the motor kicks on and it gets up to speed. It\'s not very loud and it\'s considered ""normal operating behavior"" of the GPU.What\'s annoying about this is that if you\'re playing a game and your GPU is bouncing between 54-56C the fans will continuously keep turning on and off.

Overall score: 1050-1511  1660- 3087.  But the stats aren't the entire story.  From the very start of the Unigine test the graphics of the 1660 were far more clear and more crisp (at the same resolution).  The flow was visibly smoother.  The 1050 had 2 gigs of RAM and the 1660 has 6 gigs, so major increase there.  And from my experience with EVGA in the past, I trust the quality of the card.  It's not a 'cheap' card, but it's not super pricey either. If you're looking for a good mid-range gaming card, this is dandy."", ""GPU:Nvidia Super 1660 is the best value you can get today for a GPU. You can run every game on 1080p on the highest settings over 60 frames a second and the 6gb of ram provides ample memory, even the most graphics intensive games at most use 3 gb so this will future proof you.  Also this card is faster than the 1660(which is a great GPU too) but what's great is it is nearly as fast as the 1660 TI and in a few games it actually runs faster but it costs less than the 1660 TI. The 1660 super is basically a 1660 with GDDR6 memory but the memory is even faster than what is on the TI and memory is one of the most essential features in video cards now since you if you look at GPU speeds, all cards from low to high range have around the same clock speed.  The 1660/super is much better than the competition from Radeon including the new 5500.  The 1550  is basically the same thing as a rx 580, in fact its slightly slower.  ATI unfortunately does not offer very good competition and in terms of performance you get for what you spend, 1660 super is a great card. It's the best value on the market today.Board/EVGA:This is my first product from EVGA and it did not work and constantly crashed  in video games and I had to return it. At first they thought the problem is only one of the fans was showing up in the software when 2 is supposed to(although both spun) but EVGA later told me this specific card you can only control both fans not each one individually.  In any case EVGA did send me a new card that worked.  And the good thing I suppose you can put down a deposit and they you get to keep your current card while you wait for the future one.  I will say EVGA has good customer service, I had a negative opinion of this company/board but since the new card works I will say EVGA  is fine and malfunctioning video card does not seem irregular.The presentation of this card is a little ugly, normally I don't care about what a board looks like but it has tacky 'evga' imprinted all over the fans and the fans seems sort of cheap, I think they could have put more attention into it.  Although the rest of the card seems solid, the heatsink looks like its in good quality.  I read a review on techpowerup before I bought this and it said the evga fan is the loudest of the 1660 super card, but only by a few decibels. Honestly I have never heard the card but also I have a sound dampening case.  Temperature wise it runs fine, around 70 C and temperature is relative for the type of gpu.Aside from that, what is nice about the card is it has a displayport,HDMI and DVI-D.  So if you have an older monitor you can use this card with it.  Also the card is 'overclocked' by EVGA this is basically a gimmick, the boost rate of the GPU is overclocked a few megahertz and results in a frame a second faster.Video Card Board ManufacturersI bought all my parts for my computer on Amazon and they all worked great except.. video cards.  Computer Parts generally work excellent and have a very high reliability rate. You can get a computer from the 1990s and it will still run fine.  For whatever reason and I don't think it's well documented statistically, video cards have become the least stable part on a computer now and regularly have issues.  So you should pay alot of attention to reviews and the brands of the card. Also you should get the most simple version of the card if you can without alot of extra 'overclocking' which your going to pay more for these cards anyway without getting much performance improvement.In conclusion.  The GPU is a 5/5 , the card is a 3.5/5.  Get the 1660 Super if you can but be smart about the board that you buy.""]"

Questo porta a un aumento del 12,5% della larghezza di banda della memoria. Inoltre, AMD ha apportato un terzo miglioramento a livello di firmware e driver, che sembrano essere più veloci, soprattutto in scenari limitati dalla CPU.Raffreddamento: La MSI RX 6750 XT Gaming X Trio utilizza la potente soluzione di raffreddamento Tri Frozr con un grande dissipatore di calore a pinna di alluminio ventilato da tre ventole. Questo design è in grado di gestire GPU con TDP più elevati, il che significa che la 6750 XT rientra ampiamente nelle sue capacità.Costruzione: La scheda è molto ben costruita, come ci si aspetta da MSI. Ha una piastra posteriore lunga tutta la lunghezza e molta illuminazione RGB.Prezzo: Il prezzo li listino è di $549, che potrebbe sembrare alto considerando le prestazioni simili offerte dalla RX 6700 XT. Tuttavia, se riesci a trovarla al prezzo giusto, offre prestazioni eccezionali e un raffreddamento eccellente.In generale, la MSI Radeon RX 6750 XT Gaming X Trio è una scheda grafica potente e ben costruita che offre ottime prestazioni per il gaming.

En la versión X trio que nos ocupa, por lo que veo el disipador lo han reutilizado de otras versiones más potentes, pues la tarjeta se queda a mitad del disipador, quiero decir, que tenemos disipador de más para el tamaño de la tarjeta.No puedo decir nada malo al respecto de la tarjeta, pero sí un par de cosas que bueno aunque mejorables tampoco son un problema, por un lado la verizon x trio en esta tarjeta está sobre dimensionada, igual si queremos meternos con temas de OC o similar está bien, pero si no, no hace ni falta tanta tarjeta, y también decir que por el tamaño, lo ideal es que pongamos un soporte para la gráfica el cual va incluido en el pack.

Tómenlo en cuenta para sus resoluciones.En cuanto a la cantidad de VRAM creo que es adecuada pero justa. Estaba entre esta y una RTX3070 pero 8gb de VRAM en 4K es insuficiente, la prueba es que usando afterburner de MSI, he notado que juegos como Halo infinite en 4k, consumen hasta 11gb de VRAM... y Resident Evil 2 Gráficos 4k con ray tracin activado me consumió la totalidad de los 12gb de VRAM, el consumo en 1440p es de unos 9gb VRAM y en 1080p Full HD unos 7GB VRAM. lo que me deja pensando que mejor hubiera optado por una RX 6800 XT de 16GB para quedar algo sobrado.En general me gusto la tarjeta, las temperaturas, el rendimiento y el diseño.

During the height of the GPU Apocalypse where no GPU's were available, Nvidia decided every 3080 Ti that couldn't quite hit validation should be sold for more than the MSRP of $700 of the 3080 or the actual going rate of $1100 for 3080's during the worst period. They came up with the 3080 12G and released it without an official MSRP.Estimating the MSRP meant that it was about $1k, which would put it mostly between the $700 of the reference 3080 and the $1200 of the reference 3080 Ti. I waited until this card was available from Amazon at said $1k. Given that this was an OEM card and a upper tier one at that, that MSRP-like pricing seemed fair. A week later Nvidia put out an announcement that the MSRP retroactively was in fact the $999 I estimated. So I guess I'm good at math.Card is quiet except for a soft clicking sound when the fans stop. I only noticed it when my side panel was off, but I do use a Fractal Design Define 5 with no windows, which I got for the sound insulation. The heatsink is huge. I really like it. Kinda reminds me of my Noctua DH15 in bulk.It has some RGB that looks quite bright and nice, but I don't use it. My case is about cooling and I don't even have a window on the side panel (omg, I know!). So I can't tell you how well the RGB is. I also can't tell you about EVGA X1, the control software, I should be using.Instead, I am using MSI Afterburner, but I'm not overclocking. I'm undervolting at the same speeds. Card runs very hot at default settings, but that's because it has a 400 watt default power limit (higher than a lot of other 3080 12G's) and Afterburner can push it up to 450 watts if you like. I wouldn't recommend that, though. I would instead suggest lowering the voltage to get more consistent speeds without heat-related throttling, which absolutely will happen at defaults.Card could hit 1.1v doing even the most standard speeds, which I've found in testing to be pushing the limits of my case's ability to push heat out. I could have raised speeds of the fans and the EVGA card is less loud than whooshing at that.But undervolting leads to a quieter card and a faster one, too, depending on which voltage/speed you choose. Testing with Control (in 4K sans RT and DLSS Quality with RT), ER, Metro Exodus Enhanced, and Monster Hunter World I found a balance that made it run fast in games that prefer speed (ER, MHW) plus fast in games that prefer power (Control, Metro Exodus Enhanced). Most undervolt guides will tell you to change your curve via the curve editor in Afterburner to a flat performance/volt and let it stay there forever. I found that reduced performance in games that crave high megahertz without soaking up power. So I recreated the curve the card has by its nature except I optimized the voltage for each voltage level.So my card wound up being good at: 825mv - 1815mhz, 850mv - 1860mhz, 875mv - 1875mhz, 900mv - 1920mhz, 925mv - 1950mhz, 950mv - 1980mhz, 975mv - 1995mhz, 1000mv - 2010mhzThe curve editor prefers you go at 25mv intervals and clockspeeds at every 15mhz. Those numbers are for the first few minutes before heat levels hit above 70 degrees. Then they will drop down 15mhz, so 2010 becomes 1995 at the top range and 1995 becomes 1980 at the same voltage level. I shaved off the top one to keep the card from going above 1000mv, so my card doesn't go above 1995 and usually hangs around 1980 in ER at a temperature of 74 degrees, but since the card adjusts its temperature based on the performance (instead of being set at max) there are many times the card is sitting at 60 degrees (dungeons, indoors areas, anywhere really without trees and leaves blowing with terrible shadow optimizations).Speaking of Elden Ring, if you care, you should know I've played a lot of this game with this card and it's smooth 60fps except in certain places where there are lots of trees and leaves. There, you will find the card bouncing between 55 and 60. A shame, but From Software's fault probably. Head's up, though.DLSS is great. Honestly, it's amazing and seeing FSR 2.0's limitations (especially related to the weird fringing artifacts around objects that obscure other objects, DLSS is voodoo by comparison. I can definitely tell I'm using it versus native, but native usually has a worse AA method (often TAA), so you win some and you lose some. Overall, the AA offered by DLSS is really nice. Diablo 2R is a pretty heavy game, all things considered, for what it does and DLSS makes that game a walk in the park for the card. You get superior AA and the card is sitting at 60 degrees most times because the clockspeed is low.On the other end of the spectrum, Control with full ray tracing plus DLSS Quality is a power hog. It will gobble up whatever power limit you give it if you hit anywhere near the speeds I'm hitting. Some areas in that game still drop below 60fps.So, uh, card is great. Quiet. Shame they didn't just price the 3080 Ti at this price point because it's where it should have been, but this card is halfway between a 3080 and that card, it has more memory, which could come in handy as this generation of consoles starts to stop having ports capable of being run on last gen consoles as that will likely end with games having higher VRAM requirements. Plus, I think anyone gaming at 4k60 like me is going to find the higher memory bandwidth will come in handy as games get more advanced similar to how the 1080 Ti aged better compared to a 1080 (which was the card I upgraded from). My 1080 was basically a 4k30 card for the majority of its lifespan while the 1080 Ti was a 4k45-60 card for quite a long while.The 3080 12G destroys the 1080, which it should. But I was shocked by how often it was destroying it while using less power to run a game. Like in MHW. Or Horizon Zero Dawn. I had to lower settings in HZD to get 4k30 on the regular and my 1080 8G would regularly hit above 200watts. Using max settings with my undervolt, my 3080 12G will regularly benchmark well below 200 watts and be a smooth 4k60 native. At DLSS, it would sit way below, around 150 watts, and have superior AA to boot.This card is amazing. The price is not. I wish I felt like the 40 series would be available to met in 2022, but I do not. I spent two years trying to get a card during shortages, parts shortages, scalpers, and online sites that refused to create queues to help smooth out the frustration. Not me, not again. I'd rather have what I can guarantee I can get now and probably get 4070-like performance with what I assume will be a modest increase in price over that later card but it's in my hands right now with superior memory bandwidth.Hopefully, this helps anyone else. TLDR; card is quiet, has great power limit to help you do whatever you're trying to do, the company has a great warranty and a history of great warranty service, it looks great if you're into staring at your card, it performs well, the 12G of VRAM is handy for future games as we look like we're finally leaving the Xbone behind, DLSS is nice, and, if you're like me and you think you might stream even once on Twitch or Youtube, you probably want NVENC over AMD's alternative because NVENC is way, way, waaaaaaay better at x264 encoding via the GPU than AMD. Look up EpoxVox if you need to and see the difference.Oh, and Ray Tracing is better than the competition, I guess. It's great, but it's easy to forget about it after a few minutes of it being on and you'll often decide whether you want 4k native or DLSS with RT. I often just go DLSS without RT because, for example, a game of Control will go from 400 watts with my undervolt to 200 watts, both using DLSS. That's a lot of power for a small improvement in visuals, isn't it? Control's RT is pretty convenient as a benchmark if your undervolt is going to crash, though.I hope this helps."", 'Excelente grafica a un precio bastente bueno inperdible si tienes la posibilidad', 'Good GPU but noisy fan', ""Last year I built a desktop computer system, 5600X, 32GB RAM, M.2 NVMe, etc. into a large Fractal case.  I had to use an older Radeon Sapphire R9 280 card with 3GB Vram while waiting for the inevitable price drop of video cards.When this model fell to $900 I jumped in and got it.  So glad to have it.  I hear that Nvidia has resumed production of these 12GB models  So I expect that the price will fall even more.Installation was easy and I took my time doing it.  The large case makes the large card look not as imposing compared to trying to put it into a medium case.  Better cooling as well.I added a third power cord so each 8bit connector has its own cord.  I guess it's okay to chain two together so you only need 2 cords in total.  Again, the large case didn't care about extra cords.  My power supply is 850W.The old card automatically set up RDR2 to 1080p with medium settings at best.  The 3080 automatically set RDR2 to the screen's 1440p with Ultra settings for most everything.

I basically had to jam the GPU into its socket because it barely fit. Make sure your dimensions work. once mounted like mine, the card works as usual, just a tight nudge between the case and the card. We now know it’s not broken because it runs very well, so do have the balls to add a bit more force while mounting your card horizontally like I did.In terms of noise, the fans are obviously at 0rpm when the card is idle, my temps are around 47°C. Once I spool up the fans do run but they’re not loud, so the noise level is good.THIS IS IMPORTANT; the card REQUIRES 3, 8 pin  PCIe CONNECTIONS, my PSU only had 2, so I just used the ‘flaccid’ one from one of my 2 cables as my 3rd.

At first, I was concerned that something was wrong because the fans didn’t spin and the RGB lighting didn’t turn on. However, I discovered that the fans do spin up when the card is under a load and the RGB lighting is totally configurable using the Nvidia PrecisionX software (a free app available on Steam or standalone). I also experienced a sudden system shutdown and few times, but discovered it was due to my Power Supply’s overheating protection kicking in. Once I switched off the intelligent thermal control system switch (eliminates fan noise during low to moderate power usage), the shutdowns stopped happening. Overall, I’m very happy with the purchase.', ""This is a great card for 4K gaming. If you game at 1440p i'd go with a 3060ti or 6700xt. If you game at 1080p buy a new monitor/tv before a GPU.The box contents include the graphics card, an EVGA sticker, a generic installation manual not specific to the card, and some kind of support bracket the manual doesn't give instructions on how to use.The performance of all 3080 12gb cards is nearly identical. I choose to go with this one because it is the best looking and had the lowest price ($999.99) i've seen of any 3080 12gb.  There is an EVGA RGB light at the end of the card not shown in any of the stock photos.I have seen noise complaints about this card, I can't compare it to other 3080s but it is 90% quieter than the Gigabyte Nvidia 1080 card it replaced.Most of the negative reviews I looked at seem to be people buying from third party sellers and not amazon, then not understanding this space is for product reviews not seller reviews.

I got the card for myself for my birthday after seeing it being a reasonable price and watching multiple reviews.Pros- Runs any game in 1440p at high settings no problem- Temps stay really low in the 50s to 60s- The UI for AMD is really nice after getting used to it- AMDs video encoder for either streaming or just recording is really good- Amazing performance for the price. Honestly in my opinion the card can be equivalent to a 3080 TI in certain situations without ray tracing- More than enough VRAMCons- The card sometimes has a loud coil whine that can be heard even with headphones on. Not sure if it's just because the card is still brand new and hasn't been broken yet or not.- The card works best for me undervolted slightly. When I first got the card my temps were always very high no matter what game I played. After undervolting a tiny bit my temps went down 20 or 30 degrees.- I love the UI AMD has...but it can be a little annoying trying to find certain things you want.- Since the card is big and heavier than my last one it had a little bit of sagging going on when I installed it. Would definitely recommend either getting an actual bracket or if you want to save some money and don't care how it looks use zip ties.- Not counting this against just AMD, because it happened with my NVIDIA card too. Sometimes when clipping things in games the sound won't be captured even though you have the correct output being used in the software. It's really annoying because I would have friends say or do something funny and I would clip it to watch it later, but it would have no sound.Overall- The card is amazing and definitely worth the investment. Doesn't matter what side you are on when picking a GPU they both have their issues. I personally chose this card mainly for just the price to performance aspect and since I don't really care about ray tracing too much."", 'I ordered the PowerColor Red Dragon RX 6800xt on 9/8/2023 at 2ish pm PST and received the graphics on 9/9/2023 at 6ish am PST. Shipping was extremely fast. Opening the standard Amazon box revealed a PowerColor box that was opened on both ends. When I opened the box to look at the gpu the gpu was not in an anti static bag, there was no pcie cover, and there was no manual/warranty information. Just the gpu in the box. The gpu also smells really weird.Put it in my system and it all seems to work well. The card was not dirty or dusty and the pins on the  board looked new. Opened Starfield and ran the game at ultra 1080p and the fps is pinged at 60fps with and without FSR enabled. I have this card paired with a Ryzen 7 5800X3D.I contacted Amazon support and they offered to refund me some money to keep the gpu which is much appreciated. They also noted that if I unhappy with the partial refund that I could return the gpu which I don\'t plan on doing. All in all good card. Just note that ordering this can result in an ""open box"" or ""used"" gpu.', ""After issues with my initial delivery, I explained to the customer support that I hadn't received my item and they were quick to ship out another and as I had now spoken with the local delivery people and given them instructions on how to get into my building everything went smoothly. Haven't had much chance to test it's legs yet but no display issues swaping from Nvidia so that's a good sign."", ""To start, I only occasionally game with my rig. I mainly use my rig with video and photo editing software. I'll very rarely also use 3D editing software. With my old GPU, the videos I would attempt to edit would require several seconds of loading before I could begin to work on the file. If I skipped to a further part of the video, which is common to do, I would have to wait for more loading. With this card, I no longer have to wait for my preview to load. I can edit immediately and when I frame skip, it's actually in real time. My render times have also been cut down by more than half. As long as you have enough power to feed this card, this card is very impressive! It is also very large. You will want to make sure you have the space in your case."", 'Tras varios meses probando esta grafica puedo decir que es una muy buena opción para jugar a todos lo juegos nuevos a 1440p.Vengo de una Nvidia 970 que hasta hace poco ha funcionado muy bien y ha cumplido a 1080p.

He probado también a 4k y he de decir que se nota mas el procesador, por que no pasa de 30 o 40 fps, pero espero que mejore cuando cambie el resto del ordenador.La única pega que encuentro de momento se encuentra en la gestión de la grafica por el software, la configuración predeterminada de la aplicación de AMD. Ya que si mantienes el voltaje al 100%, tal como viene, cuando juegas a juegos exigentes la gráfica comienza a hacer un ruido horroroso (coil whine), no son los ventiladores, es algún componente de la grafica. La solución que he encontrado es hacer un undervolt, que ciertamente, en los juegos que he probado, no ha afectado en nada a los fps ni al rendimiento, pero no es normal que con la configuración original ocurra eso.Por lo demás una grafica muy recomendable y que por un precio de unos 600€ que me costo a mí, en relación calidad precio, no hay nada mejor.', ""Questa scheda grafica è una bestia non c'è gioco che non regga, parlo del 1980x480 ma assicuratevi di aver una buona areazione all'interno del case, perchè scalda come un motore della vecchia panda in piena estate, ci potete coucere le uova sopra.

With the mining craze dying down, it looks like GPU prices have almost regained sanity, particularly on the AMD side of things.This card is the mid tier model from PowerColor (Red Devil is the upper tier), but it still packs a wallop.  According to some GPU hierarchy charts, the 6800 XT rates up there with a 3090, or 4070 Ti even.  Obviously for ray-tracing Nvidia is still the leader by a far margin.It has a Gaming/OC vs Silent/Cool switch on the card itself to switch between 2 BIOS settings.  This model doesn't have all the RGB options the Red Devil does, only a red illuminated Red Dragon logo.  Fortunately this can be switched off by another physical switch on the card.The fans stay off until ~60oC.  Mine is idling right now at 54oC.  Max temp I've hit under short benchmarks was in the mid 70s.  The fans were fairly quiet.I had read many reviews about coil whine in this particular model.  The rumors are all true!  I didn't hear it with the limited gaming I started with, but after running some benchmarks with extremely high FPS, it became very obvious.  Specifically, several modes on MSI Kombustor brought it out.  (GL) PBR-Donut, for example, gave me 900 fps and a really notable buzz.  The coil whine was easily audible even through my Fractal Design Define R5 case, which is supposed to be great for quiet operation.  For benchmarks with FPS < 200, I didn't really hear anything.I have a Corsair RMX 750, a well regarded PSU.  I had read about using 2 separate PCI-E cords, instead of the standard 1 cord daisy chain (of 2 6+2 connectors), to help reduce coil whine.  Unfortunately it did not eliminate it.  I had also read that with continued use, the coil whine may subside.  Depending on how much usage you put into it, that may not help if you run out the 30 day return window.  This card does come with a 2 year warranty, most other manufacturers have 2 or 3 years.  It's my first PowerColor so we'll see how it does.""]"

That\'s to be expected with a card this strong and with this many watts running through it. There\'s been no coil while and the card I received had black ends and not the infamous red ""clown lips"" as they\'ve been referred to. I would purchase again.

It's just a shame that you have to pay so much more than the manufacturer's price if you want it ASAP.  Since I've bought the card I've noticed that the price has gone up and that tells me I probably would still be waiting as I write this review, if I would've purchased it directly from NVIDIA.  An important fact, this card requires 3 power cables.  Remember that.  I went through some changes to put it mildly until I just went ahead and purchased a EVGA power supply that had all the cables I needed.  I had the card for almost a month before I could use it.  Secondly, its a big card.  I have a midtower case and I got in there but you may have to move some cables around.  Overall it's a monster of a card. Very capable."", ""This gpu was pretty easy to install. However, it was very thick. It takes up 3 pci spaces. Luckily, I don't really use that many, so it wasn't a deal breaker. I am a little worried that it is too heavy for my motherboard. My case can't mount the included support bracket.An important note is that the gpu takes up a lot of power. It kept crashing on my 750 W power supply. It was easy to undervolt in MSI Afterburner which saved about 150 W. I haven't noticed any performance degradation from undervolting, so anyone with power issues should do it. I haven't used any of the overclocking features on this card, but I may in the future.In regard to value for money, it is $109.99 over MSRP, so keep that in mind. For me, this was the only 3080 available, so I was willing to pay that much. For performance, it runs really well.

It's sad for a card of this price.Edit: a couple of months later and the coil whine has reduced significantly."", 'So far this GPU has been great. Love the RGB and how I can customize it. The only issue that I have had, which seems to be affecting some cards, is that my third fan speed throttles up and down at low temps. The other fans stay off or are at low RPMs, but the third fans constantly revs up and down, which is noisy and I feel would cause more wear on it. One thing that helps is setting this card to the OC mode which makes the fan stay at a set speed. Other than the fan issue, which is hopefully something that can be fixed with firmware updates, this is a beast of a card.']"

I have 16 gb or ram.. so 3.8ghz 16gb ram and this video card. I play back for blood ... aka Left for dead 3 on 1920 by 1080 settings and it plays fine, no stutter no issue. If you set the video for anything less than that. the game doesnt play smooth because the processor is old and not fast enough for the game or the video card. So if you have an old system like I do.

You just need to make sure your cpu is also strong enough to not bottleneck your game play as much , so everything will be smooth', 'Reemplace una RX 550 AMD, y la mejora fue grandísima.', ""In simple terms, I am giving this product a 3-star review because it is very much a decent niche version of an otherwise bad GPU.  The 1650 offers bad performance for its price but this low profile card may well be the best possible option (at the present time) for certain use cases like mine.  Objectively, it is not a good video card overall and it is very overpriced for the performance (I spent less than half this much upgrading my son's graphics card to a more powerful model than this).On the other hand, it is absurdly small and that does matter for certain use cases.  It is simply the best option available if you need a TINY video card that can do light gaming.  That's why this card can command the premium price.  That's why I bought it and that is why I feel it deserves an intermediate rating.  It is the best option for some niche cases but awful for most PCs.If you are just looking for an everyday normal-sized budget graphics card to add a few years of life to an older PC, you will be far better served by a GTX 1660 series, the GTX 1650 Super, the RX 500 series or possibly the RX 5500/5600 series (depending one what prices are at when you check - I'm sure Amazon has them all).  You can get a used RX 580 for a fraction of the cost and it will utterly dominate this card.  The 1650 (non-Super) is well known to have poor performance for a modern card.  Avoid them like the plague unless you need a tiny LP model like this.I picked up one of these ZOTAC GTX 1650 LP models as a replacement card for my home theatre PC's dying GT 1030.  I considered just getting another 1030 but the HTPC has been seeing use as a light duty gaming system (essentially acting as another console for the family) so I figured I should bump the gaming horsepower up a bit.In short, the current marketplace for low profile cards is a barren wasteland mostly populated by very old models that cannot even compete with the integrated graphics on a current generation budget AMD chip.  The list of options that fit in my low profile HTPC case was pretty limited:  the 1650 is literally the only current gen low profile option, with the 1030/1050/1050Ti in the previous generation below it and everything is just utterly obsolete for anything but basic 2D output.This model of 1650 is currently about 10 dollars more than the best 1050 Ti low profile option on Amazon (so maybe 4% more in price).  Since the 1650 does have a fair bit more gaming performance (at least 20% more performance) than the 1050 Ti, that made it literally the only sensible choice for my use case.  Your mileage may vary.  If your use case is similar to mine, go for it.  There honestly isn't a competing product on the market if you need a physically tiny card that can play a bit of Fortnite, World of Warships or other light duty titles.  It's a potato video card but at least it's a nice potato.  It's plenty to run 4k video or game in 1080p.  Don't get a 1650 for video encoding since it lacks the Turing video encoder and only has the old Volta encoder (get a 1660 model if you need that feature but those aren't low profile).Regarding HDR:  The hardware has full HDR support but keep in mind that Windows 10 has atrocious HDR support and Nvidia is infamously bad at Linux support so it might be a pain to get a good 4k HDR output due to software headaches.  Expect to run in 4k SDR if you hook this up to a modern TV.  Maybe there's a good Linux distro for an HTPC that would make this sing for HDR HTPC work.  I don't have sufficient Linux expertise to know.As for this particular ZOTAC model versus other ones, I have no comparative opinion on that because I simply haven't found rival models for sale in Canada.The construction of the ZOTAC model appears fairly decent, particularly for a relatively budget card.  I assume the PCB is probably pretty close to a reference low profile model but I have no way to tell for sure.  The cooling solution is a reasonable chunk of aluminum with a fairly small pair of twin fans which are quiet enough to tolerate in a home theatre setup.  There appear to be thermal pads connecting the memory and I think the VRMs to the cooler rather than only connecting the GPU, so that's a nice detail.  The cooling solution thickens the card to two slots in thickness so it is narrow and short but thick.  It is actually shorter and narrower than my old passively cooled ASUS GT 1030 but a touch thicker.  It runs quite a bit cooler thanks to the active cooling too.  The connectors are your basic HDMI, DVI and as a pleasant surprise on a low profile card, a DisplayPort connector.  A low profile backplane is provided so you can swap out the normal sized one for fitting it in a thin PC.  So far, the card has been working without issues after a quick card swap and driver re-installation.  Solid 2D, video playback and acceptable framerates in light gaming.While the 1650 is an underwhelming GPU, this does appear to be a well made and VERY compact 1650 card.  The size is remarkable. It is so small that it actually helped airflow in my cramped HTPC case.  This is not a good solution for everyone but for buyers needing a compact little video card that isn't a total dinosaur, it's the only real option right now.  This card is literally perfect for your needs or a terrible choice, depending on your use case.  There really is no middle ground on this one.Edit: The fans on the little ZOTAC card's cooler get rather noisy when it ramps over 60C.  I would suggest ensuring your case ventilation is decent or if you have a cramped HTPC case, installing a little case fan to draw in fresh air near the card.  This is only noticeable when the card is doing 3D gaming.  It stays quiet and cool for ordinary desktop use and media playback since that is far less demanding on the GPU.  I suppose one could use software like Afterburner to manually adjust the fan curves to keep it quiet but hot but just using a low noise fan to feed cool air seems more sensible."", 'To buy new or upgrade card and memory? Well did a little research to find all kinds of Youtube videos of people taking an old i5-4440 and adding a GTX1650 card and memory so that they could play current titles  in 1080 (apparently the GTX 1650 is a good matchup with the i5-4440 as anything more would result in the CPU bottlenecking). Seeing how my desktop has never had any issues, my monitor is only capable of 1080,  power supply is only 300 watts and this GTX1650 runs at only 75 watts from the Pci express slot I figured that I would give it a shot. Well as luck has it I was able to get an open box version of the GTX 1650 for only $181.00  and 2 sticks of 8GB Ram for $40.00 taxes included (prices took into account a $50 gift card for applying for a Amazon MC). Hmmm spend $1.5K to $2K for new gaming desktop to play newer games in 4K or a whooping $220 to upgrade and continue playing in 1080 on a machine that still appears to have life in it. Yep went with the $220 cause you know when the machine finally does reach its limit the newer 4K systems are just going to get cheaper than what they are currently :)', ""I've been using Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 OC 4GB GDDR6 with 3 monitors: Left: 1920x1080 flipped vertically, middle: 2560x1080, right: 2560x1080 for 20 days now. I noticed that trying to install NVidia driver 470 would result in unmet dependencies error: sudo apt install nvidia-driver-470; I installed driver 515 and it has caused Youtube and Netflix video on Chrome 105.0.5195.125 to lag or pause for 0.5 second every 10 seconds. Also lagged on Firefox. It's frustrating as audio does not lag or pause. I install driver 520 and rebooted. So far the lagging does not happen. I had to disable hardware acceleration in Chrome;otherwise, Chrome would freeze up once every 3 days. However, the open source Chromium does not freeze up with hardware acceleration turned on.I also noticed that clicking on the Chrome tabs would become unresponsive after leaving the logon session on for over 2 weeks. A quick fix is to kill gnome-shell process which makes the desktop shell disappear for 5 seconds and re-appear. Those are the things to be cared for if you intend to use it for 3 monitors on Ubuntu >= 22.04."", ""Quck Summary:  Don't expect to handle all games at high settings, but for the price it has very good performance and works with 300w power supply without additional graphics power.  I would highly recommend over Radeon RX 550 or GeForce GTX 1050 Ti OC.Reason for Purchase:  Upgrade old PC with onboard graphics to be able to play games. The main concern was that the power supply was able to handle powering the card.  Since it did not come with added GPU power I opted for a low power card to save on upgrading the power supply also.PC Specs: - Asus VivoPC K31CD - 8GB DDR4-2400 - CPU Gen 7 i5 quad core 3Ghz - Power Supply: 300 Watt (No graphics card power available, Needed to be powered by the PCI-E bus)Purchased: This graphics card and 32GB (Max) DDR-4I was planning on getting the Radeon RX 550 at first or the GTX 1050 Ti OC because this was an old under-powered PC and I wanted the most bang for the buck.  My newest MacBook Pro has the 550 in it and it handles my steam games good, but struggled on Quern at high res (21 FPS).  So I was leaning toward the 1050 Ti when I came across this beauty.  It claims to be 50% more powerful than the 1050 and it was actually cheaper so I went for it.It had no issues with power and handles Quern at 60-70 FPS.  This was my benchmark since the 550 seemed to start choking around that.  Also tried Factorio, Skyrim, Borderlands, and BioShock Infinity.  All older games but it handled them all wonderfully.  Very successful upgrade."", 'First, to everybody saying that this card is ""loud,"" I disagree. Maybe you got a bad one? Mine is super quiet. Second, if you\'re like me, and you just bought a new 2022 HP or a Dell (in my case the HP Pavilion Desktop PC TP01-2000i) with tons of RAM and a super-fast 11th gen Intel processor and an SSD and were very excited until you popped the hood and realized that the power supply (PSU) is proprietary, has no available power cables, and doesn\'t pack enough power to run your dedicated video card even if it did, this is your ONLY cost-efficient solution. The Intel 750 UHD that came with my new HP computer is awful. I score in the mid 20th percentile on 2D and 3D tests using Performance Test 10.1 even with the 11th gen processor and 64GB of RAM. I need a dedicated GPU for video editing, and the Zotac is one of a few reasonable solutions because it\'s compact and fits in the small space available (see photo) and does NOT require external power. It works great with the 310-watt PSU in my HP even though it says it requires around 375 watts. Not a problem. Best part is that I\'m now getting close to the 60th percentile on 2D and 3D tests using Performance Test, which is a massive upgrade over the integrated Intel UHD 750. I don\'t game hardly at all, but according to ""Can I Run It?"", I could, if I wanted to, play 96 out of the top 100 games. With 4GB of fast onboard RAM, I\'ll be able to do what I need to do in the way of video editing. What a relief. I should have done more research on the computer I bought it, but at least I can do what I need to do now.']"

Bought 3 of this and yes it works too.', ""I recently upgraded my gaming rig with the ZOTAC Gaming GeForce GTX 1660 6GB GDDR5 graphics card, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. This card delivers an impressive performance at an affordable price point, making it a fantastic option for gamers on a budget.First and foremost, the GTX 1660 shines when it comes to gaming. It handles the latest titles with ease, providing smooth and immersive gameplay experiences. I've been able to play games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Assassin's Creed Valhalla at 1080p resolution with high settings, and the performance has been outstanding. The visuals are crisp, and the frame rates are consistently high, making for a truly enjoyable gaming experience.The 6GB of GDDR5 memory is more than sufficient for most gaming needs. It allows for quick and seamless rendering of graphics, ensuring smooth transitions and preventing any noticeable lag or stuttering. The card's power efficiency is also commendable, as it doesn't consume excessive energy, keeping temperatures and noise levels in check.Installation was a breeze. The card fit perfectly into my system, and the accompanying software made it easy to optimize the settings for my specific needs. The compact size of the card is another plus, as it fits well in a variety of PC cases without any clearance issues.Additionally, the GTX 1660 offers excellent value for the price. Compared to higher-end graphics cards, it delivers a substantial performance boost without breaking the bank. For gamers who don't require 4K gaming or the latest ray tracing capabilities, this card is a smart investment.The ZOTAC Gaming GeForce GTX 1660 6GB GDDR5 is not just limited to gaming; it can handle content creation tasks with relative ease. Video editing, 3D modeling, and rendering benefit from the card's powerful capabilities, making it a versatile option for creative professionals as well."", ""This 1660 is an excellent 2nd card if you just want to add more monitors, but don't want to pay as much as you did for your first card. To be clear, I don't game, I don't render video, I just trade stocks on this PC. I already had 4 monitors, but between utilizing multiple timeframes on the same ticker to make decisions, multiple order entry boxes(Level II), time and sale (tape) and then the desire to have more windows from my scanners up and more tickers to just be able to watch outside of the ones I'm already in, I felt I'd need to add a couple more monitors. Right now I'm only running 1 more hdmi out to a TV and I have a scanner running on it full screen, which works great, as opposed to what I was doing before, which was minimizing a browser which would block one of my trading screens when I pulled it back up. I thought when I first started trading that 2-3 monitors would be all I'd need. I could not have been more naive. Every bit of information you could possibly have, I'm willing to take. I'm a bit annoyed that I asked on here whether I could add another card. I actually got responses saying they didn't think so, meanwhile I KNOW I've seen other traders with 6-8 monitors, and having already a 3060ti in my build, I know in Zotac's Firestorm I've seen where the software allows you to click between up to 4 graphics cards in order to overclock them differently. So despite the responses received and using some logic to determine this was ok, I decided to go ahead and buy the 1660 and figured I'd return it if it didn't work out. I'm glad I did. My bequiet PSU actually had another set of 8pin outs that I wasn't using. My 3060ti was only using one, so I was able to use the other for the 1660. Worked like a charm! When I booted up my computer after install, it did take a little longer to boot up, but once I got home screen, I opened up Nvidia settings, I went straight to 'setup multiple monitors' and just fiddled around with things and I must say, nice and smooth. The 1660 is not as bad as I thought it would be. Actually almost just as clear, but the 3060ti is clearly a few notches above. It's just smoother and snappier. You can tell this with just the mouse movement alone and how it feels in your hand. This is partly bc my first pci slot is getting pci 4.0 and the 1660's pci slot is only able to offer 3.0 come to find out. All in all the 1660 was not intended to be some high definition card in the first place. At least not for my build. Overall, I'm happy.So now I'm running:AsRock x570 Taichi Razer EditionRyzen 9 5900x overclocked to 4.4ghz at 1.25vNoctua Nh-U12a CPU CoolerCorsair Vengeance LPX 32x2 3800mhz cl18 (I could not get even 3600mhz using 4x16, which is what I really wanted bc it looks better imo)Zotac RTX 3060ti (you do not need more than this for trading)Zotac GTX 1660BeQuiet Straight Power 850w Platinum PSU (I'm pulling about 265w total with both cards in, but that's with only 1 hdmi out being used on this new graphics card.

From being barely able to play minecraft, i can now play at max settings. Gta 5 maxed out on ultra at 1080p is reaching over 90fps. All other games like peoject cars, asseto corasa, just cause 3, mafia 2, etc... plays 60fps no problem at 4k resolution.

Easy installation, card is very quiet and functions flawlessly!', 'Great', 'I upgraded from an old 2gb gpu to thus and OMG.I can play pretty everything in ultra def depending which games.I usually play for WoW  , NMS, GW2, Cyberpunk and all works well in ultra settings.I also have a ryzen 7 3700x and 32gb ram and nvme samsung 1t ssd.This is the cheapest and most powerful gpu you can get on the market right trust me.', 'I needed a decent card to drive my 27” 4K display on my Ubuntu Linux system while working from home that would also give me decent FPS in Steam (and would be delivered in a reasonable amount of time). Against my better judgement, I’d tried a Radeon-based card beforehand and it was an incompatible nightmare.There are cheaper cards out there, but the ZOTAK had the GPU I wanted and a lot more RAM than some of the other options.Installation was overall pretty simple. Pull the old card, drop in the new one and hook up the PCIE power cable. I highly recommend that you use at least a 650 or 750 watt supply. I had a Corsair 750 watt supply on my parts shelf that I installed at the same time and when I fired the system up, I was impressed that I didn’t hear a lot of fan noise.I like to use the official Nvidia drivers since they usually have better management utilities and better performance. After setting the system to use the “multi-user.target”, I followed their installation procedure to blacklist the nouveau kernel modules and installed their drivers.After rebooting, the system went back to the default “graphical.target” and things just worked from there on.I did some testing with Kerbel on Steam and the display was crisp, clean and had a decent frame rate. I didn’t notice any extra fan noise and verified that the card continued to run cool. The two large fans do a nice job moving air while making minimal noise.Overall, I’m pretty impressed with the card. It gives a reasonable balance between price and performance and has been trouble free so far..']"

Probably won\'t be able to handle some of the newer games unless you setup custom profiles in Catalyst.- Handles rendering and intense GPU processing well.  Tested with ptGui and AutoCADD so far.  Got pretty good results, pretty quick.- Came with ATX case bracket, HDMI to DVI-D converter and drivers / ATI Catalyst software and instructions.- Rates at a 6.9 / 7.9 on Win7-64 with Phenom II X6 1065t CPU.CONS:- NOISY.  Before I upgraded the video card I had about 17 - 20dB of noise from my system at idle.  Now it\'s about 35dB - 38dB at idle.  At 100% CPU usage it\'s about 55 - 60dB with case & CPU fan at full throttle with all case covers on.  Pretty noisy.- HOT.  Hot to the touch.  Granted you shouldn\'t be ""touching"" the heat sinks on your GPU card but even from an overnight OFF state to on, it gets hot quickly.  Less than two minutes.I\'m being generous with the four star here because the heat and noise is almost a deal breaker. Hot and noisy just isn\'t a good combination for any type of electronics unless it\'s a device that is expected to produce heat and noise.  The card itself works great though.For the cooling benefits, a fan is a good thing to have on your GPU.  For the noise, eh, not so much - especially the fan on this card.  Might want to go with a silent card that just has larger heat sinks and hope your case fan (if you have one) keeps your system cool enough or replace the fan with a liquid cooler for GPU cards (if you have the space).', ""Bought this for use with three displays. It is not compatible with UEFI systems unless you disable Secure Boot and enable Legacy ROM support in UEFI BIOS before you install it. Installed in a Dell Inspiron 560 and a Dell Inspiron 3847 system. Worked fine until I thought I would try to flash it with UEFI GOP support. Don’t do that. You'll brick it if you do. If you need Secure Boot, look elsewhere. If you don't, then this was a decent card for the money. Drove all three displays on Windows 10 (while it lasted) with decent performance.  Not meant for high-end gaming. Works best with clean installations of drivers. Requires an active adapter (not included) to use the DisplayPort at the same time as two HDMI displays.  Otherwise you'll only get two working displays.* Updated - I was able to re-flash the card with the original spec vBIOS ROM and it came back to life and works again.  So, still working fine, even after a bad flash!"", 'I run a business from home and over the years I e acquired a few obsolete TVs I no longer need for the rest of my house so naturally they became my computer monitors. All I really wanted to do was to be able to have two different TVs - sorry, monitors. Going at the same time. One to have going while I track my workers and the other to use while working from home. I just got tired of switching from like 6 or 7 different tabs all the time. The only reason I gave it a 4 star rather then a 5 star is the fan. If you are in complete silence yes it’s kinda annoying. But for me at night all I do is put computer to sleep and little fan goes quite.', ""The one shown in the picture is not the one that was shipped to me although I am not complaining because the one I was shipped  (an AMD Radeon HD 7700 Series) met and exceeded my expectations. Additionally, this card is for the HP Small Form Factor workstations in the Z200 series.The difference between what is shown in the image with this product and what I received is that the GFX card has two (non-standard  [see image]) HDMI jacks although my new monitor (being an HP VH240a) came with the necessary cables. So this card is running a desktop with two monitors and it does it rapidly and seamlessly. I don't know whether or not it would be satisfactory for someone who is an intense gamer but for a computer engineer it is an elegant card with a very nice Dashboard for fine tuning both monitors (the second is an HP w2408h which is almost 10 years old) and this card is a major improvement over the motherboard's GPU. When I installed this card the older monitor's GFX definition was dramatically improved.I am very happy with this card which I've been using since June 2019 and have no reservations in recommending this to other computer engineers or users who know how to install a card and use the CD to install the drivers, who want a very nice GFX card."", ""Bought this card for my husbands work from home pc so that he can connect two monitors. Card kept crashing his brand new windows 11 pc. Card is not worth its value. Return has also been a hassel, as Amazon's third party delivery company never wants to show up to pick up the card."", 'Pros - Easy enough to install.  Not too expensive, and it has 2 HDMI outputs.  Drivers updated quickly.  Colors so much better on my 4 year old Dell 22"" monitors.  Cons - I can\'t do anything else on the PC if I want to do any gaming.  I usually listen to some music or YouTube videos while playing FPS games online.  The card is not up to that.  I guess I needed way more VRAM than 1 GB.  Looks like I don\'t have a lot of options for a SFF machine, so that is my own issue, not an issue with the card.  I would return but I was overly optimistic and tossed the packaging.  At least it was open box so it was under $50.', 'merci', 'Works as expected except the fan is louder than you would expect, maybe due to the arrangement of the cooling fins. If you’re in a quiet space/office, alone, it might be a slight irritant that you have to get used to. Would have preferred a “silent” video card if I knew this ahead of time (I’m not a gamer, using this to upgrade for 3D design work).', 'I bought this as a low cost dual HDMI output graphics card for an older Intel I7 machine running an ASUS ROG motherboard in an old and noisy server tower, that supposedly had multi monitor support on it\'s on board card, but never seemed capable of actually doing.  I run mine in a mirror mode to pipe video and audio into my living room for streaming movies.  It\'s doing exactly as I need it to do, and I\'m a happy customer.  I don\'t think I\'d look to this card for gaming.  There are far better choices for the hardcore gamer.  Both of my ""monitors"" are large UHD 4k TV\'s, and I have no flicker issues, even with the second one running on a 50 foot HDMI cable.  A great buy for someone needing an inexpensive card and multi monitor support.', 'Runs great!  But noisy as hell I wish this could be cooled passively.

I gave up on a 4090 due to the outrageous prices; a 4080 seemed like a good compromise between price and performance. Ran the Unigine 2 benchmark at 1080p setting and it achieved a top 300 score without breaking a sweat. See photos. Temperature never exceeded 65C and the fans never got past 40% during the test. That’s astonishing for what’s supposed to be a “bargain” RTX 4080. I also love the fact that this card isn’t laughably huge like most other 4080’s; this thing slipped easily into my mid-ATX chassis with no problem at all. Oh, I almost forgot, this card is downright quiet compared to every other graphics card I’ve ever owned. I had to use my Craftsman inspection mirror to look at the fans to confirm that they were spinning because I could not hear any fan noise even with the card under full load. Performance is outstanding and easily beats my Gigabyte 3080 Vision OC by 40-50%. My MSI 4080 Ventus clocked up to 2835 MHz right out of the box; I haven’t even bothered to overclock it yet because frankly there’s no reason to do so. I certainly don’t need any more performance from it. So far I’ve played Fallout 4 (heavily modded) and some Meta Quest 2 VR games and this card just tore through them all. I also love the look of this card; it’s far better looking than most other 4080s imho even without RGB. If you’re still on the fence about buying a 4080, I strongly recommend that you consider this MSI 4080 Ventus 3X OC. It’s a strong performer, it’s cheaper than most other 4080s, it runs quiet and cool, and it doesn’t look gaudy or ridiculous like most other RTX 4080 cards do. And it’s likely one of the few 4080s that will actually fit in your case without the need for major hacksaw surgery lol.', 'Un diseño bastante clean, desde mi punto de vista mejoraria el soporte que trae.', 'Card is very quiet and runs cool as even this ""budget"" cooler is oversized for the card.

I've noticed that other cards from other manufactures have a little bit more of a higher clock but this still gets the job done. Now for the 2 issues I have. 1st thing is their Proprietary Software (Firestorm) that YOU MUST use to change the RGB and it's super Glitchy and not very user friendly It's a big pain to use and you can't use any other software to change the RGB like other GPUs let you do in the market. Now 2nd issue I have is Quality Control! I've been looking around Reddit and other review forms and it seems this card and some of other Zotac cards have a little bit of quality control issues with fans and no Surprise... RGB as well. And in fact I fell victim to RGB issues on my GPU Holder (As shown in the Video) Now it does seem like they source the RGB Holder from another Manufacture and they just print Zotacs Label on it but still not okay!!!Update 8/19/2023: I seem to also now have feel victim of the fan noise ball bearings issue this GPU makes.Overall this card is very good and I'm Going to keep it for a very long while!

I saved at the time of purchase over 500 dollars. This card handles pretty much any game I throw at it with ease.', 'It’s big! Make sure it fits your case before purchasing. It comes with a kickstand for the GPU that is more like a “support rod” that fits in the slot below the card and keeps it propped up. Overall the fit in my case was perfect but I have a X Large ATX tower from NZXT.I have an i7-8700k (bottleneck) and with this card everything is maxed out at either 1080p or 1480p. Haven’t jumped on the 4K bandwagon yet. I mainly got the 3090 for VR - which I am so glad I did. I use airplay with the quest 2 to PC VR and this piece of hardware was the best thing I’ve ever done. My latency in every game is phenomenal and I’m not dropping frames.', ""Avis un peu biaisé parce que je passe d'une MSI RTX 1070 à une Zotac RTX 3090 ti mais c'est vraiment une excellente CG.Tout est vraiment impeccable que ce soit la boîte, la qualité du produit et le rendu graphique sur le PC.Le prix était en plus super attractif!Je recommande."", ""As far as the GPU chip itself, it's monstrously powerful but not economical (no surprise).The zotac software has issues with its RGB lighting and the fans on the shroud are subpar. I actually took off the shroud and am cooling it with two large case fans and hitting better temperature marks at less noise.To be fair, I have also done some tweaking in afterburner. Mostly lowering the voltage has had probably a bigger impact as three power cables are certainly overkill."", ""I've owned it for about a month now and I have no complaints from a performance standpoint. It was expensive and frankly overpriced but I play flight simulators like DCS World and MSFS 2020 on high settings and vr and those type of games require the best of the best to get everything to run smooth, I have a flight sim cockpit I have built so it has a bunch of display monitors and dozens of applications running in sync with one another, for me, it was the only viable option for my standards. The fan sound is loud if running full blast but I typically wear headphones anyways. One thing does bother me, there is something weird that I believe to be a bug in the drivers (this is a problem with other new nvidia cards so I don't think it's Zotacs fault) where if I don't turn the power settings in Nvidia control panel to Optimal instead of Prefer maximum performance AND run MSI afterburner all the time then my computer idles at 50 to 60c which is nuts. As soon as i turn on msi afterburner it goes back down to 29c. This is a ugly bug that Nvidia needs to figure out and causes my card to throttle all the way up to 1800 mhz just doing nothing. Didn't ever have this issue with my 2080 super. This card is for a niche crowd only and can't recommend unless you got some passionate hobby that really drives you to buy one, so if you really need good stable frames for something like flight simming and already have a great computer it's ok."", 'I was able to get this card for $900 firming an Amazon flash sale, and at that price, it’s a spectacular card. I have had zero issues with it so far and actually seems to be performing above expectations.I can’t say much on the stock cooling or lighting features since I’ve removed the stock cooling for a water block.Pretty sure this is the biggest gpu in existence, probably the only complaint I have haha.

When i recieved the box it felt too light compared to my old one that i ordered from nvidia. While i opened the amazon box i noticed the gpu box seal was broken, so i only got an empty box with nothing inside... so someone from their packaging area stole it. Got refund but now i couldnt order it again since they have a buying limit and they counted that as me buying it...', ""Not much to say. It's the hummer of GPUs. Takes a lot of power, eats a ton of space, weighs way too much. I've recently sold it locally to someone else, but when I went to put in a different GPU, I came to find a bunch of pins in the PCI-E slot absolutely smooshed and angled too widely for the new GPU to actually connect everything properly unless I used something to force it to angle down.Yeah, screw that.So I'm left with the use of another PCI-E slot, which isn't exactly a detriment, but my point stands. It's heavy enough to physically damage a motherboard in under four months.""]"

As an avid gamer, I was eager to put this powerful GPU to the test, and I must say it surpassed all my expectations.First and foremost, the performance of the RTX 3060 XC Gaming is simply exceptional. Equipped with NVIDIA's Ampere architecture, this card delivers a significant boost in frame rates and graphical fidelity compared to its predecessors. Whether I was exploring vast open worlds or engaging in intense multiplayer battles, the smoothness and visual detail were unparalleled."", 'Last of the EVGA consumer cards. Has a firmware issue with fans spinning on and off with a creaking noise. Had to turn them to 40% to correct it. EVGA knows About it, but does nothing to correct it. Not loud, have had no other issues with the card.', 'I spend very little on my PC.  In 2015, I built my I5 5820K, 32gb, GTX 770 OC and it has chugged through every task I ask of it at the lowest of graphic settings.  I wasn\'t aware of how used to 15-25fps I was until I upgraded with this GPU.  I checked the prices a couple of years ago and laughed as I walked away.  ""I built my computer for nearly that much.""  I thought.A couple of weeks ago, when I bought this unit, the price was well under MSRP.  Now it seems that the price is up by at least 25%.  This is a very functional GPU and in my case, was a tremendous upgrade from my previous card.  However, new buyers should be wary of the fluctuating prices and not pay much, if any over the product\'s MSRP.As for the performance:  This newfound power of double-digit frames per second allowed me to play with the settings on multiple games and see the resulting clarity.  I demand a great deal when it comes to multitasking with my GPU.  I will certainly have fifty windows of Chrome and two of Excel open while any game is running.  Very seldom do I get to JUST game.  That being said, I still get 18-25 fps on GTA5 on max settings, but I found a mix of ultra and very high settings that give me 55+fps in 4K windowed mode.  If these programs take too long to minimize, I also downgrade graphics and this was a good combo.  Tiny Tina\'s Wonderland gave 25-35fps on max settings, but low texture quality and ultra texture rendering cranked that up to 55+fps.  The ""low quality"" textures still allow you to see splinters in wooden armor as long as they load in quickly.Anyone seeing these numbers would say the same thing:  ""You\'re limited by your CPU""  This is absolutely true, but I assume many people out there were looking for a good card to maximize their current CPU.  If you\'re building new, then you\'ll see far better numbers than myself just because you\'ll likely have a much more powerful CPU.  For now, at least I can easily max out my 4K 60hz while not changing anything else about my machine or habits.At the time (and price) of purchase, this was a great upgrade to my older PC.', 'The media could not be loaded.', ""I bought this when It was around 400 I'm sure the price has gone up and down like crazy but it's worth waiting I've been all types of high demanding games like GTA, cyberpunk, rust, and r6 and it's works like a dream with all of them"", 'I built two gaming pc’s with this graphics card and it never disappoints every time . If you want a cheat build with great graphics I would recommend this 3060. It’s definitely a 10/10', 'Great product and easy to install. Highly recommend.', ""Ordered the GPU during a sale/warehouse deal or whatever.  Nowhere on anything did it say it was used I checked multiple times, looked all over the page for the specs and everything else.Received it and immediately noticed the box had been opened. Original box at least.  Packaging in the box seems to have nothing else in it besides the GPU.  No dust or anything on it as far as I can see.  2 small scratches on the back plate though.  Am extremely Unhappy i was deceived into buying a used product and as a whole I'm getting sick of amazon scamming me.  Nearly every damn item I've bought off here has either been used when it was meant to be new, Used and in worse condition than stated or outright scam item (putting wrong item in box and labeling it as something else).  I'm getting sick of it.Regardless I'm going to swap the GPU out for my current one and run it at 100% for a few days.  If it seems to be okay I may keep it. We'll see. I'll update my review and rating as it progresses.Update 1:  Got it installed.  Some minor issues ( not due to the product)  Seems to be running okay.  Going to proceed to stress test it for a while. Updating star rating to 3 for now."", ""So if you are like me and was waiting for a LONG time for prices to finally start declining on graphics cards, looking to upgrade -  I bought this card at $530 in April 2022. I was upgrading from a GeForce GTX 1050 TI and I can honestly say I noticed an immediate improvement (obviously). The 12GB RAM is what I was looking for specifically in order to run more demanding newer titles like Cyberpunk. My old card was barely able to run Cyberpunk even on low settings - with the 3060 no problems at all even on Ultra. The 3060 is a bit more noisy than the older one as far as the fans go, but otherwise no complaints so far. The installation was super simple, nearly plug and play, and as long as you have a previous NVIDIA card and have GeForce Experience up to date, should be just as easy. The ONLY thing I can warn you about is that you need an 8 pin power connector cable available - so if you don't have one from your power supply, plan for getting one. Lastly, if this card falls within your price range and are interested I would say go for it until more advanced cards lower in price as well over time. The card shipped quicker than it was initially estimated and arrived in perfect condition. Overall a great product so far. 10/10"", ""I recently built my wife a PC of her own and gave her my NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1080 TI. I bought the EVGA RTX 3060 XC card with the idea of slightly upgrading my own PC in mind. I am aware that a GTX 1080 TI and an RTX 3060 XC are very similar in performance but I feel like multiple generations of GPUs should not have similar costs for the same level of performance. The cost of similar performance over 3 generations of GPUs should go down... I paid around 750 USD for my 1080TI in 2018, and for roughly the same performance with RTX added in I paid about the same for my 3060 XC. Overall it runs and plays games about the same as my 1080 TI but it is considerably louder when running a graphically demanding game than my previous card. I did some research and found that they claim it has about 10 points lower of a decibel rating than my previous card but that does not seem to be true at all. All around it's not a bad card I just feel like I paid too much and that it doesn't run as efficiently as my previous one. Final note: I have only really played Red Dead Redemption 2 online since buying this card and it tends to run about 70-80 celsius and uses 95% of the GPU core when running. I get around 65 FPS running most settings on high.""]"

Because at the price point and feature set when I purchased it (Early September '23) it was the best current and future gaming card for my budget for a 1080P gamer looking to eventually move up to 1440 or higher without breaking the bank. The AMD equivalent for the current gen came out right around when I purchased it, but DLSS and RT cores will give it a significantly longer lifespan, so I have no regrets.  Should I have waited a month?  Probably, but I needed a GPU at the time.Why MSI? It has been over 15 years since I built my last PC, and there have been a few solid and consistent brands. MSI has always been there on price and performance, and since I was already going with an MSI motherboard, I figured I'd match them.  I wanted a 3 fan GPU as well for noise as well as possible overclocking reasons.  I also liked this card's lack of RGB.The results?  This card has been impressive, and made me rethink what I wanted to do with the card.  Stock, it performs well, near an average 4070 (Well within margin of error), perhaps slightly better due to it's very modest overclock.  But what impressed me more was the temperatures, being able to run torture tests and struggle to get the card over 60C. The 4070 is an incredibly efficient GPU, and there's still room on the table.  I was able to mostly stably OC it at +225 MHZ and around +1500 HMZ on the ram, but I found I got nearly identical performance at +150 and +1000 respectively.  Tempuratures nearly identical, with maybe the chip getting up to 62 or 63 on the extreme end of the OC, with them going down to 61ish for the OC I settled on. However, the performance improvement was not particularly large, maybe 3-5%.  So, instead, I decided to try undervolting the GPU.  I was able to run the GPU very stably undervolted around .05v at around +100ish core speed and +1000 on the memory, while reducing the tempuratures slightly, and almost entirely avoiding the max power draw of the card (which is 200w in this single connector model).  I could probably do a more agressively undervolt the card at more stock speeds and cut the draw to about 150W under torture loads if I wanted to.  Now, thermals are still around 60C here, but the reduced wattage under load keeps the chip better longer, and puts less wear on other components.Now, with all that OC testing out of the way, this GPU even at stock or underclocked speeds chews though anything I throw at it.  It's currently overkill for 1080P, but it tests well even at 1440P.  The fact that the fans rarely ramp up over 30% speed also means this is ultra quiet, which fits great in my ultra-quiet case.  Given I don't need the extra overlocking speed, I'll save on power draw for now and enjoy a great card.Note, with the good power draw, this card is great in smaller or more restrictive cases as well, as it should still keep cool.  Just keep in mind, it's not the gamer 215W version of the card.  You might be able to squeeze a bit more performance out of that one, but I still think there's no need.  Enjoy the quiet and power efficient performance, it's an amazing card."", '発売前から微妙と言われまったく売れてないと噂のRTX4070。価格・ゲーム性能がほとんど同じRTX3080とよく比較されますが、ネット上の評価は芳しくありません。実際のところ、どうなのか。4Kゲームだけは3080に及んでいませんが、それだけです。4Kゲーム以外のほぼすべて（ゲームに限らない）は3080と同等以上であり、トータルでいえば4070が勝っています。4070のネットでの評価が低いのは、性能云々というよりも結局のところ「10万円とか高すぎじゃね？（70番台で）」という心理的な面が大きく、そのネガティブイメージに引っ張られすぎているようにも見えます。しかし逆に言えば、価格さえ下がればネガティブ面はなくなるとも言えます。確かに定価の10万円は高いと思うし、定価で買う価値があるかどうかは人それぞれですが、値下げやセールで税込み8万円台なら十分に買いだと思います。何故なら、前世代の3070が（グラボ価格高騰期間を除いて）おおむね税込み8万円台だったからです。4070も税込み8万円台で買えるなら『3070と同じ価格帯』といえるので、そうした視点で見るならまた印象も変わるのではないでしょうか。（追記：2023年9月現在、2連ファンモデルはもう8万円台で買えますね）--------------------以下、細かい具体的なこと。ゲーム性能はFHDとWQHDでは3080と互角だけど、4Kだと3080に僅かに及ばない。これが3080との比較でよくマイナス点に挙げられます。ただ逆にいえば、まだまだ多数のFHD環境やWQHD環境の人にとってはまったく意味のない話です。また、4070だと4Kツラいけど3080なら楽勝…というわけでもなく、五十歩百歩で似たようなものです。それに、メジャータイトルはDLSS3に積極的に対応していっているので、話題のゲームだとDLSS3が使える4070が勝つ、それも僅かな差ではなく圧勝というパターンも多いんじゃないでしょうか。それにそもそも論として、重量級ゲームをグラフィック最高設定で高fps張り付きでプレイしたい…っていうのでなければ、4070でも4Kで普通に遊べます。以上はゲーム性能だけの話ですが、ゲーム性能以外にもポイントはあり、中でも特筆すべきは200Wという消費電力の低さだと思います。3080が320W、3070でも220Wなので、4070の消費電力の低さが際立ちます。個人的に、消費電量が低いことのメリットは電源ユニットやワッパ云々というよりも、「高熱にならない」ということに尽きると思ってます。「高熱にならない」とは「パソコンから熱気が出ず、結果的にファンも回らないので静かである」ということであり、つまり「パソコンのすぐ隣にいても快適に過ごせる」ということです。エアコンをガンガンに回してればあまり関係ないかもしれませんが、エアコンはほどほどにしつつ快適に過ごしたいと思ったら、この点はすごく大きいです。（電気代的な意味でも）ちなみに3連ファンモデルを使用している私の環境（WQHDモニター、PCケースはNZXT H5 Flow、エアフローはそれなりに意識してる）では、夏に室温30℃以上になってもアイドル時のGPU温度は50℃以下。比較的に重くないゲームなら50℃台を維持できていて、低温時にはファンが回らない仕様なのでほぼ無音。意図的に高負荷をかけ続けても70℃に達することはありませんでした。また、AV1エンコード対応も、動画投稿や配信をする人にとっては大きなポイントです。動画投稿や配信などは今後AV1が主流になっていく流れですし、H.264はもちろんH.265と比較しても同等画質を維持したまま圧倒的にビットレートを下げることができるAV1を使えるかどうかは、特に長時間録画や高画質配信をしたい人にとってとても大きいと思います。PCでゲームしかしない人（グラボが頑張る場面がゲームだけ）がゲームのfpsだけを見てRTX3000シリーズから買い換える…という限定的な視点でみると、まぁ確かに価格的にも微妙だと思います。ですがRTX2000シリーズやGTXシリーズからの買い替え、最低でも4年か5年くらいは使うつもり、ゲームだけではない総合的な性能や快適さを求める人やクリエイティブ系の作業をする人は、ネットの低評価は無視してよいと思います。--------------------余談ですが、4070tiとの比較で「4070tiがコスパよすぎて4070は価値がない」みたいな言葉をよく見かけますが、それって「400万円の車のほうがコスパいいから300万円の車は価値がない」って言ってるのと同じようなものだと思います。それぞれの予算・求める性能で満足できるほうを選択すればいいだけでしょう。', ""RE:  MSI RTX 4070 Ventus 3x 12g OC  To begin, this is one incredible card, reading some of the comments it appears it’s a little misunderstood by some.  The idea behind this model (light with might) is to minimize psu connection efforts using a standard 8 pin (PCIE) connector (which is all you really need) and to keep it as light as possible to curtail the need for additional support, they did great job it’s only 4oz heavier than my 3060 ti Ventus 2x, the back plate is constructed of a light vinyl composite that’s strong enough to protect it and prevent it from sagging.  The MSI RTX 4070 Ventus 3x 12g OC is approximately 50% faster than the 3060 ti but that doesn’t begin to tell the story.  The 4070 is 80+% faster at image rendering, FPS is up significantly which varies per game and each game setup, for instance with Doom Eternal set at FHD with all other settings being equal the increase was approximately 100 FPS.  The efficiency of this gpu cannot be overstated, using Doom Eternal again, the 3060 ti under an average heavy load (master levels on nightmare); Temps: 70-75C, Power: 185-200W, the 4070 wouldn’t break a sweat; Temps: 55-65C, Power: 155-165W while enjoying a 100 FPS increase, these are average values with fluctuations expected.  The MSI RTX 4070 Ventus 3x 12g OC is virtually silent, really, I haven't heard a single sound from this card.  I’m on my second driver (531.79) with no issues to report.  Performance-wise it’s on track with the RTX 3080 maybe edging it a bit and will do this using 38% less power.  Supported resolutions include FHD, QHD and 4K, this card shines at FHD and QHD.  DLSS 3.0 including frame generation is a game changer, there are 35+ supported games (for DLSS 3.0), and the list is growing.  Ray tracing is improved for this series (game specific) in unison with DLSS 3.0.  The dimensions of this card are 308 x 120 x 43 mm (12.12” X 4.72” x 1.69”) if your case is too small MSI makes a smaller version MSI RTX 4070 Ventus 2x 12g OC with the same power.  If your current setup (gpu ) uses an 8 pin (PICE) connection and it meets the psu minimum requirements (650W) it will only take a few minutes to install this card."", ""Okay so there's a lot of controversy around this card for it's price point, and that's a valid response to Nvidia's pricing in the current GPU landscape. Dropping this card down $50 at the very least would make sense. However this is the market right now and if you're building a new rig, this card starts to make sense. If you're upgrading from a 3080 or 3080ti it might not(except for Frame Generation). Having said that though, this card definitely delivers, since I've upgraded from a 3060 desktop variant.Pros: The card is fast and if you're into ray tracing(I am), it won't let you down(with DLSS 3 enabled anyway) Also to kick those extra frames with RT enabled, Frame Generation is a great feature as well. For visual enthusiasts this card won't leave you thirsting even with 4k gaming. 12gb of Vram is plenty at least at the moment for any game. I currently play at 1440p high settings, ultra is just frame waste in my personal opinion. The visual fidelity just isn't any better to me. This card runs cool, and it's even under the TDP of a 3060. Yes it only has 192bit memory bandwidth but that doesn't impact how the card performs with all the tech onboard. It's a beast for an entry level, no frills model. If you want RGB then this is too barebones for you. If you want solid FPS, great visuals with a low power draw, this card will do just fine. It's a two slot card, with one 8pin connector for power that gets the job done. You could run this on 650w power supply just fine, even though I already have a 750w in my current system. Fan speed is almost unnoticeable and there's no coil whine, even under intensive gaming, like Cyberpunk 2077.Cons: It's plain, no RGB. If you have a smaller case this card may be too big, go with the ASUS double fan model, if you still like ASUS after the whole mobo fiasco ;)Overall; Get the card, it won't let you down. It just works."", 'I love this card. I updated from a RTX 3070 to this and run on a 1440p 165hz monitor.  Great looking games look and play better.  You can see the difference in titles like The Last of Us, Redfall, Witcher 3, and Hogwarts Legacy. Very smooth and I like the reduced power requirements.  Wish it had some Rgb lighting but not a deal breaker*please note that through Amazon, this card doesn’t appear to be part of the Overwatch 2 Battlepass bundle promotion that is going on with the 4000 series.  I purchased it through Amazon because of the ease of shipping and reliability, but it seems as though they aren’t taking part in the promotion or something.  I was directed though MSIs page to Amazon and ordered but didn’t get any information about the code  for redemption. Tried Amazon customer service because the landing page for the promotion on Amazon was shut down (ended today even though I purchased before the end date).  Customer service couldn’t locate any info on the promotion. I provided all the info I saw on Nvidia and MSI regarding it.  Basically hit a brick wall.  Such a shame, as I went with Amazon for their reliability.  I don’t regret my purchase but I’ll definitely be making sure that if there is a promotion to check and see that Amazon is really taking part in it.', 'Sin duda cumplio con mucho mejor calidad y expectativa este producto. Excelente', 'Good gpu', ""While I realize the cost of this GPU is higher than comparable AMD GPUs, I went with this particular card because I was looking for a new gen GPU that wouldn't require me to upgrade my 650w PSU. I was originally looking for a Zotac 4070 Twin OC for the size, but with both products being the same size, I decided to go with this card as it has three fans compared to the two the Zotac offers. During gaming sessions playing Dead Island 2 and other multi player games like Fortnite, etc., I get temps of 43 C.

I've been at this s long time and remember when the best cards you could buy were 5 or 600 dollars.. This card does what I need it to and I must have won the silicon lottery for the first time in a while because I can overclock this card just past 3000 megahertz on the chip and I can't remember the clock on the memory but I have it plus 1100 and it runs great.

To find out my cpu fans wouldn\'t fit with this product (My fault as I should have done more research) but with a purchase of a smaller fan got everything to fit inside early May.Issues:At this time this is where some of the issues began, I would be able to play the newly released at the time Jedi Survivor on max settings with no issues, until I would close out of the game that is. It was a 50% chance that closing the game would do one of two things, give me a black screen for about 10-20 seconds or it would give me the black screen, then tell me my PC ran into a problem and restarted. I figured it was a driver issue as I accidentally managed to install it twice through browser and the app so I reinstalled it. That seemed to help in the moment but the second I opened my mouth saying I fixed it, the issues came right back doing the same thing. My friend point out that the cable I was using for the card which was a splitter cable couldn\'t handle the power my card was sending, so instead of using one cable I switched to using two. Yet again fixed for the moment but the issues were still there. I figured I\'d just deal with it in hopes Nvidia was working on a new driver update to fix the issue, until more problems started developing. This time when the screens went black and it wouldn\'t give me the error it would then have another 50% of majorly lagging, which I found even more ridiculous since I was closing the game and not opening it. About early June up until the 25th it got worse, to the point I couldn\'t even run the desktop at times because it would begin to lag so badly. The main two games I was playing at the time were Jedi Survivor and Battlebit Remastered. Jedi survivor I had to go from max settings down to the lowest to get it to run properly and Battlebit which is equivalent to Roblox would let me play a game in a half before crashing and sometimes lag my desktop so bad I would have to restart which was more often the case.The reason:The reason for this was because of power surges the graphics card was sending through to my power supply. I tried to use msi afterburner to undervolted the card which would help in the moment but eventually the surge would push past the limiter I had placed.What fixed it:I finally did some research and found a 7 minute video from FilledWithChi11 on YouTube that he showed a bunch of different things that he tried, how you will know you are watching the right video is after each thing you can try he says ""this didn\'t work for me."" I tried nearly everything in the video and what I believe was the solution for me was going into Bios and changing my PCIE settings from auto (What I presume was defaulting to Gen 4) and switched it to Gen 3, So far I\'ve had minor lag once and no black screens or crashes.To pay $1300 (which was what I paid for before price drop and in its current state should be worth a lot less) and to get more issues than it solved is outrageous. Next time I upgrade I\'m just gonna switch to an AMD card as I\'ve yet to have any issues with their processors. Now-a-days it seems to be race to see who can release the worse product possible and I\'m done wasting money on these greedy companies that are too lazy to properly test their products.Now that the issues seem to be resolved I can now played Jedi Survivor on max settings again and Battlebit no longer crashes and lags my PC. How it should\'ve been out of the box without the hassle.Bottom line is do more research before you spend your money because you might just end up wasting it.', 'If you are working with limited space that can\'t house a 4080/4090 and want the most GPU you can get, this is your play.  Incredibly power efficient and delivers excellent 1440p performance (with RT & nvenc/av1 encoding for both Twitch & YT streaming)This is a true 2 slot (2""), 3 fan (92mmX3) GPU that isn\'t overly long (12.1"") and with a narrower (4.7"") than normal width (which won\'t stress the 12VHPWR adapter) as much with crazy bends. The packaged adapter is a two way split that allows it to connect to previous gen PSU\'s with two PCIE lines to power the card. (Be very careful that it is plugged in securely)As for performance, with a slight OC, it spits out 1440p frames almost on par with a less efficient/less feature loaded 7900XT.  As with most mid to higher tier GPU\'s, you can hear the coil and fans when under load, however I game with a headset most of the time to where this isn\'t an issue.If you\'re working with limited space and don\'t care about unicorn-vomit RGB lighting, this is the smallest (and often the most affordable) 4070 Ti that you can find currently.  Product registration with msi will add an additional 3mos to your manufacturers warranty as well.

I didn\'t and it barely fits in my PC. For reference I used a 1060 before and it is almost twice the size if not actually twice the size.

I do not love the price but at least it isn\'t being scalped. Sure the 4090 has more performance but it also requires more of everything including money. My current system has a 5800x3d cpu with a 750 watt psu and it runs great. Quiet and cool. I have a large case and a Scythe Fuma 2 cpu cooler and have yet to hear any fan noise. I left it on default which is quiet mode. Performance mode just makes the card loud for a few percent increase in frames. Not worth it. My system would not handle a 4090 and upgrading everything so it could would cost me more in additional funds than the price of the 4080 alone so it made perfect sense to me. I am not a fan of rainbow led unicorn vomit so I installed Asus Armory Crate and made the logo a static color. The logo is the only led and default is unicorn vomit. You can also unplug the led connector on the board to permanently turn off the led. I like the static color as I can only tell my PC is on if I see the logo light on. My room is on the ocean so I have ambient sound of waves crashing so in a perfectly silent room you might hear it. My internet was out when the package arrived and I had to wait for it to come back on before I could install the drivers from Nvidia. Keep that in mind as no software comes with it. My monitor is an Odyssey G9 49"" 240hz and games look mind blowing on it. Almost like controlling the actors in a movie. If you have anything less than a 3090 ftw I would highly recommend this card. The 4070 ti is something I considered but at my resolution I would have to turn the settings down so I skipped it.

Highly recommend.', 'This riser gets it done and is probably the best PCIe 4.0 riser out there from my research. However, despite working great, the rest is anything but. I give it 3.5 stars but rounded to 4 due to points for making one in the first place, unlike several major manufacturers that should be. Lian Li gets points for this.First, and foremost, the mount is super flimsy. Even my stock RTX 3080 Ti FTW3 GPU is too heavy for the mount. It seems even worse with my EKWB water block weight.  It is made from PCB material and is very narrow. This is ridiculous with the weight of today’s GPUs with massive coolers. The cards will only get heavier and this is already outmatched. The mount sits bent from the weight of the GPU alone. I’m literally afraid I’ll snap it every time I put my card into the slot, or take it out. I apply the weakest pressure possible which obviously causes seating concerns. I have now decided to wedge a piece of metal under it every time to alleviate some of the flexing. This is bad on a very expensive riser, and is probably not covered by warranty. Just make a stronger base. Come on man???? $70 for this filmsy base?? Charge me $5 more and make something slightly durable.Second, the riser is not aesthetically pleasing from a company known for being the opposite. Why not make it look a little better? One of the cables came all bent up. It looks like a different material, but come on at least send me one that is factory straight.Third, this cable length does not allow me to mount the GPU in my cases location next to the MB. It bunches up the riser and pushes on the GPU because it is too long. This works out fine to have my GPU in the forward position now that I have narrowed the width with water block, but when I was using the stock air cooler it was right next to the glass, starving for air intake. Please make a version 100mm shorter or maybe a version that goes at a right angle down even better. Who needs those pesky 3.0 and 4.0 slots anyway when I have a 5.0 slot with maybe the actual manufacturers’ testing devices that can actually take advantage of the bandwidth.', 'Im getting the same performance (FPS) as if the GPU was in the mobo slot.Great build quality.****the plastic piece on it slides**** it is very easy to break.', ""I put together two workstation computers recently and tested out several brands of PCI-e cables to see what worked best.  Initially I could get the computer to boot using this Lian Li cable at PCI-e Gen4, but after installing the nvidia driver the system became unstable.  The computer would boot, but the screen refresh would be inconsistent and laggy. Connecting the GPU directly to the motherboard eliminated the problem, which then came back when the cable was used again. Setting the speed to PCI-e Gen3 resolved the issue. Now I am running the GPUs at PCI-e Gen3 speed with these cables (which is fine for my purpose) and the system is stable. I know one other person who independently had the same issue and had to run at Gen3 speed when using this cable.The cable is rated as PCI-e 4.0 but it can't do this consistently. Pick a cheaper PCI-e 3.0 cable (EZDIY-FAB and Lesozoh both worked well for me) or a different brand of PCI-e 4.0 cable if you really need the speed. ThermalTake was the only brand of Gen4 cable that worked at Gen 4 speed for me, but it is also the most expensive. The ThermalTake cable is thicker and stiffer than this one, so it probably has better insulation or thicker wires explaining why it works better for PCI-e Gen4.If you want to use this as a PCI-e 3.0 cable it will work great and the build quality is good."", 'Leider etwas kostspielig, allerdings ist die Möglichkeit die Grafikkarte so weit entfernt zu montieren einzigartig.

Box was sealed and honestly great performance for the platform of gamers it aims for it’s a great card!Tiny form factor! I just upgraded from a EVGA 1060gb 6gb single fan and it’s roughly the same size as the older model! The cooler on it is massive! The Asus phoenix generally takes 3 slots while the evga would only take two slots.Specs: It’s roughly in the same ball park as a 1080ti and a 2070 super. You can game on a 1080p monitor and get 60-80fps ultra settings but I’ve seen it also get 50-70fps on a 1440p I just think it’s the drivers or Ampere technology making it utilize so well in 2k. In my opinion the 3060 can get 70fps average on 1080p and 60 fps average on 2k, 4k however it struggles with medium/high settings only getting 20-50fps.Thermals are great! My GTX 1060 6gb was hitting 90c while this one runs around 60-80c it’s also quieter too! Both GPUs use the same 100% utilization when gaming at similar specs.Overall: It’s a great mid tier card! If you plan on gaming with high refresh rate of 144hz on 1080p your definitely getting 80fps average!At 1440p you can definitely game at 60fps average! At 4K it’s playable if you are okay with 30-50fps average.Personally: I’m having buyers remorse, I wish I went with the 3060ti because the 27% increase in performance would definitely please my 60 fps needs at 3k gaming! Im running at 3960x1080p resolution triple monitor and my fps is averaging 40-50fps which is expected because at 4K i would be getting the same fps. I might be limited by my cpu and pcie 3.0 so I might get better results if I upgrade my mobo and cpu more testing needs to be done, but in my opinion the 3060 ti would definitely get me the 60 fps I need except in GTA V it runs 60fps solid, but that’s because the game runs better on triple monitors.Cons: What’s the point of 12gb vram? Ampere is great but the GPU is actually the same as a 3060 6gb laptop variant. I get the same fps I would on my laptop with both systems getting average 70fps on 1080p ultra gaming.It’s odd but when utilizing 3.5gigs of vram I can maintain 70fps+ on high settings but if you go into 5 gig or 6 gig territory the card really struggles, it’s like only 4 gigs of vram is actually been properly utilized and the extra 8 is just crap in comparison. Maybe it’s the 192-bit bus because I’ve only seen it utilize 4gigs properly.Personally it’s a great 1080p card if you want 144fps 1440p card for 60fps but it will struggle in 4K gaming.If you want high refresh rates I would definitely go with 3060 ti and above because I feel like this card can only perform at best 75fps 1080p ultra settings with low raytracing from what I’ve seen.The only game I’ve seen it get 240fps is League of Legends.My 1060 6gb was only getting max 140fps so it’s definitely an upgrade but I’m not really seeing a difference on my 144hz monitorIs this a card I’m planning on using for a while? No with todays age and 2k gaming and 4K being widespread you can use a small 2k monitor and average 60fps but With 4K 144hz is almost around the corner so I see myself upgrading in the near future very soon.Sadly I can’t return it because it’s a GPU things are hard to get and I enjoy 1080p ultra setting gaming at 70fps. But is 600$ worth it? Nah I would rather get a 3060ti because you would definitely get 120+ fps at 1080p on ultra.If I sold my 1060 at 250$ msrp i would definitely gotten the 3060 at 350 msrp maybe scalpers are trying to make us give away our old gpus to everyone haha!I do enjoy how my 3060 laptop and my 3060pc give the same performance in all the games! Ampere is definitely ahead of its time when it comes to utilization!', '', 'Does what I expected it to do.  Sped up my AI generation and works great for all my games!', ""Replaced a GTX 1650 with this and it's making short work of my A.I. renders, the 12gb VRAM really comes in handy. Being a single fan the noise is negligable and the chassis is a big heat sink so it runs cool and the short size makes for better airflow in the tower. These are great and I'll be picking up another for my other desktop."", 'It is running Diablo 4 at high settings and no problems at all.Of course my screen is Full HD 1920x1080.Will update this review if something comes up.First Review date: July 2 2023', 'You can use XL checkpoints with this card and it great for 1080p gamingVERY quiet.

AMD built in tuning allowed me to get the 580 to run nearly silently along with my low powered/silent case fans there was no sound in my room at you couldn't tell the PC was on at all unless you look for the power led. On the lowest tuning settings that will run stable the 3060 still has noticeable sound compatible to murmurs when running a moderately challenging game like warzone but something that leans on the GPU more like Warframe will have the card whirring up to about the sound of a space heater/conversation but not quite ear destroying levels like a hairdryer. Coming from a dead silent card I was annoyed that you can't lower the fan speed below 30% using driver settings or the asus tuning app. I don't like having to rely on MSI Afterburner but it is the only way to quiet the fan lower then being at a constant whisper. Graphically it works as you'd expect from watching any youtube video comparison so really the only thing to consider is if the card runs hot (nope) or if the card is the right size for you case (nearly as small as the pci slot) and if the sound levels are tolerable (quiet enough if you're patient). If you can live with 30% fan sound background noise or don't mind the risks of setting your own afterburner settings then it's a solid buy. I found it sold by amazon delivered by amazon for 50 bucks over MSRP so I'm satisfied with that markup all things considered. 9/10 would be perfect if I could get  the sound under control without relying on outside apps."", 'Needed a cost effective solution for ML inference on my home server , this works very well.The small form factor and low noise levels are great for this use case.', 'plays all my games at 1080 high detail.']"

People online said that the Fighter variant ran very hot which was also a concern. I haven’t had any issues with temps, max being in the low 70s with fan speed set to hit 70% at 70C. Managed to get an extra 100Mhz on the core and 250Mhz on the memory fully stable. This is a no frills GPU that will perform just as well as the others for much less money. PowerColor offers a two year warranty from the date of purchase through specific retailers (Amazon being one). Check their website and make sure you purchase through one of their listed retailers to get the warranty. Upgraded from a 1060 3GB and the performance is more than double sometimes even triple. The 6600 XT doesn’t draw a ton of power like other newer cards so I was able to keep the PSU from the original build. If you’re strictly looking for performance and don’t care about frills then I recommend giving this card a chance. Outstanding 1080p performance and does a great job in 1440p as well. You can even run a lot of games in 4K with lowered graphics settings and realistic expectations. I will update if anything changes.', 'PowerColor Fighter AMD Radeon RX 6600 XTPrice was $299.  I needed a GPU to put in a new PC until new stuff drops later this year or early next year.  I put this in and paired it with a 5900x that was given to me as a gift.  Tested Xcom 2, Age of Empires IV, Horizon Zero Dawn, and several other games.  Thing pushed Ultra settings and high enough frame rates that it was all smooth.  Turned down a few things from ultra on FPS games to maximize frame rate.  Temps with the system are lower than most review sites and builders I had read posts from.  And the power consumption is fairly low given the performance.Overall this GPU performed better than I expected.  I was considering a 6700 XT but glad I went this route until the next line of GPUs hit.

In più il prezzo (e parlo di quello d\'uscita) non era così accattivante. Oggi però sappiamo che il mercato ha prezzi altissimi e e trovare anche questa scheda a prezzi umani è molto difficile.

I'll come back and update it in a few days.I'm someone who has used many XFX cards in the last few years and they had never dissapointed me until I got this one. Don't get me wrong, it runs, however, it's pretty hot even with a custom fan curve.I used to run a XFX RX 580, which ran at 68°C core, then I had a XFX RX 5500 XT Thicc II which ran at 61°C core and memories were always under 70°C. Same with the Asus RX 5600 XT EVO Dual TOP that I'm replacing now. It ran at 61°C core, 73°C junction and the memories about 74°C. All of them working in an airflow focused big case with 6 fans.This one is running at 74°C core and 84°C junction with the fans at 80%. I know, it does its job but it's pretty hot for what I'm used to.I'm wondering if I'm having the same issue I had with my old RX 5500 XT where the thermal compound was pretty bad, and it started running hotter which each passing day. After three months of use it was running 12°C hotter until I replaced the thermal compound and it came back to its normal temperature.For some reason I'm not getting the memories' temperature on afterburner. I'll check if this is because of the app or the card. I'll check later and update this. I don't really mind the core running at 74°C as long as the memories are running at a decent temperature.Updates after a week of use:The cars does indeed get fairly hot even after undervolting to 1000mV from 1050mV. Part of the time I see the junction temperature going well over 90°C (I think it was 94°C) while the edge temperature is about 68°C-70°C.According to AMD this junction temperature is acceptable but it is close to the 105°C limit they claim.Edit after 10 months of use:I still can't get the memory temperatures. After changing thermal paste and applying some extra pressure to the heat spreader the temperatures went down to normal levels.This card allowed for a lot of undervolting while providing the same if not better performance. The undervolting didn't make much of a difference in temperature but it's something, it reduced it for a out 3°C.I have been using it for 1440p gaming and it has performed greatly. There have been a noticeable increase in performance via drivers since the launch date, specially in DX11 games (I used to play Ark: Survival Evolved with ultra settings at 75fps average with this card, now I can play it at about 100fps, and that's one of the most gamrsphicslly demanding games."", 'Ho preso questa scheda video perchè guardando online aveva prestazioni simili o superiore alla Nvidia 3060 e devo dire che non ne sono per nulla deluso.Questa scheda ha dimostrato di avere un\'ottima potenza e velocità: score 100% su CPU userbenchmark, frame rate allo stesso livello o leggermente superiore alla 3060 (ovviamente senza attivare ray tracing e DLSS)Un altro punto a favore di questa scheda è l\'ottima dissipazione del calore: le temperature non sono riuscite a toccare i 70° nonostante il benchmark da un\'ora, utilizzo GPU fisso a 99% e case ristretto, per quanto il flusso d\'aria sia buono. Occhio però che comunque questa scheda scalda: ne uscirà di aria calda dal vostro case, quindi assicuratevi di avere un buon flusso d\'aria, o le temperature saliranno ulteriormente.Un altro punto a favore è il fatto che questa effettivamente occupi solo due slot all\'interno e non vada ad ingombrare gli slot PCI adiacenti: un\'altra scheda video che ho comprato aveva le ventole che andavano ad occupare lo slot adiacente, nonostante su carta e sul case occupasse solo 2 slot... Una gran rottura di scatole, ma come potete vedere da foto potete tranquillamente montare altre componenti nelle immediate vicinanzeUnica pecca secondo me sono le ventole le quali sono tanto efficaci quanto rumorose: di default vanno pianissimo e addirittura tengono la scheda a 33° (d\'estate!), ma non appena OSATE utilizzare la scheda video, resteranno al massimo in modalità ""mo-faccio-più-casino-del-ventilatore-mannaggia-all\'eolo"" fino a quando le temperature non scenderanno di nuovo sotto i 40°...

Installation was smooth and simple; I did have to wipe my computer's drivers completely as I was migrating from Nvidia.If you care about software that is associated with graphics drivers, I warn you that AMD's driver software is known to be buggy at times, but it is fairly navigable and it looks aesthetically pleasing.Personally, I have noticed a huge difference between this card and my old rtx 2060 I bought in the fall of 2019. Though this is a dual fan design, this card is massively larger than what I initially thought it was. It measures around 11.5 inches length wise and takes up about 2.5 pcie slots.

Due to price, I chose MSI over ASRock because MSI has been longer in the GPU game. But I have heard that MSI\'s AMD GPUs are inferiorly built compared to its Nvidia GPUs.Pros:1. Fits in my small PC case. This was one of only four RX 6700 XT variants that would fit in my case.2. Performs well enough, when it works (see cons below).Cons:1. Cooling could be better. The GPU runs a little hot, and while it seems to remain within spec temperature wise, I can\'t tell whether thermal throttling occurs when reaching peak junction/hotspot temperatures.2. Even in Nov 2022, I am experiencing driver crashes. However, I can\'t tell if the issue is with the silicon on this device, the AMD drivers, AMD\'s Adrenalin software, or the games (e.g., Tom Clancy\'s The Division 2) that I\'m playing. I experienced some crashes with my previous Nvidia GPU, but I am experiencing many more with this AMD GPU. (I\'m using Windows 11.) I\'ve tried different driver versions, while using DDU to erase every trace of NVIDIA and AMD drivers in between. The uncertainty on whether this is a hardware or a software issue is driving me to consider switching to a different product/brand.3. Not an issue with the product, but might affect whether one buys said product: After registration, the product\'s webpage does not specify when its warranty will end. It just states, ""Standard Warranty: Depending on territory Regional differences may apply. Please enquire with the original shops."" I bought it from Amazon U.S., which should be an authorized retailer, but I\'ve asked MSI customer support twice already on what date this product\'s warranty will expire. Each time, they gave me the same generic, textbook answer: paraphrasing, ""3 years after manufacture date (May 2025) or 3 years after purchase date (Oct 2025)."" There are 4 months between the two dates, which could make a difference down the line. I have another GPU from an MSI competitor, and that product\'s page states the exact date when the warranty will expire.Edit: After 3 attempts, I finally received the exact date of my warranty\'s expiration, 3 years from time of purchase. This, however, came in an email from customer service, while the product\'s page remains vague about the warranty.', ""I bought this card as a replacement for my GTX 970. So far, performance has been great, running demanding games on Ultra such as The Last of Us and Assassin's Creed Odyssey without any issue. It is a great GPU that will let you run most games with graphic set at the highest.The only caveat is that junction temperature got a little hot at times (above 90°C). However, using the AMD Adrenalin software, I undervolted the card and now temperatures are way better without loss of performance and fans not working at full speed.I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a good gaming GPU who doesn't want to spend too much but still wants to have great gaming performance."", 'The first graphics card that came to me arrived very quickly.

The 3060 seemed like an affordable option and has 12GB RAM.The instructions envelope had strange white scuffed marks or dust on the cover and was unsealed. There was a noticeable scratch on the envelope too. The plastic that sealed the box had a small hole, which could indicate resealing. The corners of the box had signs of roughness and the interior card box had a weak feel, as if it opened more than once. There was a small spec of dirt inside the bag on the card plate. This card was a possible refurb or open-boxed and sold as ""new"" in my opinion. This wouldn\'t be the first product I ordered in this condition.... The card itself looked unused.The lack of DVI port was very inconvenient for me as my main monitor uses it to display at 144hz. I have had to resort to adapter cables for my two older HDMI monitors. My 1060 has two HDMI, 2 display ports as well as the DVI connector that was very convenient. The 3060 only comes with one HDMI port and three display ports. I also have had to buy a special adapter for around $50 to get my older Acer monitor to run at higher than 60hz. It is annoying NVIDIA or MSI would cease using the DVI connector as it could easily be put on the card design like the 1060 had; or they could design a second model version using the connector. But hey they just want you to buy a new monitor okay...I could not fit the HDMI connection into place due to the design on my computer case. There was sort of a metal bar part of the case (admittedly it seems like a bad design of my computer case) right above the HDMI slot. I ended up having to twist the obstructive ""metal"" and out of the way with pliers and basically damage my case in order to plug in the HDMI cable. It was either that spend another $50 on a riser cable for the card which I don’t want to do. I noticed my 1060 had the HDMI ports on the left side, which is why I never had a problem with it, while the 3060 has them on the right...The card is a very tight fit next to my Noctua cooler due to the card\'s backplate.The card is maybe double or triple the performance of a 1060 but compared to better or more expensive cards it is only okay. Maybe the best part is the 12GB RAM. Temps range between 65-70 when card is on load in my fully air-cooled case. Of course, it depends on room temperature.I get full 144hz frame rate from my monitor in games like Apex at 1080p with minor frame drops here or there. However, Apex is so poorly optimized in my opinion and it can still feel like I\'m playing on my 1060. I also saw a performance boost in applications that rely on the GPU that I use. I would not have paid near $400 for the 3060 and I am glad I got it on sale, thanks to the 4060\'s launch I suppose.

I'm used to more lower-mid tier GPUs where you can only push it to about 70-80% before you get stuttering or heat problems and the like. You know what I mean if you've used what I'm talking about.I mention it because this card lets you push RIGHT UP TO THE LIMIT of it's specs! You get your money's worth! Just one caveat though. The card is liable to crash once it hits it's limit; not saying it's bad, just appraising you of the reality of what will happen if you do. Unlike crappier cards, it doesn't hit you with stuttering, heat problems, or crashing FPS when it does. It just stops. That's it. So be mindful when you plug it in and want to see how far it  can go.

It worked for holding the card in a vertical position, somewhat.  It is kind of flimsy and the card sagged, it came with foam squares your supposed to wedge under the bracket to hold up any sagging.  The ARGB only lit up on one side a dull bluish color and never did more than that.  I emailed the seller, they wanted pictures, videos, and essay on how I installed, and wanted me to send them all that and they would decide if they would do anything.  That's the last I ever heard of them... I think I sent them a pick of it installed.  I would not recommend this bracket and would find a better one.  I lost my money on this, and will not be buying any more stuff from this seller.UPDATE:  This Seller has GREAT Customer Service.  They read my review, and contacted me immediately, and after a couple back and forths, they made things right.  I have upped my star rating because of this.  Even though my ARGB Video card bracket might not have worked for me, maybe one of those bad apples that made it thru QA, everything else that I had bought from them has worked well, my fans are looking good and doing the job.

Also if you are using a wifi card this mount allows it to slide up a small amount to fit both the rgb on the mount it's self is pretty good not terrible it's still vibrant. If you have a gpu that's got 3 fans I would use the brace to stop the front of the gpu from drooping a little.

Neither does the case have a lot of room for mounting the GPU vertically. While the case has tons of room in many ways and many places, the distance from the motherboard to the glass panel is a bit tight. I had a hard time getting a CPU cooler and fans for the Ryzen 5 CPU I built for this.Turned out the 120mm fans & Noctua cooler, which is what I wanted, and several other coolers that would have worked were too tall to fit. The case isn\'t accurately measured for the distance from the top of the CPU to the glass panel. Also, not all coolers measure things the same way. Turns out some don\'t include the copper plate, and/or the heat pipes in the total height of the cooler. After trying many combinations of them, turned out that the best way was to put 3 92mm fans onto a Noctua 92mm dual tower cooler. That keeps this CPU cool enough, even with the overclocking I was able to get (happily, I seem to have hit a minor jackpot in the silicon lottery, and got a better than average chip, as I can go to 4.6Ghz, which is well above rated maximum. Not 100% stable up there, but 4.4Ghz is completely stable.)Anyway, my point is this: The case is a little tight on space in certain dimensions.A number of these vertical GPU mounts push the GPU card out toward the side panel.I spent way too much time trying to over-engineer pushing the card a little further to the right to get it to clear a half-height PCIE card that would be behind the GPU, since I couldn\'t get the GPU further away from the motherboard, and it was bumping that other card--which is kind of essential for me.Turns out that it was a LOT easier than I was making it.It would have been easier to see what I needed to do to get it positioned right if I\'d actually tried the install, but the instructions were somewhat lacking in clarity. Diagrams were small and didn\'t help much.Once I actually started to put things into place, I realized I could drop the mount down one notch on the mounting plate, and everything worked. It cleared the small card behind the GPU, and the closest it comes to the glass panel is 1/4"". The fans are more than 1/2"" from the glass, and things are cooling just fine.Now, the RGB gave me a little trouble...when I connected it to the RGB header on the motherboard, it would flicker and shift colors every few seconds. When I synched it to the rest of the RGB, it picked up and made all the changes and patterns it should. But every few seconds, there was a flicker, and odd colors flashing. I expect this is a result of the rest of the RGB in my system. I changed where it was connected, putting it to the RGB controller in back of the system, and everything is fine now.So, with a little bit better instructions, and me not following Mr. Scott\'s warning about over-ticking the plumbing, I\'d have had it installed in 10 minutes and it would have been fine.So I give it 5 stars, as the instructions wouldn\'t be all that big of a deal in the grand scheme.', 'Bon produit mais un peu chip bon rapport qualité.Vendeur a l’écoute.À voir dans le temps je modifierais mon commentaire d’ici la.', 'Alors à 1ere ça a l’air pas mal, mais question qualité à ce prix là faut pas s’attendre à du haut de gamme, installation pas si simple ( pourtant je suis pas novice en la matière ) le problème est aussi le câble pcie dommage que ce soit pas en 4 .Sinon le rendue et pas trop mal mais je pense à l’avenir acheter le LianLi qui va avec ce boîtier !']"

Able to support games like DOTA easily.', 'Finally arrived 1 Month late - still showing as lost/no delivery. It works with the Dell SFF 3470/3471 small desktops who have an PSU of 200 Watts. Mine has 200 W and this card will work with it. I use MSI Afterburner but only installed the drivers Windows downloads and the nVIDIA control panel on Microsoft Store. Should Dell guide you to the GT 730 only then just go with this GT 1030 since it works and doesnt overstress the PSU, as long you dont overclock this Graphics. I have the 9th gen i3-9100 quad core no hyperthreading but boost enabled processor in my new rig. That combined with total of 24 GB of RAM and this GT 1030 is an well matched system. On an test game (H&G) the Processor load hovers around 65%, the max RAM used is  about 10.5 GB of RAM and the GT 1030 is loaded to about 99% on medium settings and at 1080p resolution which gave around 40 FPS (at 720p and low settings the GT 1030 is loaded to about 68% using 8 GB of system RAM, which gives around 60 FPS) . With MSI Afterburner I limited the max Temperature of the GT 1030 to 68 Celsius with 87% power and fan on auto (50% fan speed when 68 Celsius is reached at about 1300 MHz clock speed average - it clocks down at max temp) to maximize card longevity. At normal office work and entertainment like movie watching, etc the GT 1030 has an average temperature of around 41 degrees Celsius at 700 Mhz clock and fan at 35%. So be aware that this GT 1030 is by all means the bottle neck of this system and most likely any new processor with enough RAM will outperform this Graphic card. So low end new processors match well with this Card. The integrated UHD 630 of the processor had way more stutters and probably half as much FPS as the game was with this card way more playable, had better graphics and a very smooth picture scroll when turning around (FPS). With the integrated graphics (UHD 630) the total system RAM used was as high as 50% meaning around 12 GB.So overall I just recommend this GT 1030 since it gives an way better experience and is a very good match to any low powered systems and low end new gen processors. With this particular game the GT 1030 was pegged at 99%, while the CPU hovered around up to max 75% and the RAM today needed for this system would be about at least 12 GB (I had 24 GB total RAM installed). All mayor components match each other very well with this system. The box states the transistors are ""military grade"" and have an aluminum core, while the card lasts 40 years normal office use at 60 Degrees Celsius (365000 hours) and 10 years for gaming when at 70 Degrees Celsius (112000 hours). While both fans, of the CPU and GT 1030 are on there is an noticeable humming sound when the graphics are not temp limited which could get annoying over time for students, etc (people used to total silence environment). While on entertaining (watching movies, Youtube, etc) the fans humming is not noticeable. The Dell SFF I have has only one single fan for the CPU and no desktop chassis fans whatsoever, additionally to the PSU fan. So the GT 1030\'s fan will provide a better air flow within the chassis as to help cool surrounding components as well as it moves air within the chassis. Thats a good thing although not totally silent. On 99% load, 68 Celsius temp limit, the GT 1030 fan is not noticeable louder as at normal 35% speed - again, no overclocking. To overclock (which I am not a friend of since it shortens the GT 1030\'s life span) the PSU must be at least 300 Watts. So in my case with an 200 Watt PSU I would never risk to overclock this GPU. It works and is an good GPU for medium games, Foto rendering and video editing. At least an 100% improvement over the UHD 630 integrated Graphics the i3-9100 came with. However the GT 1030 is not noticeable lowering the work load of the processor since it has similar loads with integrated or this dedicated card - indicating the GT 1030 is not helping the CPU processing its chores. I recommend this GT 1030 since its for sure an improvement over any integrated Intel graphics (dunno about the Ryzen integrated Vega 11 of ATI, since that should be similar to the GT 1030). Get the GDDR5 instead of the GDDR4. On my system the Memory speed of the GT 1030 clocks at 3000 Mhz while the card states its capable of 6000 Mhz - PCIe states 4 lanes used (or something) which maybe the cause of that.', 'bought this because I need more ports for multiple monitors. The card can well support my two 2k monitors, and you can barely hear the fan', ""I bought this card after my first choice jumped from $70 to $90 (plus $13 shipping) - this one was $99 with free shipping (now they're all >$139 - what's with these prices?).  I got it sooner than I was told (which is always good) and in reasonable condition (shipped in bubblewrap envelope).  The card itself is fairly heavy (because of the heatsink of course) but the circuit board is pretty light weight - it flexes a little more than I'm comfortable with (so no manhandling this card).  I installed it in a pc with an Asrock J4105m board and a 240GB PNY SSD - so the only moving parts in the whole system are the optical drive and the 120mm fan in the power supply.  It is pretty quiet to say the least.Performance-wise, here are some numbers (keep in mind, the J4105m board only has 1x PCIE slots - even the full length one)Passmark Performance test: 2D:315 3D:1085 (a gt1050 scored 317 and 1527 respectively)Time Spy GPU score:1024 (GTX1050 - 1715)Fire Strike GPU score: 3403 (GTX1050 - 6400)Wildlife score: 7814 (GTX 1050 - 13889)Night Raid GPU: 14414 (22402)Sky Diver GPU: 10898 (20653)You get the idea (if I ever move this to a PC with a full 16x PCIE bus, I'll update the figures).

It is only one GT 1030, with 2GB DDR5. It is fanless.  It does come with a low profile bracket.  Here\'s the problem: to install the low profile bracket, you must remove the two screws that secure the regular size bracket.  But one of those screws is blocked by the giant heatsink, so you must also remove the four screws that secure the heatsink, and remove the heatsink.  One of these screws has a little ""void warranty"" sticker over the screw head--so it seems that you void the warranty if you want to install the low profile bracket (?).  In addition, when you remove the heatsink you expose the thermal grease covering the GPU and the 2 thermal pads covering the memory chips.  If you\'ve built PCs you know that before you put the heatsink back in place you\'re supposed to clean off the old grease and remove the old thermal pads, then put new grease on and install new thermal pads.  I did not replace the grease or put on new thermal pads; so far the heat is okay when I run the card.  I don\'t game; the biggest stress I put on it so far was running a 5 minute 2K60fps video clip on my 2k monitor.  The warmest the GPU got was 49 degrees Celsius.

I originally purchased an EVGA GTX 1070 FTW model. But after having to replace it once, having to struggle with crashing/instability, and then seeing reports of VRM heating issues/design flaws, I thought it was time for a change. I’ll be comparing the ASUS GTX 1070 STRIX ROG OC Edition to my experience with the EVGA GTX 1070 FTW model. Both are arguably the flagship ‘premium’ 1070 cards on the market.Disclaimer: None. I bought this card with my own hard earned money :). Despite my somewhat negative experience with EVGA, I will give an honest comparison. I think both EVGA and ASUS are excellent companies, so I won’t be hating on either.Ok! So let’s get to the good stuff!Aesthetics: Obviously, this is based on personal taste, so you may disagree with me here. I really liked EVGA’s metal finish to their fan shroud as well as glossy finish to their logo. At first, I was disappointed to see a plastic shroud and finish on the ASUS STRIX ROG card. However, photos don’t do this card justice. The card looks amazing in person. The fan shroud has a nice gun metal/gray finish to it, which I personally like. The back plate has a nice finish to it, as well as a cool pattern and the ROG logo. The color of the card is neutral, so it can work with just about any build design/color. There are LED’s on the side, around the fans, and on the back plate with their logo. It’s all completely customizable. Nice.Size/Form Factor: Wow! This card is HUGE! You MUST measure out if this card will fit in your case, unless you have a full size PC case. I have the Master Case Pro 5, a mid size case with plenty of room, and I STILL had to remove the drive bay adjacent to the motherboard to accommodate the sheer size of this GPU. Please, please, please, do your homework on this part to make sure this GPU will safely fit in your case.Misc.: This card comes with two fan headers so you can hook up case fans to your GPU. This way, when your card is heating up it can directly control up to two fans in your case to help with cooling. This is a nice way to customize your case’s cooling setup so that not all the case fans are operating based on CPU temperature. It’s a nice feature. Who knows, maybe I’ll hook up an extra fan to it down the road. On another note, this GPU takes one 8 pin connector for power, has a 6 +1 power phase, and used premium components in their build. At first, I sort of rolled my eyes and figured this was all marketing jargon. But wow, it sure makes a difference. This card performs very well even when the voltage and max power limits are raised. None of that buzzing noise or coil whine. This card also comes with two HDMI ports instead of just one. I am not sure how many people this will apply to, but this is a single BIOS card, unlike the dual BIOS EVGA FTW card. So if you are a customer looking to apply custom BIOS, I'd recommend going for the double BIOS cards. Moving on...Performance: I got the OC edition, and this card is advertised to get an 1860 mhz boost clock. Similar to my previous EVGA FTW card, this ASUS card far surpassed it’s advertised performance, without ANY overclocking or changes to default settings. At default settings, I recorded 2012 mhz, with 8014 memory clock, all running at a cool 58 degrees Celsius. This is pretty similar to default performance on my EVGA card out of the box.Overclocking: Now the exciting part! I highly recommend OC’ing this card, as this edition is really designed to be overclocked and it’s free extra performance. If some of you are concerned, it comes with 3 years limited warranty. Even if you max the voltage/power settings (which I did), this is still within limits set by the manufacturer. So, after setting Max Voltage to 100%, Power Limit: 120%, Temp. Target: 92 degrees Celsius, I achieved a nice overclock of: 2152 mhz GPU (although it stabilized to 2139 mHz), and a memory overclock of 9208 mhz. I made my own custom aggressive fan curve, so this operated at a very nice 64 degrees Celsius. These settings were stable on Valley Benchmark for hours. I'm pretty impressed with this performance. I can’t really compare the OC to my old EVGA card, because much of the performance variance is due to luck and the silicon lottery. I can say that they perform within +/- 5% of one another… a negligible difference in my opinion.Acoustics: At idle, this card is completely silent. Its fans don’t even turn on until it warms up a bit. The fans on this card are incredibly powerful. If you so desire, you could easily keep this card in the 50’s degrees Celsius, even with a hefty overclock. With overclocking, you are obviously sacrificing noise for performance. However, my personal limits for noise was when the fans passed 75% speed. WOW are they loud! As mentioned above, with my overclock the card maintained about 64 degrees Celsius, and this was with the fans operating at about 60-65% fan speed. Obviously, noise is very subjective and you may have a case that reduces sound better than mine, or you just won’t be bothered by it as much as me. I was very happy with the noise level when the fans were <75%.Applications: The ASUS GPU Tweak application is what I used to overclock this card. It is very user friendly, with a lot of preset settings such as: OC mode, Gaming Mode, and Silent Mode. I like Silent mode when I am not gaming. It essentially underclocks the card to keep it cool and quiet. I would ignore the other two modes as they apply a laughably negligible overclock to your card. You are better off setting up a custom profile after you find the limits of your card.Criticism: While the GPU Tweak application is nice, in order to control lighting and effects of your GPU you have to install another application called AURA. This is irritating. Why do I have to install another program just to control lights? Why can’t there be an additional tab on the Tweak application that is dedicated to lighting and special effects? Annoying. Another concern is due to the sheer size and weight of the card, I worry if I will have the dreaded GPU sag after a few months of use. Although the card looks sturdy and well built. Only time will tell. The last criticism is customer support. EVGA has 24/7 customer support, and the specialists tend to know what they are doing. In contrast, ASUS has limited hours for customer support, and I’ve been put on hold, told I’d receive a call back, or receive an e-mail, and it either took too long or never did. Big contrast here. In ASUS’ defense, I never had major issues with the card, and called for general inquiries. While EVGA’s service is excellent, I have had to call due to: fan control being broken, GPU temp exceeding 100 degrees Celsius, instability/crashing even when not overclocking, among other reasons. Only time will if ASUS’ card will perform will in the long run, I’ll be sure to post follow ups if anything happens.Final Thoughts: The ASUS GTX 1070 STRIX ROG OC edition is an absolute beast of a card. At the least, it performance as well as any other flagship 1070 from other manufacturers. At its best, it provides a buttery gaming experience, quiet gaming free of buzzing/coil whine, amazing overclocking, and great thermals. Again, my biggest concern is the size of this card, so be sure to check that it’ll fit in your case. The card is sleek and sexy but also color neutral. If it fits your taste, it will go with just about any case design or color scheme. Regarding value, I have a 1440p 75 Hz HP Omen, and this card is able to operate on all games I’ve thrown at it on ultra settings and with FPS well above 75. Obviously, this may differ depending on what game you buy. If you are on a 1080P monitor, this is overkill and you may want to consider a GTX 1060 or the ASUS GTX 1070 STRIX ROG non-OC model. What this card *may* struggle with: 4k gaming (you’ll want to save up for the GTX 1080 in that case), and with 1440p gaming on a monitor with very high refresh rates such as 144 Hz.At this point, I'd have to recommend the ASUS over the EVGA FTW graphics cards. As mentioned earlier, there are design flaws and issues with the current FTW cards. It's also not as neutral as the ASUS card, so it may not flow with any design or color scheme. Noise, acoustics, and performance are very user specific, depending on how you overclock/set fan settings, and in my personal experience both cards perform very competitively and produce similar levels of noise. If your heart is set on an EVGA card, then I'd recommend waiting for the FTW2 cards (which supposedly address all these issues) coming out sometime this year :).If you are looking for a card that has quality written all over it and will last you, look no further! Happy gaming!!!"", ""So this is the 4th GTX 1070 I've used.  I've used two different EVGA 1070 FTW cards, and an EVGA 1070 SC card, and this is easily the better than both the EVGA cards, at least in my experience, and this is coming from someone who is an EVGA fanboy...The included software isn't my favorite, I prefer the look and layout of MSI Afterburner or EVGA Precision X, but I will say that the Asus GPU Tweak tool is A LOT better than it used to be.  I used a previous version of GPU Tweak with an Asus 980ti that I had, and the software was very buggy, lots of glitches, would randomly crash, wouldn't remember profiles etc.  I have to say I haven't had a single problem with GPU Tweak with this Strix 1070.  I made a custom profile for all my settings with my manual overclock, and it remembers it all the time, everytime the pc reboots it automatically launches the GPU tweak tool and auto-loads my custom profile, perfect!Lighting:  The lighting adds a very cool effect to an already very good looking card, but there is some issue with color accuracy... Mostly white, you can pretty much forget trying to set the color to just plain white, when I try to set it to just white, it shows a purple color.  I don't mean like a 'hint of purple', I mean I turn on the white led setting and it is just totally purple.  Personally, I usually leave it on a different color anyway, but it is disappointing that they couldn't get a true white light.  From what I understand of RGB Leds it's a common issue, unless they have a seperate bulb/light devoted just to white, the RGB LED can't really do a true white.Temps/Fans:  First off, and most importantly, make sure your case has adequate airflow flowing to the card, don't complain about high temps if you're starving the card of fresh cool air.  At the moment I've got the card installed in an Evolv ATX case, and with just the two stock 140mm fans in the front of the case, it's getting plenty of air to breathe, even heavaly overclocked, the card only reaches 72C, max.  And that is with the stock fan profile where the fans don't spin up until about 60C... That's very impressive!  I normally don't like the whole 'silent at idle' thing a lot of gpu's do now, where the fans don't spin until a certain temp.  In the past with all my 900 series cards, and the EVGA 1070 cards i've used, I would always set up a custom fan profile, so the fans were always on, but would only really ramp up under heavy load, but with this card I really have no reason to do that.  It's a very well built cooling solution, no need for a custom fan profile.  Under heavy load it does become audible, but I wouldn't say it's loud, just...noticeable.  Also, absolutely no coil whine!  (All 3 of my EVGA 1070's had coil whine to some degree).One complaint about the fans, the middle fan will occasionally start spinning for no apparrent reason.  It's only the middle fan, and it does it seemingly at random when I'm not placing any kind of load on the GPU and the card is well under the 60C threshold where the fans should turn on, but that middle fan will just randomly turn on and off, when it happens it's really audible.  I'm working on trying to figure out what's causing it...Overclocking:  Again, better than all three EVGA 1070's I tried.  This may just be Silicon Lottery at work, but I was able to manually overclock the card, using GPU Tweak, I've got the GPU boost clock maxed out at 1926, +400 on the memory, I did have to do +10% GPU voltage to get it totally stable in all benchmarks, but this gives me a STABLE boost clock of 2050-2175 mhz.  It will peak up above 2100 mhz sometimes, but won't stay there, and like I said earlier, I've never seen it go above 72C.*I wanted to say something about the power connector... So I remember hearing someone in a vid on Youtube say that extra power connectors do not grantee higher overclocks, and I have to say that this has definitely been my observation so far, at least with the Pascal cards.  This card overclocks higher than all the EVGA cards I had, and I had two seperate FTW cards, that have dual 8-pin connectors, and this card has a single 8-pin and is EASILY beating those cards as far as max overclocks, and has lower temps... so what exactly IS the point of the extra 8-pin connectors?So to sum up:Pros:Looks awesome (that's subjective, but generally agreed)RGB lights are a nice touchGreat temps, even heavily overclocked!No coil whineGood overclockerCons:middle fan randomly turns on/off when the card is idle.The White led setting displays a purple light.I already want another one for SLI...I've seen A LOT of reviews complaining about how huge these cards are, and yes they are taller/longer than the reference/founders edition and a lot of other aftermarket cards, but I've put this card in almost a dozen different cases testing different configs/builds, and I've not run into any clearance issue.  All the reviews of people complaining about the cards not fitting there case are people using old cases and/or TINY mini ITX cases that are clearly not meant to fit a big card like that.  Seriously, if you're dropping $300-700 ($300 for the 1060 Strix all the way up to $700 for the 1080 strix) then spend another $60 to but a case that was made in the last couple years that won't have clearance issues with modern large GPU's...  Don't complain that your 10 year old case won't fit a card like this when graphics cards were not this big when that case was made.It seems like with each generation of cards there is one manufacturer that really stands out from the rest as far as overall quality.  With the Maxwell cards I really think that EVGA stood out among the rest, but I think they came up short this generation with the Pascal cards.  I really do think that Asus did something really great with these Strix Pascal cards.  I actually had an Asus 980ti Matrix Platinum for a couple months, that thing was a work of art!  It was like I had a Lamborghini in my PC!  But it was so huge/heavy that it had terrible GPU sag, after only a few days it was sagging so bad I was legit worried about damage to the PCI-E slot."", 'Not talking about technical data, hundreds of reviews. For my needs it does a good job. The only issue is that the fan gets to loud when temperature raises and the humming it produces it’s a bit irritating. My solution to this problem was to move the CPU a bit farther from the working area.', 'Good', ""It is what it state's"", 'Firstly, because Amazon groups like items which is a total failure to separate gleaning issues of one item to another, I will state that this is for the ASUS GeForce GTX 1070 8GB ROG STRIX OC Edition Graphic Card.I usually build my gaming rigs with semi-stupid in mind; great hardware, but not paying the dumb highline prices of the top dawg on the market. usually 1 or two down, depending on what it is. My rigs was a bit old at:Coolermaster HAF towerintel I7 3930k 6 core cpu3 x Nvidia GTX680OC - MSI32gb g-skill ripjaws DDR3-192002 x Samsung Evo 840 SSd\'smultiple storage disks blah blah blahThe issue was that I was really pushing these cards I had in and the timing was not working well against the timing of new I7 chips and boards for me to justify the whole upgrade. I decided to drop the third card since these new cards had the Display port, hdmi and dvi i needed to run my 5 screens. This dropping of the third card also took care of some heat; the cards were stressing to play some of the newer games and thus pulling some juice to keep up.Popped these cards in and WOW. I always love that pretty feeling when you start stressing the cards to the edge and you just see some pretty numbers. My cpu and all other components stayed the same and I am now able to play everything like before but no 4000db fan noise, less heat, better graphics quality and better interfacing to my screens with the display ports.NOTE: These cards are huge and the twin frozr MSI cards i took out were not small. If these guys keep up with near stupid video card sizing scheme, we will have to get an accessory slave board and house them separately. I had to take off the fan shroud on the inside of the side panel to make it fit and they barely fit on the end next to all the on board connections for the sata ports and hard drive cage.when I upgrade my board and cpu, memory and such next year, I will have to get measurements on the board to make sure everything fits and if not, buy a new case as well.EnjoyUpdate 12/16/2016: Two days into a bricked card; one of the two cards I ordered just freaked out while opening a web page and blocked the card with the dreaded code 43. After trying every solution known to man I emailed Asus with no reply as of yet. Artifacts in small squares hit the screens that were attached to that card and now it says the card ""has a problem"". We will see how Asus deals with this issue. I do not run two cards for sli purposes, I run two cards because I have that many screens. I have lowered my rating to reflect a product that failed in a very short time. I bought the cards on September 12th, 2016 and installed them when I got home 4 days later.I would also like to add that I was getting artifacts in a couple of games, but on both cards. In Ark, sometimes corpses would stretch to high heaven and you could not tell where the body was actually lying and trees would not render right as well as plants. THAT could be Ark, which is beta but I talk to others that do not see this. Could be Nvidia as a whole.Two cards bought at the same time had complete hardware revision differences. One card was a hardware rev.A1 and the other was a rev.FF. NORMALLY, revisions go in order from A-Z showing changes to the hardware and usually more so firmware. If so, these are two completely different cards.Edit 04/24/2017:I have received a new card from ASUS warranty. NOT ASUS\'s fault on the timing but mine. I travel a lot and sometimes it gets rough getting everything done by priority. I sent it to them, they had it turned around in maybe a week. That was a week while they troubleshoot the thing AND were waiting for replacement parts. They ended up sending a brand new card which is working fine at the moment and the new one came with a slightly newer firmware than the existing good one with Rev A1 as well. I am starting to wonder if GPU-Z was unable to pull the actual revision number of the failed card at all and THAT was why it reported FF. ASUS did give the reasons for failure on the sheets with the card and that is important to me. Not that the part failed, ANYTHING can have failure as nothing is perfect. I want to know that there is not a serial problem with something I bought and one quick way to find out is a manufacturer NOT telling you why it broke. My issues was a failed hardware memory issue.Cudos for the quick replacement ASUS, well done.']"

This phenomenon does not occur permanently and can occur particularly when starting up video games.Another big plus of the ASUS DUAL RTX 4070 is the very low power consumption of this graphics card, which makes it one of the leaders in this regard, so it can reduce the electricity costs in your own household to a certain extent thanks to its low consumption.The conclusion:The ASUS DUAL RTX 4070 12 GB graphics card stands out very positively, especially with activated DLSS3, with which you can increase video games beyond twice the FPS and that is why this ASUS graphics card can be described as excellent.But the low power consumption of this graphics card is also worth recommending, so the ASUS DUAL RTX 4070 is a graphics card that does everything right in (almost) all points."", ""I upgraded from a GTX 1660 SUPER to this, and comparatively this runs cooler and quieter.

But the real issue is that $600 is a lot of money to spend on a graphics card.If you don't mind being 1-2 generations behind in terms of ray-tracing performance and you don't need CUDA, AMD's 6950 XT and 6800 XT both offer much better price-to-performance in raster gaming and can even beat the 4070 in raw raster performance, all with an extra 4 GB of VRAM. It's not out as of writing this review, but if the 7800/7800 XT has released by the time you're reading this you should take a look at that as well.If you want top-of-the-line RT or need CUDA, this is pretty much the best you'll get without spending another $200 for a 4070 ti (which is even more VRAM limited). But before you buy, make sure to check the competition from team red (or even Intel Arc, though that may be less relevant if you're looking in this price range) to ensure that your requirements really require you to pay the Nvidia tax."", 'Finally upgraded my antiquated GTX 770 to this and it is a huge difference.  Runs cool and pushes a 3440x1440 monitor with no problem.  I have been able to some pretty impressive overclocking results.  Currently running stable at +195 MHz on the core clock and +1200 MHz on the memory clock, but I have been able to pass 3D Mark benchmarks at +270 MHz and +1800 MHz but it is very unstable at these speeds and it was luck of the draw actually completing the benchmark without crashing.Unfortunately there might be some issues with the power draw on these particular ASUS 4070 cards.  From what I have read these should be able to pull over 215 watts by upping the power limit in OC tools like MSI Afterburner.  Upping the wattage should allow for further overclocking, but this card seems to be limited to 200 watts as I have confirmed with my card.  I am uncertain if this is a hardware, bios, or other limitation.  Hopefully this is an issue that can be resolved with some sort of software update from ASUS.  It would be unfortunate if the thermal headroom this cool-running card provides could not be utilized with further overclocking.  If you do not plan on overclocking your card this should not be much concern to you.', '🥰', ""Pros:-It's not huge, so I didn't have to worry about it fitting in my case.-Amazing performance per watt.  Probably the best performing new GPU I could buy without needing to upgrade my 650w PSU-Only one 8-pin PCIe cable required.-DLSS3/Frame Gen is definitely awesome to have and should help extend the life of the card.-Better performance in raytraced games and AI related tasks like Stable Diffusion compared to AMD.-Better performance in 3D applications like Blender compared to AMD.-Cool and quiet.  Peaks at like 65c while gaming and the fans never get loud enough to bother me.  I haven't noticed any coil whine either.-AV1 encoding-Metal backplate.-Looks nice.Cons:-It's not cheap.  But I wouldn't say it's a terrible value either.  Especially when considering the great power efficiency; It could save you a decent amount of money in electricity costs  in the long run vs. some of it's current competitors.Overall, I'm quite happy with this GPU.  It renders all of my games at 1440p ultra very efficiently with high FPS.  However, I can't say I'd recommend it if you're using a card from the previous generation (RTX 3070 or RX 6700xt etc.)  Too much cost for too little gain.  But if you're on something older, like a RTX 2070 or an rx 5700xt...I think it's absolutely a solid buy."", 'Sips power, runs all my games great at 1440p, stable, quiet, up to date feature support.On the downside, pretty expensive for a xx70 card, and minor coil whine, but not really noticeable unless I remove case door or have speakers off/complete silence while running a game.']"

Y un buen detalle es que trae soporte para que no se cuelgue la tarea. 10/10.', 'Plenty of sites have in depth reviews for this card so I would definitely check those to determine if the price/performance is right for you. For me it was nice middle ground between the more budget cards around the $800 msrp (board component quality, generous power limit adjustment) and the ""high-end"" cards that are in excess of $900 that really don\'t offer any tangible performance gains (just a more ""gamery"" look that I am not fond of). Just wanted to mention a couple of things regarding quality of life issues that I\'ve faced so far.The main thing that you should be aware of when buying the Gigabyte OC model is that the RGB lights on the fans (not the gigabyte logo) are only illuminated when the fans are spinning. So if you enjoy the RGB lightshow when not gaming I would avoid this card or set a manual fan curve that disables the zero-rpm mode. This is a bit unfortunate as you shouldn\'t have to choose between lights and silent operation when not gaming. BTW this is mentioned in the techpowerup review so the card is definitely working as intended and my unit is not faulty. I personally don\'t care much about RGB so I just disabled the fan lights with RGB Fusion and left the the gigabyte logo light on (which always stays illuminated). Additionally, the lights from the fans shine through the area where the 16pin power connector is which produces a bit of a strobe effect as the fans spin when looking at the back of the card. Kind of annoying to look at if your card is mounted horizontally but probably a non-issue for vertical mounting.In short, if you\'re an RGB enthusiast I\'d look elsewhere. No reason to make quality of life sacrifices regarding the fans with such an expensive card.The sag support bracket is a nice addition and is easy enough to install. For some reason the instructions only tell you to attach one screw to the GPU directly but there are three mounting holes and three corresponding screws included in the package. I just installed all three as the bracket seemed a little loose with just one. On my motherboard (Gigabyte X570 Aorus Elite Wifi) the front panel USB-C connector is right next to the top mounting point for the bracket (towards the back of the board). Unfortunately the case connector is a right angle type (o11 dynamic) so the sag support blocks it. Worth taking a look at your board to see if you need an adapter for your front panel connector (to straight instead of right angle) or you might want to consider getting an aftermarket support bracket that doesn\'t have a clearance issue.', ""This is a very powerful yet silent card with incredibly low power usage for it's performance. 100% recommended. I just wish it had at least 16 Gb of vram but at the moment 12gb are more than enough for my needs! (gaming at Ultrawide 1440p (110fps+) and rendering videos on After Effects).I've had a few gigabyte cards in the past and they never fail to deliver. I had some trouble mounting the support included for the card, which it definitely needs given its weight. Nothing major though, just make sure your case has enough clearance to fit not only the card but also the support, or get a different one that adjusts to your case and you should be good to go!"", 'La tarjeta esta wena, puedo wachar mis monas chi1chnas a full HD 4K 360 HZ mientras estoy carreando en paladins. 20 de 10 y godd.comprala esta chida, muy fresca, si te gustan grandes pues compra un gab grande igual pq esta mide unos 31 CM.El RGB esta pal prro, da igual.los fans los enciende cuando tiene mucha carga en la gpu, si namas estas jugando PVZ esa cosa no va a sudar.Obviamente esta tarjeta es para jugar a 1440p.ByebesitosSi sale algo mal pues estara aqui.22/07/23.

ASKの国内ユーザーサポートと国内3年保証が付いてきます=================================1.について海外レビューなどでPNYの4070TiのOC版の静音性の評価が高いですが、それはヒートシンクとファン(10cmx3個)が馬鹿でかいから。私はOC版を買いまして、ケースに入れず机上で試運転させたところフルロードでもファンは最低回転数である1,200rpmで65度前後を維持、ほぼ無音です。なお温度が低いときはファンは完全停止します。1,300rpmを超えるとやや音が聞こえ始めて、1,500rpmまでなら許容範囲。ケースに入れれば温度は上がるはずですが遮音されるのでもう少し回っても大丈夫でしょう。1,800rpmを超えると明らかにファンの音が聞こえます。ちなみに風切り音は甲高いシューではなくそれより低めのフォー。なお最大回転数は3,100rpm。もちろんOCゆえに温度が高い可能性もありますが、国内のレビューを見ていると、ノーマル版のファン回転数はOC版の+200～300rpmっぽいので、おそらくOC版の方が静かなんじゃないかと思いOC版を買いました。2.について2023年8月現在、性能のわりに高いと不人気だった4070の価格がこなれてきていますが、私はWQHD144Hzのモニタを使用しているので4070Tiを買ってよかったです。4070だと力不足になっていた可能性が高いです。価格が下がったとはいえ4070も8～9万円するので、それで不足する恐れがあるなら、保険として+2～3万円だして4070Tiを買っていた方が安全です。', 'A placa é ótima, muito fria e bonita.

If you buy I would recommend not changing or installing rgb software unless you want rgb off or default out the box. 4/5 just because of this issue that Zotac has yet to fix because apparently it was an issue with the 30 series launch too.', 'Card works great, performance is amazing, and the cooling is top tier. Just be aware that the RGB LIGHTING CANNOT BE CONTROLLED without their Firestorm program. An update recently went out that caused the software for the lighting to not work for the RTX 4000 series… it can be avoided by not installing the Firestorm firmware update until it has been fixed… also they have already said publicly that they do not know when this will be fixed… so if you like the default lighting it’s okay. Supposedly they had the same issue with the RTX 3000 series as well.Also inserting the RGB cable is so annoying not sure why they didn’t place it on the side instead of in between the coils towards the center of the card where you can barely fit it in, you have to use a tiny screw driver to push it in (or disassemble the top plate where it is screwed down on opposite sides. The screws under the top plate are at an angle next to the coils so you may need to disassemble the bottom to reach these carefully).With that being said I returned my Zotac 4070ti, although the issue is small, I feel like if I pay this amount of money I expect it to work properly without the need of having to trouble shoot (which is what Zotac has advised different people with the RTX 4000 series) and wait for a fix from Zotac. I ended up going with a different brand.', ""After upgrading to a 4k monitor I have been needing to upgrade my GPU.  The 3070 is ok at 4k but compromises have to be made. I waited through the crypto nonsense as I was not gonna succumb to the scalpers and over pricing of the 3080, and 3090. At an 800 dollar or around price point this card gives you essentially 3090 performance. If you look at it in those terms yes its worth it.The Zotac AMP Extreme AIRO version is a decidedly unique iteration of the 4070 Ti. It is HUGE.  It barely fits in my case.  It is quiet and efficient surprisingly for such a tremendous card.  Nice vapor chamber and monstrous heatsink are included. It is heavy on the RGB which isn't  a big want  for me but I have to say it has grown on me.I never had a Zotac GPU but count me in as a fan.  Its boost clock factory overclock hits 2700MHz.

I would recommend this to anyone who has any 4K screen and wants to run the best games on it. It doesn’t require a new PSU to run and that makes it a great value for existing upgradesHowever.. that is the distinction. For VR this card is just not up to the highest end usages like latest headsets and flight sims,etc. you definitely hit its limitations on VRAM and memory-bus when doing the dual high-resolution outputs of VR. It still runs almost all of that really well too, but be advised, the much pricier and power-hungry 4090 has its fit there.', 'This is my 1st PC build. I wanted something powerful yet efficient. Bought this 3 weeks ago and have played your typical Warzone & Halo along with some simulation. Works flawless, holds constant 155+ FPSIt’s a wonderful GPU. Adjusted RGB to match all white RGB theme. I highly recommend this.', 'While gaming and watching YouTube, the fans are at 30% and the HOTSPOT is 49*c.

After about 1 hour of playing around with the connections, the card would only ever show 2 monitors at most. Contacted the manufacturer, who told me to re-install the drivers, format my computer and re-install the drivers again. After doing of that it still wouldn't work properly. Customer support hinted to me that 2 monitors were plenty, and I knew it was time to send it back; but was informed by customer support that it needed to be returned to seller, so I am sending it back.Pros:  Amazon support and return policy.

I have this card running my whole Adobe suite, Davinci Resolve and Blender and it just smokes through everything.You absolutely need a motherboard and processor that has a Rebar option to take advantage of it's power or this card will NOT work. Z690 or Z790 and a 12th or 13th gen Intel is the ideal setup so you can also use the Deep Link technology.

Key takeaways for this TUF variant are that it performs as advertised, is very large and runs relatively cool. Replaced a 10GB 3080, hesitantly, to take full advantage of the 5k+ resolution of a new VR headset. The 3080 just didn\'t have the stomach for those resolutions. This card pushes 3300x3300 (per eye!) without breaking a sweat in the racing sims and roomscale experiences I\'ve thrown at it. It\'s almost comical just how much memory and how powerful this GPU has and is.Things to be aware of:- Power requirement. You need 600W dedicated purely to this card if you want to make full use of its potential. That includes 4 SEPARATE dedicated 8-pin PCIe connectors running from your ATX 2.0 PSU\'s VGA/PCIe/CPU outputs to the 12VHPWR connector that comes with the card. Alternatively, newer ATX 3.0 PSUs come with the 12VHPWR standard, I believe. I went ahead and upgraded to a 1000w gold PSU. 850w minimum spec made me nervous with OC\'d CPU and all other cards/USB devices considered.- It\'s huge. It\'s ""check your available internal case dimensions"" levels of huge. Specifically length and height (amount of PCIe slots) are the likely largest concerns, but if you have a slim case, you need to check that too.- It\'s heavy. Thankfully it comes with a support that works very well. Once in place, there is no concern about the load being put on the PCIe slot.- It can get noisy when hot enough for the fans to start ramping up. There is definitely a little coil whine, but I run my case fans relatively high to begin with and am not noticing it any more than I did with my TUF 3080. Those who like dead-silent systems may want to look elsewhere, but I really think the issue is overblown unless my experience is the exception.- It runs surprisingly cool, even with low fan speed. My case is not spacious, but I have not seen a rise in CPU, motherboard or RAM temps compared to having the 3080 in there.- It can easily outpace single-core performance on a majority of CPUs out there. Beware that any CPU bottlenecks will become immediately evident. I\'ve noticed walls that didn\'t exist before since the GPU can now handle all display demands at 60% power when unoptimized/single-core heavy sims hit the wall with my aging 10700k at 5ghz.I feel a bit ridiculous being a proponent of an $1,800 GPU, but times have changed. 5k+ resolution HMDs now exist. Triple screen 4k performance is a real thing for others. I would not consider buying this GPU if it weren\'t for a very specific need of mine, but it\'s good to know that GPU performance will never be a concern in the foreseeable future and I can focus on eventually updating to a new socket, CPU and DDR5 when it becomes necessary.', 'Loud coil whine, but performs as expected when not stuttering.', 'Title: Unleash Gaming Greatness - The Impressive GeForce RTX® 4090 OC Edition Graphics CardRating: ★★★★★ (5/5)Prepare to be blown away by the sheer power and innovation of the GeForce RTX® 4090 OC Edition Gaming Graphics Card.

Because of the metal slot on this board, GPU does not sag at all even though it's quite heavy, once the slot part is screwed in.Got around 34,700 in cinebench 2024 gpu test. More than double my old 3080's 14,400.Only using 3 PCI-E 8 pin connectors, card only drew 260 watts max in cinebench 2024 gpu test, 3 connectors gets you 450 watts. 4 pins gets you 600 watts and is only needed for (extreme?) overclocking.Paired with a 13900KS, it got 90 fps in starfield in the cities, 1440p ultra no downscaling/fsr, depending on area. I thought I was happy with my 55 fps I was getting on my old 3080, the experience was miles better getting 90 fps in the cities. This gpu gets around 150 fps in interiors.Great card I would recommend it. I gave it 5 stars, except 4/5 on price, 1700 is a bit much, but if you can afford it and gaming is your passion, I would definitely get it."", 'I\'m upgrading from a ASUS ROG Strix 1080ti so I have very little frame of reference for performance for a modern 30/40 series Nvidia gpu, but from the few benchmarks I\'ve run and the gaming tests I\'ve done so far this card is beastly. It\'s going to sound stupid, but basically since Skyrim was released my go to metric for raw performance has been can it run ultra-modded Skyrim smoothly (""ultra-modded"" has changed a lot over the years so the metric stayed relevant for me). Yes Skyrim is a 12 year old game, but when you get enough texture mods combined with an ENB and such it can be quite demanding. With my standard ultra-modded install I was getting like 40fps fairly consistently on the 1080ti but there were still dips in certain areas, this card is locked at a rock solid 60fps (capped due to engine limitations) and it\'s barely breaking a sweat, highest usage I saw was 51% usage in the most demanding spot I know to test ingame (would occasionally cause a crash even on the 1080ti and the 1080ti was constantly pinned at 100% usage). I swear I\'ve never had such a jump in performance from a single upgrade, granted I skipped 2 generations this time, but even still. Time to go do an obligatory Cyberpunk playthrough with settings cranked I guess. To be clear I bought this card specifically for its AI performance and VRAM for locally running large language models and stable diffusion, but now I\'m geeking out over the raw speed of this card so I guess some gaming is in order.Specifically regarding the ASUS TUF branding, it\'s a solid well built card. The metal shroud gives the card a lot of rigidity and the recessed 12vhpwr plug is nice for helping to avoid putting strain on the connector which has been a problem with other cards. This card is absolutely massive, so build accordingly. Their little support bracket to keep the card from sagging is a high quality machined aluminum part (although it barely fit above the tower basement in my Enthoo Evolv case even at its lowest setting). Thermals have been good so far, haven\'t seen it top 70 C yet at stock speeds. At stock the card pulls about 500W peak so make sure you have a beefy PSU.I\'ll be the first to say that if you\'re running a 1440p monitor (or lower) this card is absolutely overkill (probably my next upgrade) for gaming in basically any title, if you know you need this power for something specific, pick it up, but if not there are much better price/performance options.', 'I am playing red dead redemption 2, cyberpunk 2077 and gta 5 at 4K ultra everything over 144 fps most of the time and never below 100fps in any of this games without breaking a sweat.

I paid $2150 for a $1700 MSRP variant Zotac Trinity OC edition 4090, yet I held out and waited for an RTX 3080 for almost a year after its initial release to find some sort of \'good deal\' and never even considered the 3090/Ti series. The reason is because the pricepoints to performance almost never make sense in the flagship x090 series, they\'re always just marginal bumps over the mainstream x080 (or x070) series for astronomically higher prices. The 4090 is different though. This thing is ~50% more powerful than the to-be-released 4080, and trumps the 3090Ti over 2:1 in many cases.Plus you get the added luxury of its expansive 24GB of VRAM (My 3080\'s bottleneck was always that, I had a 10GB card and stuttering/detail settings had to stay stuck to where I wouldn\'t exceed the 10GB limit- people may say ""even 10GB is overkill!"", well play any modern title on \'Ultra\' at high resolutions (1440P and above)+keep a sensor on your VRAM consumption and you\'ll see how important that factor actually is (and how quickly it hits capacity in many, many games).My first Zotac was an RTX 2070 and I was pleasantly surprised by how stable and plug&play it was vs some of the competition with proprietary management software and weird, glitchy gimmicks (such as the Aorus Master series that has a really cool-in-concept LCD panel on the heatsink, but is a nightmare to maintain and keep animating/showing sensor info reliably). Just stick it in, and it does what it says on the tin perfectly. And I actually use Zotac Firestorm (their overclock utility) universally with all my GPUs now, it\'s my overclocking tool of choice (used to be MSI Afterburner but Zotac is just more to-the-point and aesthetically pleasing), so from their HW to their SW this is one great GPU vendor.So this 4090 looked like a strong contender for a solid launch 4090, and I can happily confirm it sure is now owning one. Everyone knows about the power of the 4090, I don\'t need to go into details there. But again, coming from my 3080, that VRAM bump along with the incredible Raytracing horsepower bump too, has let me go through every laggy/stuttery/low fps scene in every game I took note of (like indoor clubs in Cyberpunk 2077, heavy campaign scenes in MW2, overall performance in BF2042, etc) and runs it all like butter now.If you were willing to shell out $2k+ (even $3k at a point) for the 3000 series, or you were hesitant to ever get flagship GPU models because of their skewed value:performance ratio, this card has bucked both those trends entirely now. The value is unbeatable even if the pricepoint is eyewatering. We\'re no longer in the 1st gen Raytracing era, so there\'s really not a lot of risk being an early adopter like there was with the comparably anemic 2000 series when it first came out. If you can budget for this card, you should grab it.', 'Upgraded from an ROG STRIX 2080ti to this and a 13900k, and the performance bump is massive. Where previously I was hitting 40-45FPS with Raytracing on and High settings in games like Darktide at 3440x1440, I now hold at between 110-120FPS, with 1% lows of 80FPS, maxing out every setting. It is a brute force monster--games with complaints about poorly optimized performance will cause you no grief. Redfall hovers at 100FPS with every setting maxed. Fallen Order is at 80+. Atomic Heart is over 150.The cooler performs extremely well, rarely being audible over the sound of my case fans. At 99% GPU utilization, 80% VRAM consumption, and fans at 100%, GPU package temp maxes out at 85C, with VRAM modules usually being about 10C above package.I have two complaints about this card, and they are very minor. The first is that the ""octopus"" cable that\'s included is pretty short. I\'d have liked to hide the 4-into-1 spaghetti mess inside the PSU shroud of my case, rather than have that be so visible. If you have a PSU with the dedicated 12+4 connector, or don\'t mind your cable management as much, it\'ll be a non-issue.The other is with the card\'s RGB. The Spectra RGB system Zotac uses requires an additional connection, rather than being managed through the PCI lane. Unlike ROG\'s cards, you\'ll need to connect this to a board header to get control of the onboard RGB, including turning it off. Otherwise, it remains ""PC Blue,"" which may clash with your color scheme if that\'s a priority.Overall a great buy, and expect years of ""Max Settings"" gaming out of this card before it feels the pinch.', ""It is as advertised, but is not as feature rich as other cards. Zotac refuses to open up the tuning software with any kind of SDK so you can't really sync the RGB with the rest of your machine unless you leave it a static color."", ""This card is a bit pricey at the moment but in -line with current market. If you can wait you should.Performance boost over my previous AMD RX 6900 XT is marginal, but I had some diver issues with the AMD card. I also had driver issues with a 3090 OC card which is why I choose to give the 4090 a try.I still get some black screen issues with the graphics driver when my system comes out of sleep mode but a quick Crtl+Win+Shift+B resets the driver and takes care of the issue.I primarily went with this card for the VRam as I am working with AI models locally that require a large amount of VRam and Nvidia cards to run smoothly. The modeling performance increase is significant over the 3090.For gaming my CPU which is a AMD Ryzen 9 3950X is now the bottle neck of the system. I've pushed this graphic card to its limit and the heat and noise levels stay within the thresholds I have set without issue. This card is substantially quieter than the founders edition, and I have had no issues with the power connector heating up or melting as some cards and cables have been know to do."", 'The card worked great, but it would not fit without removing both sets of HDD racks and I want my hard drives so that was unacceptable. I needed at least 2 more inches to make it fit.', ""Love the zotac 4090 oc. Only con is there is definitely gpu sag compared to no sag of the evga 3090 ti. The included gpu stand to prevent sag was useless to me because the flat area that supports the gpu only fits on areas that aren't flat so it just slides off or if i got it to stay it was rubbing the fans. I did buy a separate brand arm style support that screws in the pcie screw holes and worked great for $15 extra bucks. Overall i miss the evga brand but this has performed great."", 'I ordered this item and paid waaay above MSRP, so I thought that this seller might be some kind of fly by night outfit.  A good price was offered at the time, although not so good as to cause me to be concerned about the price being ""too good to be true."" The price offered at the time of my order is irrelevant, as I am sure that in this crazy market for GPUs prices fluctuate daily. What is important to know is that my order was processed and mailed efficiently and timely.  I ordered the item on Black Friday, and received it in 6 days.  The GPU arrived undamaged and factory sealed.  I plugged it in and it worked.  I have only had a chance to update drivers and register with Zotac online so far, but I thought that I\'d share that this seller appears to be legit and service was good.', 'Have had several Zotac cards now and they always deliver. well made nice looking high performing and well packaged.']"

Leistungsmäßig ist es fast egal, welche RTX4090 man nun kauft, letzten Endes unterscheiden sie sich nur marginal. Ggf. für Overclocking müsste man noch mal genauer schauen, aber auch dieses Modell hier lässt sich noch tunen.Beim Auspacken erstmal ein kleiner Wermutstropfen, im Karton ist die Karte (ach!), eine kürzeste Kurzanleitung, ein Strom-Adapterkabel 4->1 sowie zusätzliches Befestigungsmaterial. Die Software muss heruntergeladen werden (aber nicht unbedingt erforderlich). Das ist schon ein wenig sparsam für eine so teure Karte. Es fehlt meiner Ansicht nach eine externe Stütze, wie sie z.B. MSI bei den Top-Karten beilegt, gibt es aber für kleines Geld hier bei Amazon. Die Stützhilfe von PNY, die am Mainboard zu verschrauben ist, habe ich nicht verwendet. Ich habe die PNY mit einem Adapterkabel von be quiet! angeschlossen, da ich ein be quiet! 850 Watt-Netzteil nutze. Für den Anschluss des Stromkabels sollte man ein ausreichend großes Gehäuse haben, damit das Kabel an der Seitenwand nicht zu stark gekrümmt werden muss. Auf einen korrekten Sitz (vollständig eingerastet ohne Spalt!) beim Stromstecker achten, sind ja schon ein paar Kabel abgeschmurgelt und es soll wohl am falschen Anschluss gelegen haben.Installation ist super einfach, falls schon ein Nvidia-Treiber werkelt (bei mir war es von einer RTX 3090), läuft sie sofort. Und zwar schnell. Verdammt schnell. Bei RDR2 mit allen Einstellungen auf Ultra/4K bleiben sogar die Lüfter der RTX bei 30% (das ist das Minimum) und unhörbar. Scheint sich fast zu langweilen. Bei MSFS habe ich einen erheblichen Frame-Schub bekommen, sowohl in 4K als auch in VR. Dabei laufe ich derzeit anscheinend sogar in eine CPU-Begrenzung hinein (AMD Ryzen 9 5950X).Ich habe die Karte für einen ""akzeptablen"" Preis erhalten. Damit meine ich Verkauf und Versand von Amazon zur nahezu UVP. Dass 2K Euro für eine Grafikkarte natürlich Wahnsinn sind, ist klar, aber manchmal sind Gamer halt auch wahnsinnig. Würde ich nicht viel in VR spielen, hätte ich nicht von einer RTX 3090 auf diese 4090 aufgerüstet, aber der Leistungszuwachs ist immens.Bitte nur nach Möglichkeit nicht diese Scalper unterstützen, die hier teilweise für um die 3.000 € diese Karte verkloppen wollen.', ""I play games and edit videos for YouTube.  I wanted to upgrade my graphics card, but didn't want to overhaul my whole system as i have a 750w psu.  Previously, i had a 3080.  For those in similar situations as me, i find 750w is perfect.  Keep in mind, you will need to get an extra cable if you are using an sfx 750w psu like i am.  i use the corsair gen 5 12vhpwr 600w cable and have had no problems for a few months now.  I pair this 4090 with a 5950x cpu.  At 1440p, i get high framerates (130+) on graphic intensive games like ARK survival evolved.  Additionally, my temps are low (45 degrees) which makes for a very quiet gpu.  I have yet to fame at 4k, but the quiet noise paired with way higher fps already makes it worth it for me.  No game has struggled whatsoever.The main usage for me is editing.  As for video editing, i use davinci resolve and render times are unbelievably fast.

However, compared to other 4090 on \'3Dmark: Time Spy Extreme & Speed Way,\' this GPU is down around 6% at based clocks. I checked the temps, and everything is good: temps below 70c without any mods during winter in a well-ventilated area. Furthermore, I decided to overclock this GPU and its voltage lock, and I could only push another 4% - 5%. I could get the gap to 99% - 100% with the other 4090s, according to 3D Mark. I even made a custom loop: I got a better temperature below 60c and small bumping clocks. However, I was still left with undesirable performance. Soon I will receive my new 4090 ""supreme,"" and I will update this accordingly after some time with it. In conclusion, this card has been a mixed bag, and you might be overpaying for an expected performance that\'s mostly there.', ""If you value silence, this is an amazing card.This is the third 4090 that I've tried. Previously I purchased an ASUS TUF Gaming 4090 which had absurd coil while and screeched unbearably under any amount of load so I returned it. This was followed by a MSI Gaming Trio 4090 which, while better than the ASUS card, still exhibited ridiculous coil whine when under high load and so it too was returned. I had read online that this was the card to get for no coil whine, and that is definitely the case. Imperceptible coil whine at any load. This combined with the quiet fans makes this one of the best 4090s if you're like me and need silence.The quality and construction of the card seems adequate. The packaging seems somewhat lacking for such an expensive card, but it was sufficient to protect my card. There seems to be a common issues of only 2/3 fans spinning, however my card does not have this issue. I've owned one previous PNY card (GTX 560 Ti) which required RMA and the process was relatively painless. So I feel confident in this card over some of the better known brands."", 'Highly Recommend This GPU XLR8 PNY 4090 For Everything Its A Monster']"

If you judge it for what it is - and not what it could have been if AMD tried harder - it's arguably the overall best choice in a new budget card and/or if looking for lower power consumption. It is a sad commentary on the state of budget cards that this counts as probably the best.  But there simply is no competition in this segment. Nvidia has done a new budget card in 5-6 years.As far as 3D (games) performance goes this card is about as fast as Nvidia's GTX 1060 and AMD's Radeon 570/580 . Cards released in 2016/2017.  The GTX 1650 (released 2019) is a bit slower but if you search you can find versions of that card that can run on the PCIe bus alone - no extra power cable needed. Appealing if upgrading an older computer with a modest power supply.My primary goal was finding the overall best combination of low power draw and still decent performance.  The RX 580 can be had new here on Amazon for around $110.  Performance is close but it it's rated at 185 watts and under stress pushes 200 watts.  The RX 570 cannot be found new but lots of used on eBay. A claimed 120 watt power draw but they lie.  The real world power consumption is very close to the RX 580.The GTX 1060 is probably faster than any of the other cards I've mentioned (not by much)  but is rated at 180 watts and while a six year old design is still more expensive than any of the cards mentioned, including the RX 6500 XT being reviewed.A few other things. Nvidia cards are well known to stress 3D performance above 2D.  So if you  primarily play games the Nvidia cards are good to look at. But if you are doing a lot of picture editing or content creation, the 2D scores of Nvidia cards are notably lower.  And AMD's cards are well known to suck substantially more power when using a two monitor set up versus a single monitor.  One of the appeals of the RX 6400 and RX 6500 XT - for me - is that power consumption for two monitors remains very reasonable.So anyway.... This card - the RX 6500 XT - is basically the little engine that could. It performs substantially better than you would think looking at the specs.  Yes, only PCIe 4x lanes and running PCI 3 vs PCI 4 lowers performance. Yes, a narrow PCI bus (64 bit) and only 4GBs of memory.  But the memory is extremely fast.  And the clock speed of the GPU itself is extremely high. So if you keep game settings moderate so as to not exceed the 4GB onboard memory, this card delivers.Also of interest is that if your motherboard supports it, you can help this card a lot with faster system memory. Actually, AMD's cards seems especially found of faster memory. I'm running DDR 4 4000MHz memory on PCIe 3.0 and synthetic benchmarks are all 10-15% faster than normal for PCIe 4.0.Power draw - something really important to me just a hobbyist - is also appealing. The smaller brother RX 6400 only draws 53 watts and never needs an extra power connector.  But it has just been cut back to much and is.... well .... not fast. Nvidia's GTX 1650 is rated at 75 watts (maximum for PCIe only) but is difficult to hard to find not requiring an extra power connector.  This card, the RX 6500 XT - is rated at 107 watts and does require an extra six pin power connector. But my on tests using a watt meter (total system draw) and those of professional reviewers all say the same thing.  The RX 6500 XT isn't using a lot of power. Single monitor idle is 2 watts. Dual monitor is 10 watts.  Running games it is rarely above 85 watts and max at 100. Even if your computer is older and power supply low wattage, you can probably get a four to six pin adaptor and run this card.Overall, the card strikes a good balance between price, performance and power consumption. Sure, it would be a lot better card with 6 or 8GB of memory. Or more PCIe lanes and faster bus.  Or both. But then consumers would probably have no reason to purchase the more expensive (and still a great value) RX 6600.  At least AMD tries to offer a couple of new budget cards. Something Nvidia hasn't bothered with for a long, long time."", 'Está en una poderosisima Dell Optiplex 7010 con un i5 3570, hay un poco de cuello de botella en juegos que requieren mucho cpu, fortnite, FIFA 23, etc, pero a un así van a 60 fps no tan estables pero muy buenos, no he probado warzone por qué se que no abrirá, sin embargo, en una motherboard con PCIE 4.0 acompañado de un mejor procesador, obvio correría a más de 60 fps, en esta PC es imposible pero pensé a futuro y pronto actualizaré a una mejor pc, otro problema aparte del cuello de botella, son las temperaturas, hasta ahora no la he visto a más de 83°c sin embargo, casi siempre está a 75-80°c y es preocupante, cuando actualize a una mejor pc me aseguraré de poner una ventilación formidable, hasta ahora estoy contento con mi compra.', 'Eine richtig gute Grafikkarte für den Preis.

Much has been said about the ""massive"" heatsink but when compared to my Asus Strix 3080 10gb, the Strix is just as tall and actually longer. The FTW3 is thicker but only by 0.5 inch but that does make it a full triple slot card.Inside the box you will receive the monster card itself covered in copious amounts of protective plastic which isn\'t really needed because EVGA does such a bang up job of packaging with firm foam everywhere securely holding this $2200USD behemoth. Also included is a stock little manual EVGA seems to include with all their cards, a support bracket, the ""eLeash"" for suspension support a case badge and of course the 3 PCIe power connector to 1x 12-pin connector that is the future of GPU connectors with the next wave of PSUs.Installation is straight forward and easy and the card is so incredibly well built if you have a strong and well built case you will get zero flex or sag as the card is tank like in nature solid everywhere. If your case has weak bracket support you can use the supporting bracket, eLeash or both. I use a Phanteks case so it has great support and the card required nothing to stay centered and solid. I love that EVGA put the power connector on the end of the card. It makes for nicer and tidier cable management.I tested it on both Windows 10 and Windows 11 and it works no problem but you will need to download the newest drivers.As for performance, it is there but compared to my 3080 10gb the uplift is ho hum at best. Timespy was ~22k vs ~18k for my 3080 10gb. I play WoW 4k Ultra 10 RT on and outside of a few spots where my FPS dip the 3090ti provided a solid uplift (54fps vs 68fps) but nothing that is going to be a major game changer. In areas where I was getting 100-110fps I would then get 130-140fps.Temperatures were fantastic for a card of this power output. Playing WoW for a few hours or even running Timespy temps didn\'t break 65c. This is a testament to EVGA and their absolutely lights out air cooler and design. Clocks when gaming boosted to ~2070mhz at stock since the card was able to keep temps so nice.Zero coil whine. Even when running Timespy or using EVGA\'s software to up the clocks the card had no coil whine or the fans were loud enough to drown out any minor whine. Using Precision, clocks held steady at 2160mhz stress testing and 2175mhz gaming. Definitely not worth it for the noise and heat that it generated for that extra ~105mhz.If you have a 3080 / 6800xt or greater the price:performance of the 3090ti is pretty terrible. With next gen cards arriving within the year, it is better to wait.My main issues are three fold and why I returned it:Heat:I have never had a card heat up my modest sized (12\' x 10\') computer room so fast. Within 1hr of playing my room was noticeably warmer. I took the glass window off my desktop PC just to feel and the 3090ti was sitting in there like a mini furnace spewing heat everywhere with a passion while pulling ~435w+. My 3080 pulls around 317w and that 118w difference is a game changer. Within 2hrs of playing even with the door open I had to call it quits and physically fan my door to get it cooler in there. I would need a small AC unit in my computer room to combat that heat output over time. I usually play with my door closed but had to leave it open to reduce the sauna like atmosphere. This was with my central AC ON. I loathe to think what it would be like in the summer. If you plan on using EVGA\'s Precision software to push this card to the max be prepared to have a bag of marshmallows to roast over the figurative open flame that will be your GPU under load.Noise:I was hoping along with a modest performance bump that by locking my frame rate to ~60fps I would get a slight noise reduction with that monster heatsink. Nope. Instead, I received the exact opposite. As soon as I stepped foot into the new content areas of WoW Shadowlands that are graphically demanding the fans immediately kicked up and were quite audible. They were much louder than my Strix fans which are close to inaudible at the same settings with the frame rate capped at 60fps which I was not expecting as they weren\'t even on high but we are talking an increase of over 25% in wattage so it makes sense. I\'ve included a video of the fans in action. Yes, that noise you hear are the GPU fans in action.Price:performance:$2200USD (Currently $2000USD) is just not worth the uptick in performance along with the noise and heat over even a 3080 10gb. On paper and reading reviews it looks like something major but in practical use it just isn\'t there especially if you lock your frames and just want consistency. Of course if you do high refresh gaming and want the absolute highest max frames at all times then this card might make sense to you.Summary:In summary, if you are looking for the BEST 3090ti air cooled model on the market this is it. This is easily the best built, air cooled GPU I\'ve ever held. It is built like a tank and manages to keep temps in the 65c range even under load. Because of the excellent air cooler, the card was able to boost to 2070mhz no problem gaming at stock. The only problem was the heat output and noise which there isn\'t much EVGA can do about that because that is the price of taming this expensive beast. Kudos to EVGA for taking everything they could improve upon the original 3090 FTW3 and doing exactly that in every aspect. If you are in the market for a 3090ti and can handle the size, heat, power and price....this is the one for you.5/5 for EVGA maximizing the 3090ti to its full potential....warts and all.', 'Im using evga x1 software to limit power to 70% and its alowing me to game at 4k 60fps cool and quiet with my RM750X.

Grab this while stock lasts if its reduced!', ""I honestly wouldn’t have gotten it for the full MSRP since that pricing was ridiculous and I don’t think it was worth it back then. -Even more so after the launch of the 4090, which is better, but still pretty expensive-.I was lucky enough to grab one of these at a -50% discount (sep 2022) which was an absolute bang for the buck considering the power and capabilities of this card.This was my first ever EVGA product and It honestly took me by surprise. It looks great IMO (I wasn't a big fan of the design when I first saw it announced, but it looks much better in person. The aesthetic with the RGB off is so clean and elegant.The cooling is awesome, it can handle rough games and not exceed +75°C.Also, remember that the 3090ti has been revised and modified to have all the ram modules on the front side again, so it doesn't have that silly 3090 ram overheating issue (something you should consider when buying something this expensive).It doesn’t sag at all since they added support to the bracket and is now pretty sturdy. Something which I am really glad about since I didn’t have to use the e-leash at all.Performance is exactly what I was expecting and I can run pretty much any game at ultra settings on 3440x1440 +120FPS.Note: The box is gargantuan. I had to travel with this GPU and it barely fitted since it was the same size as my carry-on luggage.My case is a Full Tower and this packaging is almost as big as that. (see pics for reference)."", ""This graphics card is amazingly powerful! I play Call of Duty: Warzone a lot and this card can maintain 4k 144hz pretty steadily through most game modes with DLSS turned on and no OC. Of course, this all requires a pretty powerful CPU as well but this review is about the card. I used to own a 3080ti FE that had trouble even with DLSS Ultra Performance on and a pretty significant OC. This card can handle APEX, Hunter: Call of the Wild, and Madden 22 at 4k with max settings with ease. I also stream from my gaming computer and I don't really notice any significant FPS drops when doing so. If you have the money, this card is worth it. I would recommend giving it 3-4 months if possible given that the 4000 series GPUs are going to hit the market and this card is around the same price as the 4090 is rumored to be.Note: This requires a lot of juice. I had to upgrade my PSU to the MSI A1000G to give this card some power wiggle. Again, make sure your case can handle the size of this card. It barely fit in my NZXT H510 mid-tower with a CPU water cooler attached. I had like 1.5 inches of room to spare to fit the power cables for the card. Also, if you have the H510 case, you cannot mount it to the bottom PCI slot. There is not enough room. Again, this card is massive. About 2.5 times the thickness of the 3080ti FE."", ""This card is amazing!  Gaming at 1440p & ultra widescreen (3440 x 1440) I get excellent fps and temps.I originally bought a 3080 ti, but the temps were REALLY high (83-87+ in 20min of gaming in a well cooled case) and the 3080 ti was showing some early signs of artifacting.  So when the price dropped to $1399 on the 3090 ti ftw3 Ultra it was a no-brainer for me.  They moved the ram so in the same case my 3090 ti never goes above 65 degrees and gets even better performance, even with all settings now turned to max.This thing is THICK!  The cooler does it's job very well.  They also got rid of the ugly red line that was on the evga 3080 ti, 3090, etc.  It is a SOLID backplate and is overall built incredibly well.  You likely don't even need a support or weird leash they gave :)Disregard the salty neckbeards on reddit and other social media....If you want an upgrade and have solid cash flow in your life, this is an excellent choice now at the current price of $1399.

I haven't done a direct comparison but my renders are at least 10 times faster and games that I'd been very happy with using the 1080's are clearly much better.  Something I really didn't expect:  my primary SSD (980 Pro) used to always run on the borderline of being too hot, sometimes pushing upward of 60 degrees c! FAR above the 50 degree recommended threshold.  With the 3090, it's been staying pretty steadily at 46 degrees.I may regret not holding out for the 4090 Ti when it eventually releases, but that's just destiny for a computer enthusiast.  It was worth the money (though I am glad I waited until prices dropped back closer to MSRP!)."", 'This card is great looking the memory modules are placed correctly this time(all on one side of the pcb) but under the same hardware and settings it underperformed against my ftw3 3090.1000w psu by the way no overclock in both cases completely stock both running 47-52°c under load.My sample is likely defective in its memory modules for I am also experiencing early signs of artifacting on games like warzone and stuttering game play on Gears.Hope to rma soon and get a good sample for I would like to water block it after I am sure its a good sample keep it for the next 5 years.']"

And fans are quiet at 60% and no coil whine. Best card I've ever owned. 1yr and going strong."", ""This is a very good card and at stock settings lines up nicely with all RTX 3080 benchmarks you can find online.Its price is higher than average but this is largely due to the addition of RGB. If you're on a budget it's worth saving 100 dollars on a non-RGB card if you can and don't care about lighting effects.Operating temperatures with my custom fan curve tend to be 45C at idle and 70C at full load with my modest overclock and no undervolting. This is very good for the power draw this card has, so it is a big plus.This card seems to overclock well considering it can't be pushed past 102% power draw in MSI Afterburner. I'm able to have a stable +120 on the core and +600 on the memory, which isn't far off from what the cards that can do 115-120% power draw are able to hit. (Note: Please remember to consult guides and videos on overclocking before attempting to do so yourself.)The card requires 3 8-pin connectors. A very large amount of power supplies, both OEM and aftermarket, do not have 3 of them by default (my Corsair RM850x for example only includes 2 8-pin cables), so if you have a modular PSU you'll want to buy an extra 8-pin PCIe cable that matches your power supply's manufacturer. Even though they often have multiple 8-pin connectors on one cable, you CAN NOT use the same cable for multiple slots. I recommend CableMod's cables as they're good quality and look pretty nice, albeit at a bit of a price premium. Just make 100% sure you buy the cable that matches your PSU. You can NOT use a cable intended for a Corsair power supply on a EVGA power supply or etc.The fans have a minimum operating speed of 30%, meaning you can't turn them off for a 0-noise experience when the system is at idle or under very light loads. MSI Afterburner's override setting didn't change this. I'm not a maniac about the noise of my system and with it only 3 feet from my head I can't hear my PC at full load with headphones on while in-game, so this isn't an issue for me or most people.All in all this is a very good RTX 3080 and I recommend it for anyone who feels it's time to upgrade. The 4000 series of GPU's is coming soon, but I'm willing to bet it will be months if not a full year before they're readily in-stock at anywhere near MSRP pricing given how rampant price gouging and scalping has become for PC components."", ""I had to upgrade to this video card because I had purchased an MSI AMD RX 5700XT believing AMD statement that the 5000 series cards would allow for raytracing with a simple software upgrade to unlock the hardware.As it turns out, AMD lied and the card was never unlocked for raytracing. The issue was price gouging due to crypto mining.Needless to say, I had to wait for prices to drop to purchase this card.I haven't had a single issue with this card and it goes far and above what it is meant to do.Whisper quiet and very powerful.I made sure to get get a model that has a high amount of memory so that I can max out all my settings to 4K and it hasn't failed on anything.  All my games run at ultra settings and I get no less than 60 frames per second."", ""I've used Zotac 970 cards for a very long time as a budget conscious, smaller form factor option. This has been good enough for me as I simply don't have enough time to game to make it worth the cost. Getting hooked on AI art generation, which lead me to Stable Diffusion, while pricing has come to more normal levels, I finally bit the bullet.Stable Diffusion requires at least 8gb Video Memory, and more is better, so this card with 12gb fit well for my interests. I'm happily, and quickly, generating great images and using other GANs to upsize with no issues at all, and I finally have a machine I can play Cyberpunk 2077 on with absolutely no issues. (System specs also include 1tb nvme drive, 32gb ram, i9-9770k cpu.)Absolutely would buy this again."", 'This review has been upgraded from a 4-star review to a 5-star review.I have owned the MSI RTX 3080 for more than one month.  The design is tasteful, and it comes with a support horizontal bracket.  Performance in traditional game titles is excellent and reliable.  Thermal outputs are shockingly low and fans perform quietly throughout.  I am so impressed with MSI cooling technology and shroud design.  Now that the VR stuttering problems have resolved, it is fair to recommend the RTX 3080 12G between $800-1000.  I have extensively put all of my cards to task with Adobe Premiere Pro, Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 077, Halo 4, and Mech Warrior 5.  Goodness!  Graphics look gorgeous, and performance improvements are respectable compared to my GTX 1080 Ti.  In short, the RTX 3080 12G units are worth every penny, and now they finally work in VR!  At $850 for the MSI 12G is a no brainer!  They deserve the highest recommendations.P.S., MSRP has dropped to $799 for the 3080 12G version.  This MSI card, the Aorus Master and the Asus cards being offered between $800-$850 hold my highest recommendations.  I could not perceive any gaming performance differences between this version compared to the 3080 Ti nor the 3090 in 4K gaming.  Hence, I strongly believe that 99% of gamers who operate at or under 4K and 120fps would NOT need anything above this level making the Nvidia RTX 4000 series and AMD RX 7000 series a moot purchase.  With the latter offerings, consumers will have no choice but to upgrade the PC case with a strong airflow design and a new power supply unit (PSU) and the CPU and the motherboard as lower count CPU (fewer than 6 cores) may potentially throttle these cards.  For many users, this essentially requires a new PC build.', 'Poco se puede decir de esta tarjeta grafica no dicho antes. La RTX 3080 es lo mejor para gaming hoy en dia.

Out of the box it draws 100% of power, and 99% of games need that other than Cyberpunk 2077. I limited to 75°C and now it runs completely silent and doesn't heat up my room, all while being about to game at 4k/120 FPS with NVIDIA DLSS enabled.

Solid performance, quiet when it isn’t stressed, good build quality. This thing is tough! My friend dropped it when I was building, and I had trouble getting my graphics card to appear in bios so I reslotted many times, screwed in and out, even almost ripped out the motherboard clamp when installing into a Msi motherboard (first build lol). Just shows MSI’s build quality. However, there were some corners cut in the rgb. Also the card is massive so make sure you get a big enough case and use the included riser so it doesn’t sag too much.Pros:Great performance ~ 140-190 fps in 1440p gamingBuild qualityIt’s a graphics card at a reasonable priceCons:Rgb is horrid. The plastic cover over it is cloudy and when the rgb turns on the hot spots are clear as day.Fans get super noisy under stress, I can hear it with a headset on.Overall, if you find it at a good price, it’s one of the best 3080 cards with a high boost clock out the factory.Update:A month after using, my gpu died randomly. It was the same problem I was having when I first built it, the gpu was not recognized in device manager, nvidia, or in the bios. When it happened the first time, I thought it was my fault… but maybe it’s the Msi gpu or Msi motherboard. Horrible experience. I was just playing valorant with my friends and boom my two monitors say “No input signal”. This gpu was not stressed at all, valorant isn’t intensive even on the highway settings and my fps limit was 190, gpu usage while playing was 30-35%. There was no reason for it to overheat at temperatures were around 58 C. I have no idea what it is and I’m sending my pc to a repair shop to have them test out a different gpu in my system to see if it’s the motherboard or gpu. Even if it is the motherboard, horrible experience from Msi, I don’t know what to say. My integrated graphics on my i7-12700k works just fine and I will be using that until my new motherboard or gpu comes in, and I’m making sure to get asus products. Unbelievable and nightmare experience from a first time builder.Another update: just filed an rma request for my 3080, return time is 15-30 business days… I don’t even know what to say, shipping is paid on my end too. So far the experience left me with 2 sleepless nights, carrying my heavy pc into my car (2 blocks away) down from the 9th floor of my apartment into a pc shop and back up, and 32$ shipping. The reason it’s 32$ is because when I first built the pc and the card didn’t work, I ordered another one from B&H as I was about to return my Amazon one since I thought it was broken and they made me pay shipping as well. The pc shop tested a different gpu and it worked fine, meaning it’s this card specifically. Good one MSI.Final Update (hopefully): I just got my 3080 card back from the repair center, and it works! I can say the RMA service for Msi is okay. I had to call for my package to get scanned and actually worked on and then another to get an update on where my gpu is in the process. It spent a total of about 2 weeks at the center, and 10 days to ship back to me. It was a long process, but it worked. I also sent my gpu with the riser and original packaging and lost both. I got it sent back in a generic white package with padding, no riser or manuals came back to me. This could be my fault since I didn’t read everything on the RMA, but I just sent everything in case I get a replacement. Still annoying, but I’m happy my pc is finally running, if anything else happens I will be sure to update.']"

Card plays PUBG 1440pUltra144, Fornite1440pUltra250+, BF2042 1440Ultra90~. Do not worry if the fans don't spin when you turn your pc on. Mine shipped with a 50C minimum temp to spin the fans. The card isn't terribly heavy, no real need for a support.EDIT: I worry that this card actually fried a PCIE slot on my Z370 Pro4 motherboard. I don't think that board was well suited for a card of this caliber. Z690, in my now current build, works flawlessly.The system sits as a 12700k, 3080 12GB, 32GB of 3200mhz Corsair LPX, Aiza A300 (Lian Li O11 knockoff), EVGA G5 1000W, and MSI 360mm AIO."", ""The cooler on this seems to either be completely off, or at around 40% fan speed where it makes a ton of noise.

The card is very loud and runs very hot, making me need to reconsider my pcie slot usage so I can try to free up more space in front of the fans. And since installing the card I have experienced crashes of games and windows blue screens noticably more frequently than before installation. I even performed a clean install of the drivers to ensure there were no conflicts.

I feel that is overpriced for this cards performance. The Asus construction of this card is supreme and the best on the market second to MSi. I would allways only buy Asus or MSi brand, no others.The build quality of Asus is outstanding. It has the best thermals I have ever seen. On undervolting to 1125 mVolt the core temp in the middle of the card never passes 60 Celsius but stays near it if it draws more watts while gaming. The actual temp (on the edge of the card) is allways around 53 Celsius on gaming load. Somehow the card never runs on it\'s max clock speed but rather howers around 1300 MHz. I believe the card adjusts automatically to the game and my screen refresh which is 1080p and 60 Hz on high settings on the game hovering around 85 to 150 fps.To me for this kind of modern cards thats a bit of an meager performance for an game from 2016 or the game gets allways heavier on the GPU over time as planned obsolescence to force the user to upgrade to an allways more expensive and powerfull card. The graphics on the game I play have improved over time but not that much since till 2019 I was still able to play H&G with an gaming laptop from 2012 with an GT 550M dedicated card and then end of 2019 it just did not work anymore with the GT 550M which had about 6 fps of frames while it got before 30 fps. So end of 2019 I bought an new GT 1030 GDDR5 from MSi which got then 50 fps continuously till today end 2022 when I noticed severe dips of fps when using the scope which dropped it to 28 fps which made the lag really to feel. Actually 2022 the game got more fps on the GT 1030 since it reached often between 40 to 70 fps but sometimes the fps dropped to below 30 fps and that was then not playable anymore. So I ordered now a few months ago the RX 6600 in the hopes I would get about 750 fps to 1000 fps on the game H&G on ultra high but was disappointed when the card reached only constantly a tad over 100 fps reliably and that only on high settings dropping the fps a bit on ultra high. Obviously all fancy graphic correction settings are on off since that would drop the fps further. Radeon Super Resolution (RSR) does not work on that game for some reason.No big deal, it\'s just a game and if the gaming joke becomes to expensive I will just stop gaming alltogether. Screw then the gaming industry when they allways make games more heavy in order to make obsolete the newest, latest and greatest and specially expensiest GPU ever in order to force people to buy the expensive graphic cards every year. At the end I will just leave gaming alltogether.As for now the RX 6600 has an price tag of whooping 350 US$ which is way way overpriced for the performance. The Asus thermal solution on these and overall quality is however second to none and the best in the industry. My MSi GT 1030 reached allways 74 degrees Celsius when not undervolted on the game with medium to low settings but 100% load (2 GB Memory GDDR5) and this Asus RX 6600 does not even reach 60 degrees Celsius. However when it draws 100 Watt it then starts to pass the 70 Celsius mark on the core but not on the edge.Regards gaming with the game Heroes & Generals (the only game I play once in a while) this Asus RX 6600 gets only mediocre performance. I wrote this in an comment in an YouTube Video about that game: ""The RTX 3070 gets around 135 fps on H&G while my RX 6600 does around 110 fps on average depending on the internet speed or something related to online speed (maybe the host server?). The CPU is no where near that important in H&G as the graphic unit. With an octacore 5700G I get between 2% and 4% CPU load and my RX 6600 shows between 30% and 50% load all settings on high and I get between 95 fps and 165 fps hovering mostly around 115 fps depending on internet speed or some internet factors (I use AMD Adrenalin software). With the i3-9100 quad core processor it uses 75% of the CPU (according to MSi Afterburner) and with settings on low for clouds and shadows and medium for objects I get between 30 fps and 65 fps with the GT 1030. So the difference between those 2 GPU is not that big certainly not justifying the price of 210$ and power draw of 80 Watts of the RX 6600 with incredible heat generation as such as it heats up my room uncomfortably much. A GPU acts like an 80+ Watt space heater in the room. The RX 6600 is hovering around 1200 Mhz and 1600 MHz on GPU clock speed and between 30 and 50 Watts sometimes it gets higher and then th fps rise as well. The memory speed of the card is allways at max around 1700 MHz on that game. I undervolted the card to 1125 mVt with it\'s automatic setting. Temps are between 50 and 60 degrees Celsius on the card"".Do not buy the RX 6600 but buy instead the RX 6600 XT for hopefully a bit more performance. Specially do not buy these if they cost over 250$ and you already overpayed when you pay more than 200$ for these. I would price these as 120 MSRP understanding when people pay 150$ for these. But never more. That are good prices. To charge for these 210$ is already theft and frankly usury if they ask an 350$ price for the RX 6600 (non XT). The RX 6600 XT I would appraise for an MSRP of 160$ and the RX 6650 XT I would put an price tag of 190 MSRP on it - not more. That would be honest prices.The RX 6600 I would never buy for 350$ nor past 250$ being aware in the later price I am getting ripped off already.The GT 1030 from MSi I bought end of 2019 new for 79$ and the RX 6600 is not that much more performing in real life on that H&G game as to justify an 200$+ price tag.However the quality and thermal construction of Asus puts off a bit the ripp off and is worth as well a few bucks so I believe I did not to much overpay at 210$ for this card new since it is an Asus.The Asus has an metal backplate which I believe has a few heat transfer patches but not to much of those but it has 3 heat pipes and an massive cooler. The end facing the front fans of the ATX case has an wide open mouth which acts as an wind catcher so the 3 fans I have installed in front blow directly into the cards cooler grid transporting the hot air to the back and exhausting it. However my Arctic F12 and Gamemax 120mm case fans run similarly as the 0 RPM fans of the RX 6600 and start only when the CPU reaches about 50 Celsius and stop at 49 Celsius again. Similar run scheme as the Asus have my 4 case fans (3 in front and 1 in the back). The GPU fans run hardly ever since during gaming the CPU hovers allways arond 64 Celsius keeping the case fans on at about 1000 rpm. The CPU fan is allways on on silence. So the aluminum back plate acts as an heat sink as well in an limited way.If the cards draws 70 Watt the room can be heated up rather quickly since it acts as an space heater. Considered normal space heaters have 2 elements of 1000 Watt or 2 of 700 Watt that means then this card emits 10% of the heat of one 700 Watt heating element of an space heater constantly. It is if you have running in middle of the summer in Miami or Texas, Nevada, Arizona, etc in an room of ambient temp of 30 Celsius an space heater of 70 Watts. The room can fill up with heat rather quickly and in hot zones not even an 18000 BTU air condition could potentially cope with the heat. Be aware of that. So an RX 6600 XT which draws about 170 Watts instead of the 132 of the RX 6600, will heat up your room uncomfortably if you live in subtropical zones.On full speed the fans of the Asus RX 6600 will be annoyingly loud but for gaming sessions it is manageable. You would not want to hear those fans the whole day long, though.55% of performance satisfaction for the RX 6600 non XT but 100% of built, thermal solution and quality satisfaction of Asus.I use the AMD Adrenaline software. No drivers issues whatsoever. The software hanged up a few times but it works flawless. Yes for 150$ buy by all means this Asus RX 6600 GPU. Passed 200$ look out for something else more powerfull. I never tried to overclock this card nor my MSi GT 1030.Installing this card I had a bit a problem and I would not see how people can install these without having their CPU integrated graphics. You need some sort of display working to get this RX 6600 running. How do you do that without integrated GPU of the CPU? I have the Ryzen 5700G and had to reset several times the BIOS since it did not recognize the RX 6600. At the end only pre installing Adrenaline worked and then  it recognized the RX 6600 suddenly. With the GT 1030 I had no such problems and it worked just plugging it into the PCIE 3.0 port. I use and 600 Watt PSU for this system and that is plenty for this card. This card uses 2 entire slots and covers the 3rd below as well and the one on top is not usable as well. Non of my other PCIE 4 lane plugs are usable since this card covers them all. It is an Mini ATX Asus B450M-A II board. No interference with RAM slots or SATA pluggs. But all else PCIE slots are blocked by the RX 6600. I believe I see there between the aluminum back plate and the PCB at least one single long heat transfer strip (thermal pad) and maybe some smaller ones further to the front - but I am not sure what it is. So the back plate acts as well a bit as an heat sink additionally to the excellent big cooler and heat pipes. The heat pipes are all nickel as it seems and are not copper.Do NOT buy the RX 6600 but rather buy the RX 6600 XT or RX 6650 XT or any more performing. Buy only the Asus or MSi brand - those have the best thermal solutions IMHO.But customer support of Asus and MSi is non existant so if there is an issue with your card you are on your own basically. EVGA does not respond to my warranty claims for the Z15 neighter, so the whole industry tries to get rid of any customer claims lately. CS is non existant on Asus and MSi.', 'Puedo jugar elden ring en altos a 60 fpsLa tengo con un ryzen 5600g', ""Bought this for my daily driver PC as my 4K monitor only supports basic freesync.

Vale la pena comprar.', 'After what feels like 2 years of hawkishly watching GPU prices, they finally dropped to a level I felt were fair-ish, and I obtained this 3060 TI at $525 after crypto took a hit. As a 3D artist and gamer, I\'m very pleased with this GPU. I game on a ultra wide monitor at 3440 x 1440, a bit more demanding then your average 1440 experience. Before I was using a 1660 GTX, so gaming on a ultra wide was only possible after nuking all the graphic settings or playing in 1080p windowed mode.However now with the 3060 TI, I seem to be able to play all the new games on high to ultra settings at around 70-120FPS, with Cyberpunk being the exception requiring medium graphic settings for a still great looking gaming experience. Other older games from 5 years ago like ""Prey"" I get around 120-200+ FPS. For VR games like Pavlov, Alyx, or Boneworks, this card offers flawless performance. For 3D rendering in Adobe Substance or Blender\'s Cycles, this card has cut my render times in half from my 1660, which has greatly improved my workflow.The only complaint I have is this card runs hot, but that seems to be in trend with newer CPUs and other components that seem to be able to take more heat today while still dishing out high performance. I also think I might cry (not really) when the price of a 3070 TI drops to what I bought my 3060 TI for. I wouldn\'t let that stop you from buying this card though, as it\'s still overkill for most of your needs, the 3070 TI would only offer a quarter of a performance boost, nothing that noticeable on the surface.', 'It works very well', 'Easy to install, its a large card so measure your slot.

Coming from a 1660 Super, I\'m getting more than double the FPS and that\'s on a 1440p monitor that I bought at the same time.  With the 1660 Super I was gaming at 1080p.The card runs cool and quiet, I have no complaints.  I upgraded my PSU to a 650-watt just to make sure it gets the power it needs.  The card is not ""crippled"" as another reviewer wrote, it is simply an LHR (Lite Hash Rate) card which means it\'s not for crypto-miners.  It is NOT crippled at all for gaming.  Nvidia created these LHR cards to make more cards available to folks who want to game, not run mining rigs for crypto-currency.  Without these cards, you probably wouldn\'t be able to get one at all.At present, I think the 3060 Ti is the sweet spot where you get the most performance for the money, taking into consideration the current supply-chain problems and chip shortages.', ""The small form factor EVGA RTX 3060 Ti XC is perfect for a small case.

If you want to play the latest games like Cyberpunk at 4k, 144fps, and raytracing on, then yeah of course it'll be loud.  but if you are perfectly fine with a 1080p 144fps gameplay experience like me then it does more then satisfy in terms of noise.I should also mention that, like another review pointed out, I also had one random screw come out of the bag once I took out my card.  it was only one and I assume it's just a standard replacement screw but I can't be for sure and it is slightly concerning.  having said that, I haven't had any issues thus far and it never felt like something was loose while I was handling it.other then that it preformed exactly as expected and my only real complaint is some colors you simply won't get to look nice on the rgb due to the holo that covers it (yellow and pink are the immediate ones that come to mind) but thats a small detail and the rgb can be turned off anyway.Tldr: It's a solid card especially if by some miracle you find it at MSRP.  Don't expect it do anything and everything at 4k with the highest settings (especially with raytracing on) and get more then 60 fps.  do expect it to handle anything and everything well at the very least though."", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0The card looks and performs great. It’s an upgrade from my zotac 2070 super. Was a significant difference in frames and stream performance. So glad I got it for only $600! Definitely would recommend if you’re upgrading from any 2000’ or even 1000’ series cards. The temps stay pretty cool too, it’s great at keeping itself reasonably temped.', 'Upgrading from a 1070Ti and so far, this card is Amazing!  and Perfect for 1440PI Managed to get this card for 730$CAD (There was only 1 left at that time for this price).I ran a few tests so far with undervolt setting to reduce GPU temp and decrease power draw while maintaining performance with high quality setting.  I am sure I can tweak it to get better performance while still keeping the GPU temp in stable condition. Something to keep a note of, GPU temp depends on your environment and airflow build.These are my results.

The stock thermal works perfectly fine. Those GPU temp that I got is amazing. It’s Running all my games with max setting and DLSS technology works flawlessly. And unless you are an audiophile, the fan noise shouldn’t be anything to worry about. I don’t notice it with my headphones on.If you are considering between AMP holo or Trinity OC, in my opinion there’s not much of a difference except for RGB. Extreme AMP holo is overkill and it’s overpriced.', 'The fans are loud i did a undervolt and a fan curve in MSI afterburner to fix that it runs around 65c in my build.', ""Ok I'm used to MSI gpu's frankly they're all I buy but recently I haven't found the Gaming X Trio at a reasonable price point, I stumbled upon this ZOTAC RTX 3070 Ti AMP Holo Black I debated for a while before making the purchase but I'm glad I did it's actually a very beautiful card turned on and even off because of the holographic feature, it's obviously super fast because of the 8G of GDDR6X dedicated vram and the 19Gb/s on the memory Interface, I've been using it since this morning full on benchmarking and playing at Ultra with RT on and DLSS etc etc and it's holding up greatly I replaced this new gpu with my MSI RTX 2070 Super Gaming X Trio and only thing is, is my MSI is super quiet I mean it has the torx fan 3.0 technology  and even at full load you can't even hear it I understand Zotac is obviously a younger company and they've come a long way I know others who own zotac and they have told me to grab one and the seller I had a question and be responded promptly even for me being 3hrs ahead of his time and reassured me that everything was cool and I appreciate that kind of salesmanship THIS COMPANY IS THE REAL DEAL! I recommend them 1000% you will get what you pay for and in perfect shape the box even didn't have not one little nick in it and I look at all that stuff...i will purchase again in the future from High Speed Computing, INC that's all I have for now..some pictures attached.."", ""This GPU was great for the price when everything was insanely expensive and in my opinion looks cosmetically awesome. However, I'd consider another brand if you are in the market for one right now.The fans randomly ramp up to 100% even while not in games. I've tried changing settings on the card but it still happens every few hours. I suspect the hotspot or vram is getting very hot and the fan curve goes from idle or 30% immediately to 100% to bring it under that critical temperature but that is just speculation on my part."", 'It’s a great card, it’s well out preforms my 1070ti it replaced, but I can only recommend it if you can get it around that $600 mark. If you’re going to spend close to $1000 on a GPU you should be considered the 40 series cards or a 3080.', ""I've had this card for about a month or so, and I have been extremely happy with it. I've overclocked it to perform similar to that of a RTX 3080 10GB, and the maximum temperature that it reaches with a undervolt is 65 degrees celsius, which is awesome for the performance you get with this card. In my opinion, the RTX 3070 Ti is the 2nd best bang for your buck card out there, so long as you get it at MSRP, which unfortunately wasnt possible at the time of purchase. This specific model of the card can get a bit noisy, but personally I don't mind noise, and it's not bad, considering the temperatures you can get. The design of the card itself is very sleek, and has some really cool and even customizable RGB. The 8GBs of VRAM can be a bit off-putting, but considering this is mainly a 1440p card, it should be fine for the forseeable future. All in all, I would go with this card over a 3080 and above due to the performance you get for the price, especially after a overclock. Amazing 1440p card that can do ultra settings in pretty much most games at 100+fps.""]"

This allowed for ample airflow and stable GPU temps. It's not a total eyesore either! The base of the bracket has strong magnetic grip, just try not to shift it around after you place it. I accidentally stripped the rubber layer off of one of the feet by doing that. If you're mounting at an angle, you also have to be careful about where you're going to feed the display cable through. I barely managed, but it was all worth it in the end."", 'I have a 4090 and Y60 case. both are beautiful but not a good fit in the case at least in stock form. Technically the Y60 was designed for water cooling. The problem is that the stock mount is too close to the glass so with the size of the 4090, it sits too close to the glass and can’t get proper airflow. I was consistently getting 80-85c temps in modern games with fans on full blast. Wasn’t until I took the glass off to realize what the problem was and ran ~20 degrees cooler. But I don’t like having the glass off my case bc I have a sheddy dog and it gets dusty.I saw this mount recommended on some forums so gave it a try. Solved all my problems! Temps were way down vs stock mount and sits far enough back off the glass. Plus it can sit freely in the case without needing to bolt it in so you can move it around freely in the case and can also tilt it a bit for even better airflow. Super easy to install and sits firm on the bottom of my case with magnets.Only downsides are I think it is overly expensive for what it is. Also the magnets are glued on and just moving it around the case to adjust caused the top layer to start peeling off the feet. It still works fine and stays in place plus you can’t see it so not a big deal but just an annoyance esp for the price.Overall I will say if you have the Y60 case and a bigger card then you need this or a similar mount if you want normal temps. Otherwise I would make sure to take the glass off while gaming. Nice case looks beautiful but it certainly is not perfect.', 'The angle keeps it far enough away from the glass to mitigate air starvation, -1c improvement over normal horizontal mounting. If you have a true 3 slot card, which I don’t (Strix 3080Ti) the bracket will be nicely hidden but in my case sticks out a bit.Make sure you have enough depth in your case to angle it the way you want, I started out at 45 degrees then pulled back to around 30 due to case constraints.Packaging was excellent, far more secure in its own box with thick white foam than I’d expected for a piece of metal with a riser cable.  Riser is of good quality as far as I can tell too! Id been apprehensive for years because of the various stories about cable issues, but so far this holds up and acts completely as it should.Lastly, custom cables are recommended over stock PSU cables due to flexibility concerns. It got TIGHT back there where I routed the cabling, but a few heat up cool down cycles have let them set in nicely.  The magnets that attach it to your case are strong, sliding it slightly into position hasn’t caused any scratches.  Highly recommend this mount', ""Good value - note - the screw on the side of the riser cable with the clip doesn't go in super nicely because on my card it fits in a way that the screw is directly under the clip, making it very difficult to put in. Make sure you have a very small screwdriver!!Works great - brings card away from side panel for better airflow - didn't affect temps on my card, but it is an evga FTW3 Ultra, so the heatsink almost cools it independently, besides the fact I have 10 fans in my system."", 'It was easy to setup, and achieved what it was purchased for. Definitely a must have if you own a Hyte Y60, and a 4090. Temps would hit high 80’s with the stock vertical mount, and now hardly ever go passed 70c. Although I would be cautious about buying if your display port cable heads are thick. To achieve the temps I wanted I had to push my card back far enough that I had to use the gap between gpu and small pcie slots (where the screws that hold in your small PCIE devices) to plug in my monitors.Overall I’m pretty happy with it. I didn’t use the vertical adjustment, but I personally think it’s worth spending the extra to get it just in case you ever are in a situation where you do need the vertical adjustment in the future.(Also that magnet is a freaking anchor, your gpu isn’t going anywhere)', ""If you're like me and you purchased the Hyte Y60 case and Asus ROG Strix 4090oc, this is a must have. Without it, the GPU will not fit correctly."", ""This doesn't mount to a bracket like I thought it would, it just sits at the bottom of your case. So you can't have bottom mounted fans while this is in."", 'The pcie 4.0 riser cable alone costs more than $60 bucks and the fact you can tilt the whole mount makes it so much better, Totally worth it and you get a lot for the price', ""This is a really great mount! Just moving my GPU into this and setting it at a 45 degree angle cooled my card by 10c. Setting it at a 45 degree angle makes it easier for your fans to cool the card. The magnetic feet are a cool feature, it makes it easy to position exactly and then it doesn't move easily. But you need to make sure it will fit in your case. If you have a mid tower case, this probably will have a tough time fitting. I have a full tower and it works great! The included card rise cable seems to be pretty well built, and with these types of mounts, the rise cable is usually the weak link."", 'I needed this for my Hyte Y60 because the included riser cable put GPU flush with the glass and my temps would climb into the 90°C area. With this, I can push my GPU further in the case and the temps are so much better. Now my temps max out around 70-74°C with my 6950XT pulling 345w at 99% usage.']"

I see a lot of reviews where they say this card runs hot, no it doesn\'t. My temps at idle are between 45°C to 55°C and my temps under load range anywhere from 60°C to 75°C, that\'s even better than my EVGA RTX 2080 that I just replaced. When you run a video card that has zero fan movement while idle with short spin ups here and there the temps will seem high at 55°C but their not, that\'s normal, if the fans were spinning then yes those temps would be high. Most people forget to realize that these cards have heat pipes and they keep the card within a decent normal range, I should know, I\'ve been running and building rigs since the birth of the internet and I\'ve seen just about every kind of PC component there is. Plus GPU\'s and VRAMS on a graphics card can handle higher temps than a CPU and northbridge chips.I\'m running this card with an Asus Rog Swift PG48UQ 48"" OLED monitor and let me tell you the graphics in games, videos and photos is just stunning to say the least. I play Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Apex Legends, Elden Ring and Dying light 2 Stay Human which are pretty much your most graphics intensive games right now and the visuals are just out of this world, which in my honest opinion have to be experienced rather than by my words.If I had to throw a con at this card it would be the price, video card prices are still inflated from the chip shortage we had a few years back, when they weren\'t anymore the video card companies took advantage of that and they lowered back to normal pricing but are still quite a bit higher than they used to be. $1500 - $2500 for a video card, you wouldn\'t see those prices three years ago but if your here reading this then I\'m betting that your willing to pay those prices just like I did and let me tell you... you won\'t be disappointed.One other thing I must point out and that\'s when you do a clean install of the NVidia graphics drivers, when their done don\'t just restart or shutdown your computer. You need to shut it down and hit the switch on your PSU to kill any stored power in the video card otherwise the card won\'t operate normally. Mine sounded like a jet engine was taxing the runway and then it dawned on me, you dope, you forgot to power cycle the computer. DOH! After that the quietness was shocking almost, it was almost too quite but that\'s normal for this card. Fans will only spin up if under load.Oh and the Aida64 screenshot of my temps still says EVGA 2080, I haven\'t changed the wording yet but the temp is of this 3090.Well that\'s my review and you can take it or leave it the choice is yours.~Happy gaming!UPDATE 02/11/2023:The fans would speed up to full RPMs and trying to control them with the Zotac software was useless, the only way to get them to normalize was to shutdown the computer and power off the PSU and then power everything back on. I have an OLED monitor and it\'s important to have the screen go to sleep after no activity for a bit to reduce screen retention and when I would bring it back up the fans would slowly start to spin up until they were at full RPMs again. If I installed software it make the fans spin up to full RPMs.This was just not going to do it for me so I contacted Zotac since I registered it the day I received it and it had a extended warranty and they responded and wanted to know my system specs and to see a video of it spinning up. So I gave them my system specs and took a video and after we shared emails back and forth a few times they weren\'t going to honor the return and said I should get with the seller so I did and they responded that they had no replacements. My only other choice was to return it for a full refund and so I did and they\'ve already received it but haven\'t evidently processed it yet. So now I\'m waiting for it to be processed so I can get my money back so I can buy another video card.This has been a nightmare but I guess a blessing in disguise because the replacement that I\'m going to buy will be an RTX 4080 which will seriously outperform this video card. One thing to note though I\'m definitely buying an extended 3-year warranty when I purchase it so as to cover my butt in case something like this happens again. I\'m just lucky that this happened within the first 30 days otherwise I would have been out a video card and my money gone. I noticed that a newer reviewer from me also reported that his fans were also spinning up at full RPMs so if your looking to purchase this video card just be prepared to have to send it back otherwise you could get 4 months, 9 months or a year down the road and this happen to you and the manufacturer won\'t honor the warranty your going to be out the money and a video card. Be careful!~Happy gaming!', 'Download Zotac software and set fan curves.  Temps are fine.', ""Bought the 3090 when the prices dipped when the 40XX series was still peak prices.Unfortunately as all things the 40XX series dropped to near the same prices only a few weeks later!Oh well it's how it is but I have been happy with the card, performs well and I can run any game on highest settings with little to no issue. Only thing is the 'Firestorm' app that controls fan speed doesn't actually allow the fans to run much slower than 25-30%, if you set it lower they will cycle off and on at higher speeds - like they'll kick on from 0% and spike to 100% for a moment then ramp back down to 0% when they are on the thermal threshold to kick the fans off of the 0% floor.The fix is to just set them at a lowest setting of 30% using a custom fan curve. My case is well insulated so I can barely tell the difference over the other case fans. I have not tried and long term stress tests or any overclocking through the included utility - it's fast enough for now for me."", ""I caught this on quite the sale before the 40 series was announced for like 900 bucks. This was part of my first PC build and I wanted a solid card for my first rig. I was not disappointed here. The card has sufficient cooling for even more graphically intense games and it functions very nicely for some of the light video editing I do periodically. The card has a rather hefty metal backplate that helps keep the sagging to a minimum. The included software is OK, it isn't bad, but doesn't give me the warm and fuzzies. And forwhatever reason the GeForce experience software only downloads the latest video editing software and you have to manually update game drivers which is kind of annoying. I actually spent a week trying to figure out why my games kept crashing and that's how I figured out that video editing drivers are not the same as game ready drivers AND that GeForce experience default downloaded the former. I do not regret this purchase and I've been maxing the graphics in settings on pretty much every game I've played in 4k (Warhammer III, Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord, the Metro redux series, and very heavily modded Skyrim)."", 'OVERALLI got my card during the recent early Black Friday sale and got it for $850, for that price this card is great. With the release of the 4080 16gb card I would say get that if you can’t wait, but if you can wait till Black Friday and get a 3090 for $850 or maybe there will be good deals on other 30 series models.PERFORMANCEI have had no issues with the card at all. This card has a subpar default fan curve so I edited mine to keep it well below 80C while gaming. After about a 6 hour day of playing the new MW2 campaign the card maxed at 72C and I got an average of 120 fps on max settings.If you can pick it up for 850 or less it is a decent buy considering the 4080 is 1200$ and only get about 25 ish more fps average.', ""I purchased this somehow right when the new gen came out (4080) and got it for a good price of around 987usd. It performs well, I haven't upgraded the hz on my monitor so I play on a 4k 60hz and it works well. I know I can play at 240hz full HD but haven't budgeted for a new monitor and my 4k still works fine.I use a Ryzen 9 5000 series with it and 32gb vengeance ram. All games run smoothly and it never overheats at 4k 60hz. To put it in perspective I had a 6 hr gaming session once playing with my friends and it didn't go past 72 degrees internal(ryzen 9 5950x max internal is 82 degrees celsius). Other than gaming it runs great and I use this PC for work.Hope this review helps I think this is a great buy even with the new gen out. You really don't need that much more than this for any gaming or streaming experience unless you are some kind of godly creator running an unreal engine or something but even then this will probably do the job if you upgrade to a new Ryzen processor and control your internals better than me."", 'I was very pleased with this card, especially catching it on sale and upgrading from a GTX 2080.

The card itself arrived in an Amazon box with a PowerColor box inside with good packaging to keep the GPU from shifting during transit, and has worked fine in benchmarks and games with more than acceptable frame rates (In fact I have to turn on VSync to stay at 75 fps for my 75 Hz monitor or I get too much tearing. :) ).I only took off one star as while the card was relatively cheap (being ~$1050 at the time of purchase as opposed to other AIBs which charge ~$1200+), it's still far off MSRP for AMD's own models, and I would've preferred to get the card for around $800."", ""I had high hopes for this video card.  This was an upgrade for me coming from an Nvidia RTX 2070.  I had nothing but trouble getting this card to run.  I prepared for the upgrade by uninstalling all Nvidia drivers.

I now start to run some benchmark tests in 3DMark and the pc powers off during the test.  I loaded some older stable AMD drivers, but no luck.  I tried every driver version I could find and always the same result with the pc crashing during any kind of load.I then start to think my power supply can't handle the new card. It is an 850 watt PSU, but took the time to check all cables to verify it was hooked up properly on the 2x 8 pin connectors.

Harder games, such as GTA V run at about 90 fps which is super good.The price was kinda hard - 1000$ is a big price for a graphics card, but considering that it wasn’t available in my country at all, I decided to take it anyway. As long as it doesn’t brake down, I am ok with the price. Not happy about it, but ok.Noise levels are quite low which is impressive. I can only actually hear it when it’s on full power and considering that I haven’t even managed to load it up to its limits - it hasn’t been a problem for me!

Packaging was intact, so it must have been repackaged, but as you can see from the picture, it’s already got black circles from where screws had been, and I had JUST gotten it out of the package. Whatever, it’s okay, I’m not planning on returning it, but I don’t think I should have had to pay the full “New” price for an item that is clearly used.  :/', 'I bought this hoping it would allow me to use a full-height GPU in my 2U rack case, but alas, it does not. It fits nicely between the power supply and CPU Fan, but the brackets are maybe half an inch too high to close the case when installed. Oh well.The adaptor otherwise seemed of high quality, well-packed and well-designed. It’s a bit fiddle to install because it’s actually a set of flat stamped plates held together with screws - not a single C-shaped piece of metal. But if you’re scared off by that then you shouldn’t be tinkering with your PC on this level to begin with.Oh well.

Bear in mind that PCIe risers are notoriously problematic, especially when going for a cheap option like this. Your mileage may vary, but if you need the flexibility of this mount then the included cable will likely be fine.I love the look of this unique layout, and it was only possible with this mount.']"

The mounting holes for my replacement cable did not line up with the mounting bracket so unfortunately I had to mount the cable somewhat crooked, but not too bad.

I originally bought this, because my water cooler hoses wouldn't let the GPU (Gigabyte RTX 2070) fit in a normal orientation. See below.My initial issue is that the product arrived as if someone had opened it, and put it right back in the box after letting it sit on a shelf for a while. The box wasn't sealed with tape (not a big deal), but I was surprised to see that the product didn't come wrapped in plastic like you'd expect from new products. It appeared to have a light layer of dust, and some very light scuffs. The addition hardware that came with it DID come in a bag, but it looks like the back was left in a bin with other hardware for a while as well. For the price, I would have expected it to be a bit cleaner.  Wiry, I tested this bracket in another PC first, and it did work fine, proving full PCIE speed.Now for the issues of fitment: I understand this is probably a universal bracket between the Lian Li product line, but using the supplied support bracket, I could not fit it in. This was because with the support bracket attached, it was too thick, and stuck too far out horizontally fit in between the MB and slot into the rear PCIE IO slots. This is with their LanCool Mesh II case. Of course, not using it works. If you don't use it, be wiry if you use a heavier, longer card for sagging. In addition (this is due to my equipment, and suggestion for Lian Li), I had to rotate my water cooler to get the card to slot into this bracket. The bracket doesn't have screw holes to move the PCIE slot forward, so that dual slot cards can utilize the bottom two slots, moving it further away from the motherboard. Again, beware if you have a larger GPU. I was surprised to realize that they didn't make vertical PCIE slots, or a removal plate to be able to fit this assembly, similar to some of Fractal's cases."", 'Instalacion relativamente facil, eso si si tienes un disipador de CPU grande como el Noctua D15S que tengo yo es enrevesado.

The reviews I've seen say it won't hold a 3080 or 3090 and mainly because those cards are 3 slot cards. The 3060 is only two slots along with the 3070 but the 3070 does extend a little past the second slot with the shroud. All that said I see no reason that any 3000 series cards shouldn't fit but I've been unable to slot a card into it as it seems the PCI slot doesn't line up with where my EVGA 3000 series cards do. It's like the metal mounting bracket on the video card is too thick or something. I plan on seeing if some simple tweaks can get it to fit, I just didn't have the time to look into last night.2022-02-15 Evening Update:Attempted to attach a 2070 Super to it and had the same problem the 3000 series cards did. I unscrewed the PCI board and connected it to the 2070 and carefully placed the card into the position where it would rest and then looking at the PCI board the screw mounts are approx. half a screw width off. Unfortunately, due to how it's made there's no DIY adjustments possible. I opted for a replacement, and we'll see how it goes.2022-02-17 Update:Card fit was a little tight in the bracket but was able to install an EVGA 3080Ti FTW3 Ultra in it. I'm using a Lian Li Mesh II case and had no problems installing the cage in the case. Not sure why they say you can't use a 3080/3090 as mine fits and still has around 3 inches clearance from the side glass that I would have no issue installing a 3 slot 3090 in it."", ""I used this in a Dynamic XL because the bracket for the XL would not allow me to run my custom loop.  My rads have to face port back because of front panel reservoir.

I looked for months if anyone has done this in forums and google and in all the photos I have seen I am the first. After trying multiple Vert GPU brackets this is the ONLY one that worked.  This bracket also accepts the LinkUp Ultra 4.0 Cable.  Recommend the Right Angle 10mm for Dynamic XL as the 15mm still had to be folded.  The ONLY THING that keeps this from being perfect is that there is only 1 mounting slot.  Because of this you can't bring the card forward or run dual cards under water or an audio card in front of a watercooled single slot GPU like you can on the XL Bracket.  Also this does not come with the extra support pin like the XL bracket."", ""I was hoping for a lot more from this bracket.  Unfortunately, it was not sturdy and could not hold my GPU level.  Not only did it look awful, but it actually allowed the GPU weight to 'pull in' the back of the case!There is an attachment to cover up the remaining open slot covers, which fastens to the bracket with two screws.  I couldn't leave the left side screw attached - it was longer than the back of the bracket and interfered with the motherboard (plastic shroud).The riser cable worked just fine.  For anyone using a motherboard with a GEN 4 PCIe slot, you MUST change it to GEN 3 in the BIOS, BEFORE you install the riser cable and attach a GPU.  Otherwise, it will not work.

Per me che uso il pc prevalentemente per lavoro si tramuta in un risparmio di oltre 20 euro l\'anno in bolletta. Gioco 4 ore al giorno (a volte meno, a volte più durante i weekend) e la RX590 sotto un ultra sforzo mi arrivava a 250W mentre questa sotto qualche stress sono riuscito a farla arrivare a 107W. Questo si tramuta in un risparmio per me di 31 euro l\'anno (per 4 ore al giorno ogni giorno). Comprando questa scheda, risparmio in bolletta 60-70 euro l\'anno facendo i conti alla veloce, se invece voi non pagate bollette ma le paga vostro padre o rubate l\'energia questo punto è inutile.2) Gestisce perfettamente il full-hd a 60 FPS per me, che ho 2 schermi (ne uso solo 1 in game ma il secondo comunque pesa).. è l\'ideale per chiunque, se volete più FPS (perchè avete uno schermo a 144Hz) allora non considererete nemmeno la RX590.3) Non considero nemmeno per scherzo le NVIDIA 1650 super e 1660 super (che potrebbero far impensierire questa scheda) perché attualmente costano troppo e non supportano le VULKAN o comunque le nuove tecnologie che invece AMD rilascia su tutti i prodotti. Se i soldi non sono un problema, invece della 1660 super conviene la 5600XT.4) Rispetto alla RX590, scalda tremendamente di meno.. Ho aggiustato la curva delle ventole di entrambe le schede ma comunque, come potete vedere, le faccio viaggiare a metà di quelle della RX590. La scheda è praticamente silenziosissima in game, mentre con uso normale lo erano entrambe visto che le ventole non girano.La RX590 in inverno, in una stanza di 27*C arrivava a 70*C senza problemi (con ventole a max), questa invece da prove veloci che ho fatto (Maggio, stanza 30*C) sta senza troppi problemi sotto i 70*C. Se poi attivate la tecnologia Radeon Chill e limitate gli FPS a 60, allora ho riscontrato che in game non supera i 60*C. Ci tengo a precisare però che il mio case è molto ventilato, ha 5 ventole quindi fate i vostri confronti.5) Attualmente la scheda è venduta con un bundle di giochi del valore di 100 euro circa, possono piacere o meno i giochi venduti ma è da considerare questo fatto e non da tralasciare.. pagata 226 euro, con il bundle viene a costare meno di una RX570/RX580/RX590. Gli youtuber e opinionisti da 4 soldi, invece, dimenticano sempre questo leggerissimo particolare che cambia tutto.L\'ho installata su una PCI 3.0, se avete una scheda madre che supporti il PCI 4.0 credo che non comprerete questa scheda visto che avete il budget.. ma nonostante sia limitata dal bus (vedere video su youtube ) rimane una scelta ottimale SOLO per il full-hd gaming a 60 FPS dettagli massimi.. vabbhé, magari disattivate l\'anti-aliasing e post processing se trovate un gioco che la mette proprio sotto sforzo.Per me, una persona che vuole lavorare tranquillamente e nel tempo libero giocare, è perfetta. Se vi pagate da soli le bollette, è perfetta. Se non avete un monitor ad alto refresh full-hd, è perfetta.Per concludere questa mia difesa a questa scheda (che è un flop secondo certi youtuber e opinionisti da 4 soldi), a dettagli massimi questa scheda garantisce i 60 FPS nei seguenti giochi che ho provato (velocissimamente per curiosità):*  GTA V Online* World War Z (Nonostante il benchmark, in game durante attacchi orda ho riscontrato almeno 90 FPS)* Just Cause 4* World of Tanks* Watch Dogs (dettagli alti ma ho disattivato qualcosa, questo gioco è pesante di natura)Se invece avete uno schermo a 60 FPS ma volete leggere il numeretto che dice che la scheda vi fa 600 FPS, compratevi una RTX 2080 Ti. Se avete cervello e buon senso, questa è un best buy./////////////////////Aggiorno dopo 1 mese:La scheda è fredda/freddissima, non scalda mai. In alcuni giorni ho semplicemente messo il profilo manuale per le ventole ma non ce n\'è tanto bisogno. Supporta tranquillamente tutti i giochi finora provati con grafica alta, dovrò ahimè fare un upgrade sulla CPU per provarla in OC assassino.Durante il lavoro, si ferma al massimo su 11W di consumo ma generalmente sta su 8W.In game, invece, arriva a circa 50W-60W come picco ma in genere si ferma sui 30W come consumi... lool,, aggiungo la prova fatta con borderlands 2 ma anche GTA5 online (grafica alta per avere qualche FPS in più mentre vado con l\'aereo, offline era tutto al max) si mette circa sui 40W. Cercherò di mettere una foto di GTA5 online se non mi sparano nel mentre.In benchmark, invece, a causa del lavoro abissale da fare, si incammina sui 100W.Per 220 euro, la consiglio a chi come me (per motivi di lavoro) gioca nel weekend e si accontenta, per i giocatori più entusiasti invece per 80 euro in più attualmente si può comprare la SAPPHIRE Pulse RADEON RX 5600 XT quindi valutate bene./////////////////////L\'ultimo aggiornamento dei drivers ha praticamente raddoppiato le prestazioni quasi... Ho messo una foto del benchmark di WWZ su ultra (le altre prove che vedere sono su altro) ma resta il fatto documentato che ad oggi questa scheda mangia a colazione ormai una RX590 con OC.Se si limitano gli FPS a massimo 73 (come ho fatto io) il consumo della GPU si attesta sui 40W in game con settaggi ULTRA. Saluti... questa scheda sta diventando valida anche per monitor a 144Hz ormai :D', ""This card is great value, I paid £281 for it and it come with 2 free games Godfall and WoW: Shadowlands, those two games alone at the time of writing this cost £85 combined, so take that off the overall price I paid and the card in theory cost me £196.This card was a last minute unexpected replacement for a blown 980 ti, this card was also purchased by a Nvidia fan boy :P So this review is perfect for anyone who is on the fence about buying one or switching over to AMD.The card runs everything fantastically, installed in the pc without any issues, removed old nvidia drivers before installing the new AMD ones and rebooted since then the cards performance has been great. Comparing it to my 980ti and my old 1060 6gb this card blows them out the water, the last game i was able to play on my 980 ti was Assassins Creed Valhalla and I was getting anything from 57-61 fps in most areas of the game at the high setting, now the same game with the exact same settings on the rx 5600 xt gives me around 91 fps I then set it to very high and get 81-83 fps this card is honestly great. Battlefield 1 average was 182 fps on ultra, Fortnite on my settings Epic Draw Distance, Epic Textures and medium AA, with everthing else on low average 312 fps, The Witcher 3 Ultra 101 fps in Novigrad and even higher out in the wilderness, its just insane how well its performing for the price paid.Some complain about temperatures, it does get warm depending on the game being played but no more so than my 980 ti did that would hit 80'c+ at times and literally warm my room :P This card has hit 74'c on the witcher 3 and the Division 2 thats the Junction Temp too not the actual GPU temp that is usually lower by 20'c approx, so it does run at a nice temp. A few benchmarks for the 1660 ti and 2060 super show temps as high as 77'c for the 1660 ti and ive seen 80'c+ on the 2060, I was under the assumption the 1660 ti/super was a really cool running card but clearly not when under load.As a Nvidia fan boy I was concerned about the AMD issues mentioned in EARLY REVIEWS of these cards, Seems like they fixed all that some time ago Drivers are updated regularly now, I've had no issues with black/green screens or artifacting like some have mentioned in the EARLY REVIEWS, I honestly did take a plunge both feet first into this card not knowing what I was getting myself in to and I'm pleasently surprised in fact I could go as far as saying AMD have now won me over, I had intel CPUs until last year now im running a Ryzen 5 2600x, and now a AMD GPU.If you are thinking of buying a 1660 ti/super plz consider not doing that and buying a 5600xt they cost literally a few pounds more (at the time of this review) and they out perform that massively. If you are thinking about buying a RTX 2060 (like i was) consider a 5600xt instead they out perform the 2060 in a lot of games too ;) they dont need the use DLSS to downscale then upscale again to gain performance they actuall out perform the 2060 using raw horsepower, which also is worth a mention this card uses a few Watts more power than a 1660ti :) so its alot more efficient than the OLD AMD stuff, my 980 ti could use up to 250w of electric which is a joke, this 5600xt has been using 135-140w under heavy load and you can tell too when i played games like fortnite or division 2 on my 980 ti the top exaust fans on my case would throw out really warm air because its eating power like there is no tomorrow, this 5600xt i play the same games put my hand over the top fans and its cool air no waste electric super efficient. The RX 5600xt XFX Thicc-ii Pro 14gps was on the latest bios out the box manufacturer installed so I didnt need to do any bios flashing like some have and its also running on actual 14gbps chips too not like the early cards which had 12gbps chips on some that were then bios updated to overclock to 14gbps these new versions are running a 1750mhz out the box with again the lastest bios installed.Overall though I've had the card a few days its performing fantastically well, it was great value for the money paid and the free games are the cherry on top. Highly recommend you consider a RX 5000 series card for your next GPU maybe this exact one? But after a week of hard research and benchmark video watching, review reading and reddit threads this card was worth it in the end ;) dont let the EARLY reviews put you off AMD have sorted there driver issues out and everything is fine now :)10/10 I would recommend.****EDIT- I'm still using the 5600 xt and I have not had a single issue since day 1. I've thrown a bunch of games at this card now and it's performance has been stellar really impressed. I've played everything from fortnite to control, horizon zero dawn, outriders and many more and it has ran flawlessly. AMDs drivers have been spot on with no complaints from me they have really improved on them and I actually prefer the interface over Nvidia and being able to set custom fan curves and overclocks (never overclocked but the option is there) is a real nice feature. I stream using this card I play games daily using this card it really is a quality card."", 'SUMMARY IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW.I\'m using this GPU as a supplementary GPU while the 3070 is in such high demand, as basically every good NVIDIA GPU is in high demand too. It was either this card, or waiting for a few months. I can\'t actually wait, so this was an urgent call from me.Keep in mind guys that this card is under no circumstance actually WORTH the money. I spent £460 on this thing using money I could afford to lose. This card is actually worth no more than £390 in my opinion.Also, regarding driver issues: there are none. Most people who experience any driver issues are just stupid. You really think a company would give you a working product but faulty software that would render the GPU unusable? OF COURSE NOT. Most people would just rather complain than do a quick google/youtube search for driver fixes. At one point I literally TRIED to get any driver issues to happen. And guess what? I tried everything that supposedly gives BSOD and all that. And still nothing!Make sure you download the right drivers for your PC and card. And make sure you have uninstalled any previous drivers (in case they weren\'t automatically removed). Also, it\'s recommended to restart your PC once again after your drivers finish installing. It\'s those little things that could bring about potential issues.  It\'s obviously not uncommon, but 90% of the time it\'s very clearly just the user\'s ignorance. Make a system restore point, reinstall windows before changing GPUs. Once again, IT\'S THOSE LITTLE THINGS.Unlike video game companies, graphics card companies do not benefit from holding your hand through the entire process like you\'re a little baby or something. They provide the goods, it\'s your responsibility to make sure you get the right goods....I have tested the GPU thoroughly and I am now editing my review:[DISCLAIMER: I HAVE OVERCLOCKED MY GPU TO THE HIGHEST VALUES THAT MY COMPUTER ALLOWS BEFORE CRASHING, THIS OC IS DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT GAMES SO I CAN\'T PROVIDE THE DETAILS WITHOUT A SUPER LENGTHY REVIEW]The GPU is ALMOST worth the price to me now. It can run pretty much any game with almost maximum settings, while also maintaining extremely low temperatures (using an airflow case with almost the best air cooling hardware).Runs minecraft shaders perfectly (not sure what the point of ray tracing is, this is beautiful!), destiny games, dead island definitive edition,EVEN MAX SETTINGS WARZONE RUNS FINE. Had to make some compromises for both 130+ fps, and good graphics, but if you care more about the visuals than framerate, then you could easily run the game at near-max settings and the game would most likely run just fine.Though this sounds obvious, good fans and a good cooler are KEY to playing games with this GPU. Why? Because this boy will get steamy oh how steamy this boy can get. Don\'t keep the fan curves at default settings. Depending on many factors, the default card fan settings may or may not be very good and may cause high temperatures.Currently I do not know about the prices of this GPU on other places on the internet. But, I strongly advise AGAINST buying ANY graphics card, until the stocks become BETTER (it is hell right now).Overall the card is BEAUTIFUL. It\'s very thick, and very pretty. scummy manufacturing practise that taking the sticker off voids warranty, but it does not void basic customer rights. The sticker leaves this ugly text saying ""void"" after you take it off. It\'s pretty annoying, i\'ll try to scrape it off if i feel like it.Hopefully in the future they\'ll add a law to the UK against this ""warranty void if peeled"" thing like they did in America already, as it is mildly annoying. I expect a perfect product when I purchase something so expensive, and yet they had the guts to make it ugly with not only the sticker, but the stuff underneath it.It\'s simply ridiculous. But this is most likely something that ONLY I personally have a big issue with.Anyways, rant over.SUMMARY:Product quality: 9/10.Product performance: 7.5/10 (use userbenchmark for an objective estimate of performance)Product price: 6/10 (paid £460, not worth it obviously)Product software: 9/10.Product weight: surprisingly light. Only got a support bracket because of my OCPD (not OCD). You might want to watch a few videos on GPU sag prevention if you experience any problems (there are quite a few easy preventions that don\'t cost anything).Installation difficulty: Even a 1-month-old toddler could mount it.As advertised? Pretty much yeah.Cooling: 10/10 (Great cooling, but you may need to change the default fan settings)Product practicality: 8/10 (I\'d much rather prefer to have better and bigger fans for example, but these fans cool just fine. This rating also takes into consideration weight, performance, and other ""practical"" things)- Will be modifying, improving and updating the review with time. This is the first version, where I only wrote what came to mind. In the future I will re-structure and improve the review to be shorter and more professional with my next version of this review -', 'Monté pour miner , elle enetait top , maintenant elle n est plus assez rentable mais je joue avec en HD', ""Scalps are grabbing up everything and it's hard to track good deals till I came across this 5700 XT. I am actually quite glad I was pushed to go a different direction then my usual Nvidia route. Radeon has come a long way and this card is perfect for my build. I have just about every game you can think of and this card plays max settings at 1080p, 1440p 60fps+. 4k at 40-45 fps max with a I5 6600k OC 4.2 and just 16GB 1866 DDR3.The only gripe i found out the hard way was this card will not show up till you upgrade to Win10. I was fortunate and had a home edition laying around but i was upset i had to let my Win 8.1 go. There was no driver associated with this card that would go past 17.01 blah blah. So I caved and upgraded to Win 10. Also i need to add the settings and features are so vast associated with this card I am amazed. This also came with Godfall and it plays perfect on 1440p maxed out. I don't care to go pass 60fps and just know this card will run max settings even when you aren't using it 100%.I set it to basically feed it power enough to make my games at least run 60fps and never over so I know this card if you want can exceed that count. Consider purchasing a pilar to help with GPU sag because this card is heavy and it will sag so best invest in one like in my photo that isnt that expensive to make sure your MB is safe and card is safe and level.*Update 11/22/20* Driver IssuesWell it took a few days of purchase for the drivers to become an obstacle. With my particular experience with the audio driver issue via connect HDMI to TV. While scouting online looking for a solution in the end there is none. The issue is and varied but mine was audio cuts off randomly and audio driver would just switch off. Utilizing DDU to clean uninstall and freshly put the newest recommended driver, it worked but then went right back to it. Did all the same troubleshooting as suggested online but nothing. Never had this issue with RTX or GTX if that.*Solution*The only way to break this endless cycle of audio issues was to plug via AUX cable into the MB and directly plug into my sound bar system. This locks and enables use of Realtek driver on the MB. Every since I have had no issue.On another note this card is amazing minus the audio issues. This can play 95% of my library 4k max 60fps+ while I can monitor my utilization is only at 70-85% this was set on purpose because I am using a I5 6600k on a Z170 MB. This card is future proof for awhile.*Noise & Heat*I can't hear the fans and they wont spin until it gets under heavy loads. The system is auto and works perfectly. XFX has come a long way from when I last had their card back in the day and I am glad I got the chance to try them out again.Heat is amazing, the highest I have monitored this was 74c this was under heavy loads. My CPU usually goes up to 47c. The power is not even that high and it will adjust accordingly but I have noticed it take as much as 230w which is nothing. I do need to mention I am not utilizing 100% too and don't need too either."", 'An absolute unit. worth every penny. AMD still providing next gen updates.', 'This particular product is particularly hard to put a star count on, I recommend reading the full review and deciding for yourself if it\'s problems are enough for you to turn away from it. I\'ll separate this review in to three sections: The Good, The Bad, and the Recommendations; If you do plan to buy this Videocard at the very least check out the final section to save yourself a lot of trial and error in set up. Tl;DR: I DO recommend this card but only if you\'re willing to mess with it\'s drivers and tunings to make it work.The Good(Including technical Info):This card has the best price per power on the market full stop, no competition. It outperforms the 2060, it\'s direct competition, and matches or sometimes even surpass the 2070S which runs about a hundred dollars more. You don\'t get in to objectively better performance until the 2080S and at that point you are, at the time of writing, paying $300 more. The card easily runs Final Fantasy XIV, Monster Hunter World Iceborn, and Star Citizen at 1440p. At max settings in all three games I get 90-110 FPS in FFXIV (Full 144 if I turn off SSAO), 60fps in Iceborn with the High Res Textures pack, and about 45-60FPS in Star Citizen. All of these games get the full 144fps of my monitor at 1080p.Temperatures are amazing, but you probably guessed that looking at it\'s three large fans. I run 85 under full load typically and the card is rated to run 95 comfortably. It starts to thermal throttle at about 110. If you give the fans room to breath it runs nice and quiet, however if your fans are too close to anything it\'ll suddenly become a jet engine (A mistake I made initially).The Bad:Woo boy, you\'d think from what I listed in Good i\'d be giving it five stars but here is where we get in to it. First, the drivers are terrible, I spent probably two full days installing drivers, updating them, realizing the updates are unstable, deleting drivers, reinstalling old drivers. Do yourself a favor and run the tool, get recommended drivers NOT optional/optimal drivers, they aren\'t stable. Constant crashing, DirectX Errors, Err12\'s, all of it coming back to the card\'s video drivers or the card itself. The card is also a power hog, you need to have two six pins and a good PSU. Expect to run in to problems on Gold Rated 650W power supplies or even older 850W. These problems are manageable though.What it comes down to: You will have to fight this card. I fought it for two days trying to tame it, i\'ll detail how I finally fixed all it\'s errors below, but be ready to put in work for this money you\'re saving. I still have some minor errors, for example if my PC auto sleeps then the card wont wake up and i\'ll have to hard reset the PC.Lastly, I lost the lottery on this card and ended up getting one with coil whine. This isn\'t uncommon on this card, a very weak buzzing sound that is triggered by certain activities. This can happen with any new GPU and is harmless but annoying, just note that it\'s slightly more common with this GPU than others. They will usually RMA it for you if you get one with coil whine but for many people it just wont be worth the time of sending it in and getting a new one. If your computer is in a case and under your desk, or in my case on the wall, you wont hear it.Recommendations(Or; I tuned this card for an entire weekend so you didn\'t have to):First, as I said above, get only the recommended drivers. Do not get any additional, optional, or ""Optimal"" drivers, they\'re almost never stable with AMD. Second, turn off all of AMD\'s proprietary booster nonsense *especially* Free Synch, as of writing this causes intense flickering and hard crashes. Once the card is stable you can try turning some of these things back on, but do it one by one. Turn off all of Microsoft\'s Game Mode stuff, you should honestly do this anyway but double especially do this when running this card because it doesn\'t play nice with AMD\'s drivers.Finally, and possibly most importantly, if you\'re experiencing a lot of crashes you NEED to undervolt it. This is probably your issue if you\'re running a 650w or an older 850w. This was, at the very least, my biggest issue and it took me two days to figure out.  I recommend maximum Voltage of 1100 and Frequency of 2000. You can find the tuning controls in AMD\'s Adrenaline software. What tends to happen is when the voltage spikes to 1200 if you\'re running a split cable then it overworks the GPU and causes a hard crash in many games.My System Specs(Incase you need the info)Asus Prime x570 MotherboardAMD Ryzen 3900x Processor on an AIO32 Gigs 3800speed memoryXPG 1TB M.2 SSD', 'J\'ai acheté cette carte pour remplacer une R9 Fury X et jouer en 4k60 a mes jeux.Sur ce plan, le paris est tenu, la carte s\'en sort très bien a l\'exception des quelques derniers jeux ou l\'optimisme sur la qualité graphique sera à revoir, tout du moins sur le réglage d\'origine de la carte.On se retrouve donc à la sortie de la boîte avec une carte graphique version ""boostée"" avec une vitesse poussée très très haut par rapport aux performances d\'origine de la carte. C\'est super silencieux. Mais il y a un loup.En effet avec le réglage de base de la carte elle chauffe de trop et ses performances s\'en retrouvent tronquées.La limite de consommation spécifique poussée par le fabriquant ne fait pas de magie.On se retrouve rapidement avec une carte qui dépasse allègrement les 100°CÇa ne fait pas crasher la carte mais la fréquence du GPU étant instable (1500-2000 suivant la charge) la carte ne révèle pas son plein potentiel.Un tour dans le drivers AMD (que beaucoup critiquent, mais en version Adrénaline de avril 2020 c\'est au top) permettent de faire 2 choses importantes1- abaisser la fréquence de la carte a une valeur moins déconnante, et surtout à une tension plus saine2 - régler les ventilateurs si on veut, mais ça fera du bruit.Un bon combo tension fréquence est de 1900MHz/1100mV.A partir de là, les fréquences sont stables et la consommation de la carte chute de plus de 25% pour un impact nul sur les perfs !Oui... La courbe de ventilation d\'origine est bien trop optimiste et le radiateur, bien qu\'immense, ne parvient pas à dissiper efficacement la chaleur.------D\'ici un bon mois, je passerai ma carte en watercooling, un bloc est disponible chez Alphacool pour 109€… avec en option, le rgb et la backplate.Je posterai une mise a jour de mon avis à ce moment là pour confirmer que la carte est excellente MAIS que son refroidisseur ne fait pas bien le boulot.--------Ma recommandation : si vous voulez bricoler un peu et avoir un PCB custom pour bien pousser la carte, celle ci est pour vous.Si vous voulez juste une carte à jeter dans le pc et ne rien toucher, prenez un modèle non-oc qui fera aussi bien le travail pour sans doute moins cher.-- si ce commentaire de produit vous a été utile pour faire votre choix, n\'hésitez pas à me le dire en mettant ""utile"". Sinon si vous avez des questions, postez un commentaire :)', ""I have owned this graphics card, the XFX Rx 5700xt THICC III, since July. I waited this long so that I could really use it before writing a review. I'll admit, back in July (December 2020 now), I was a little hesitant to purchase this card based on some of the reviews complaining about driver instability and crashes. However, I have had no issues in my PC with this. The card has been very stable in my use case. I play a handful of games, some that are taxing to the PC as a whole, others which are not. For reference, I play Call of Duty, Fortnite, Cities Skylines, Microsoft Flight Sim 2020, and Rocket League mostly. Playing these games is a joy with this graphics card. Rocket League is buttery smooth, as is Cities Skylines. Fortnite and Call of Duty you can easily play on max settings, but depending on your monitor you may want to turn some of the settings down to get high refresh rates. I play on a 1080p, 144 Hz monitor. On Call of Duty and Fortnite I get about 125 fps on average, which for me is plenty. I will say, the games runs a little smoother if I put the graphics in game at about one level down from Max, mostly because the fps are then about 150, which matches the refresh rate of the monitor better.Noise levels are great in most situations. I have a case (Lian Li Lancool 2 performance) designed for airflow, as such it will be louder than other cases. This video card runs its three fans at 0 rpm at idle or when doing normal web browsing, video watching, Facebook posting, etc. While playing most games, it rarely gets above 2,000 rpms, which is audible, but not annoying to me. Max speed on the fans is 3,000 rpm. Above 2,000 rpm, it does get loud. Only 1 game that I play (MS FS2020) pushes the card this hard, but even then it is only at certain points during the game. Most of the time the noise levels are perfectly fine to my ears.A couple of negatives: First, this generation of AMD video card does not support Ray Tracing. If this is a big deal to you then this is not the graphics card for you. Second, with the recent release of NVIDEA 3000 series cards and AMD 6000 series cards, you should not buy this card for anywhere near its original MSRP (~$420-$440). The new generation of graphics cards are about the same price, and will outperform this card in all areas. That said, current graphic card supply is crazy low this holiday season.Overall, I would recommend this video card to almost anyone, but that will depend on your budget. For the same price, get a new generation graphics card. If you can find this one on sale and you do not need top of the line performance or ray tracing, go for it!I have this paired with a Ryzen 3700x CPU in case anyone is wondering.""]"

It outperforms it\'s competitors and some of the Nvidia vanilla cards without demanding a new power supply, assuming you have a 400W or above already. Unlike the original 1650 and lower models, this requires a 6-pin PCIe connector, which isn\'t asking much considering it being just a bit above the limit where you wouldn\'t need one, this card does however run hot, was nearing 80C on Ultra playing Dead By Daylight (thanks again to Asus for the free game back in 2016 from my 950 mini purchase), I did not pay attention to the other settings, just switched to Ultra and started playing, it\'s not perfect, however, even on ultra I was still getting noticeably better performance than my now broken Zotac 1050 Ti that was struggling on medium, that shows the huge loop in performance just within the next line of cards and having the OC addition of an already upgraded card. Though, Nvidia made their lineup rather confusing and a bit frustrating for some this time around, especially for those who have already chosen the vanilla 1650 which happens to be the same price at the moment, I appreciate their effort into making a card (from all manufacturers) that despite it\'s inferior specs to some of the competition, can still outperform some of those cards, whether all the time or at some point in a game, depending on the model of course, and without the need to upgrade to more power, sizable form-factors, and even specs, which shows that even that doesn\'t tell the whole deal on performance. The only real downside about this I can say is it seems a little fragile with what looks to be thinner PCB, shroud, and backplate, and it runs very hot, especially boosted. What I do like about the card is Asus\'s effort into thinking about other factors in design like dust-resistance and fan bearings. I\'ve had 3 cards fail because the bearings would wear out within a year or two and start grinding without even many hours into the games, or at least many being the ""typical"" gamer average, I\'m talking failure within about 5 hours of playing a demanding game after just doing minor graphical tasks on every other instance for the span of 1-2 years. After the card nears 80, it does downclock at some point so that it could get back into the mid-70s without a huge performance loss but temperature is certainly its weak point; the heatsink and overall heat dissipation setup is rather small as well, so that doesn\'t help. After having 3 cards fail, longevity has been my main concern; these little cards just seem to give out rather early. I\'m hoping the new bearings, IP5X dust-resistance, and technology behind the card will help its lifespan, and that the heat won\'t become an issue for the card itself, performance, and rest of my components. With a 1850+Mhz clock boost, at its size, it\'s power requirements, and it\'s performance, this thing is a beast in a compact package, not just with what it can do but the thought behind the specs and technology of the card and its components as well. It\'s nice to see a company for once make a positive change, and not release the same exact design for a basic card despite the lineup difference. Hopefully other companies can take note and start using something like ball bearings for their fans and take into account little issues vulnerable components can face and put more thought into their cards, however, with this Asus, temperature is the only real concerning problem that I would say maybe they haven\'t put much thought into as far as that regard, maybe all out performance was their focus, or maybe didn\'t think it would be an issue? Either way, this is a nice card, I chose this version over the Zotac mainly because of the bearings and tech behind it, also it was only $5 more and is factory OC\'d. After 3 bad Zotac experiences, I think my choice was justified.Pros:*Excellent performance for its class and size.*Fairly compact single fan design with minor fitting issues I ran into with the backplate needing to budge/be pulled hard and held toward the screw holes to put the screws in.*Extra thought into the design of some of the most important components*Does look nice imo with the ""ASUS Geforce GTX"" font on the side while viewing inside the case.Cons:*Runs hot with small heat dissipation setup and not much that can be done to resolve the issue*Could have looked a little nicer in terms of aesthetics but with something like this already, that\'s just nitpicking, though I\'m sure it could have been done.*Packaging might have been missing stuff, or ditched GPU Tweak II CD but it might have been done intentionally on this model. Box is rather barebones once you lift the cardboard holding the card, so I feel it could have been downsized to save on materials.Mix:*build quality seems just average, or less than what I\'d like it to be, just a standard card made to do one job, but feels a little fragile with what seems to be thinner parts and some low-quality feeling materials. Hard to tell its durability and strength. The PCB and backplate seem a little thinner than usual or what I\'m used to, and the plastic shroud just feels lightweight/cheap and/or thin of itself, not sure about the actual quality of all the components though. Could just be using not necessarily lower-grade but different materials. Who knows? Could end up being better, at least I hope.UPDATE: 3/23/21. ASUS, please keep using ball-bearing fans and I\'ll buy your cards every single time, since no other company seems to think about fan design and longevity, my last 3-4 cards died between 1 and 3 years from fan-failure because the sleeve bearings would go bad and start grinding from drastic temperature changes after playing some demanding games.', '初めて自分でパソコンを組み立てたのですが、すぐに出来たので良かったです。', ""I've had this card for 3.5 years and it has worked without issue, was easy to install and I love the different settings/graphs it shows without included program. With this and a refurbished multi-core system you can play most games without spending a ton (like $350, much less than a console and it does many other things). Tweak some settings (water reflections, grass swaying, bloom, motion blur etc.), save some money, enjoy games and feel clever."", ""I'm using this card in an Unraid server. It's primary purpose is to provide hardware HEVC encoding.Note that NVIDIA artificially locks these down to something like 4 simultaneous HEVC streams (if memory serves). BUT there is a workaround you can google to unlock unlimited stream encoding.Secondary to that, I wanted a card that could handle some light gaming via a VM. I haven't done this yet as I had some issues getting the IOMMU groupings to work properly."", 'Performance skyrocket than my previous gt 710 a massive upgrade', 'I have this same card in my other computer, runs great, this one was sold to me as used, but it came looking more like an open box one, it was brand new, had all the port covers, and even the cover for the PCIe blade connection.', 'My husband had ordered this card some months ago and went to install it right away replacing the Radeon HD6670 originally in. The computer would give a black screen, it never got to the Windows 10 startup screen, he didn\'t have the booting text that usually appear indicating the harddisks info, statuses and the ""press F2"" or F12 messages.After some reading online in forums at Dell and elsewhere, many people reported that these newer video cards wouldn\'t work in these old desktop Dell models like our(and theirs) XPS8300. But one user reported that he had success with this specific card in a computer as ours. This user reported that for the card to work in Windows 10 and still have the computer boot up and show the text character messages when P.O.S.T.ing (my husband is dictating this to me matter-of-factly ;-) ) Back to this long review: this user said he was enabling the onboard graphics processor. Sheepishly, my hubby tells me that he never knew we had this Integrated Graphics Processor (IGP), he never noticed that behind the plastic plugs in the back of our XPS8300, there were actual connectors, video connectors: one VGA and one HDMI. The successful user also said to go into the BIOS and enable multi-monitor option in order for the motherboard to enable the IGP and the discrete PCIexpress video card. So the order my hubby went about installing successfully this new Asus nVidia GTX1650 SUPER was to 1- Remove the old Radeon 6670 video drivers from within Windows 10.  2- Restart and go into BIOS options to enable multi-monitor, save and exit BIOS, let the computer P.O.S.T. and then press power-off button.  3- Our monitor has an extra VGA input so we got a VGA cable from it to the VGA connector in back of XPS8300.  4- Remove the old discrete video card from PCIexpress slot from motherboard. Leave alone the video cable that was attached to this old card for the moment.  5- Power up the computer, you should see character mode text from P.O.S.T.ing and then the Windows 10 start screen, at the sign on screen, go into your account and let Windows sit awhile so it installs firstly a basic adapter driver and about 5 minutes later, it installs Intel IGP drivers.  6- Power down the computer, install your new ASUS GeForce GTX 1650 Super PCIexpress discrete video card, we installed the video cable that was plugged in our previous Radeon HD6670.  7- Power up the computer, you should see it P.O.S.T.ing and come to the Windows 10 start screen, log in to your account.  8- Let windows install video drivers for your new ASUS GeForce GTX 1650 Super or install them yourself or use Windows Update. VOILÀ all we needed to do was to enable the IGP (Integrated Graphics Processor) and the BIOS multi-monitor option. My husband read for hours online in various forums to find a solution before having to return this card. His effort and steadfast research delivered. I hope this review finds itself helping many UPGRADERS of old hardware like our Dell XPS8300', ""I purchased this to replace the factory installed GT730 on my Lenovo Ideacentre 710-25ISH I bought from Best Buy six or so years ago. I tried streaming Train Simulator 2020 on Twitch and a friend commented that the capture was laggy. I had noticed that my PC would take a hit on frames in high traffic areas, and could only play on medium detail settings at best. I purchased an EVGA 750 G5 Gold-Series modular power supply at the same time as the 1650 to ensure I had more than enough juice for the new GPU before installation. The GPU was larger than I expected but still left plenty of room in the case. I liked the black with white racing stripes design but as I don't have a clear case it will (hopefully) be a long time before I see it again. The GPU plugged right into the PCI slot and snugged right in to the backing plate once it was secured. This GPU did require me to remove a second backing plate in order for it to fit properly, my old 730 only took up the one. This GPU also requires a 4-pin plug connection from the PSU to power it; it will not receive power solely from the PCI slot. I haven't had enough time in Train Simulator to take actual FPS readings, but can tell you the game now runs at its highest detail settings like butter. Zero lag, very smooth, and the added detail is like night and day. This is a great GPU that offers a budget upgrade without hogging up all the space in a tower and demanding a ton of power."", ""I bought this thinking I might be able to stream 1080p 60fps but BEWARE there will be a LOT of stutters, duplicated frames during the stream/recording. I do either 900p or 720p for smooth streaming and gaming. Make sure to run OBS as administrator. If you're looking to play and stream at the same time and you don't have a lot of money to spend, this card is a go.Here are my thoughts. I'm pretty sure you've watched reviews on Youtube but here goes anyways. If you haven't, though, you should.Noise: The fans only ramp up during streaming and gaming where the GPU has to work extra hard, otherwise, barely audible if you have a completely quiet room. If you have either speakers or normal headphones, you won't be able to hear the noise at all.Performance: You really get what you pay for. You can play triple A games at low or medium settings at 1080p 60fps EASILY. This card doesn't even sweat. As long as you don't ask for too much, you'll be satisfied for sure.Thermals: Averages around 70-75 degree Celsius under full load. Peaks at 75 degrees when you play demanding games for hours, it doesn't go above that at all if you don't overclock it. It's already factory overclocked and still has some room for overclocking.Overall, this card is one of the best, if not THE best entry level graphics card, and you add streaming to that value. You can't really go wrong with this card. It won't disappoint you. You might think it's bad because of the bad reputation that the normal 1650 has, but this card is on another level. For $20 more bucks, you get 40% more performance than the normal GTX 1650, the new NVENC encoding with Turing architecture for streaming, and in this card's case, overclocked, quiet and excellent cooling.""]"

When the RTX Titan came out, the 24 GB of VRAM caught my eye and knew it was the card for me.  When i got the card, it took me an hour or so to get it working with it's slower brother, the 1080, but once I started playing around, it did not disappoint.My iray renderings come out much quicker, twice as fast as before.  I'm getting double the framerate on every game i play- the card is so powerful that all games just go to maximum.While it's a little expensive, the card performs very well, it being hooked up to two monitors while my 1080 is connected to four, giving me six total.  The only major draw back on this card, which can be negated by tuning the fan profile, is the heat. I had to use third party software to crank the fans up to near maximum when the card is under full load.Other than that, i've maxed the card out once with a single iray scene. Other than that, it's a solid buy.EDIT/UPDATE: So I've been using this card for almost a year; games, CAD, Daz Renderings. It's a solid card at 24 GB of RAM and i've managed to max it out several times on RAM.  it's a champ to say the least. I managed to render 5 different 300 DPI 6 x 9  images in 5 hours - simultaneously.I definitely plan on getting a second card when the wallet allows.  Please note the card's speed drops 200 mhz when it breaches 84 Celsius. a custom curve in MSI afterburner keeps it at 84 c or just under.If you purchase this card- there will be a delay for funds verification. so that 2 day becomes 3 or 4. Signature required.  As for gaming- it utilizes about 1/5 of it's total processing power to deliver (I cap at 60 fps)."", 'I hope to purchase a second soon, if I need it.  I am using this card on both Windows 10 and Intel Clear Linux OS, and using the proprietary NVIDIA drivers on both.  Intention is to code both for machine learning and RTX.  I have tested it lightly on some games, and it appears to be an impressive improvement over my older model 1080 Ti.  I did not buy the Titan RTX primarily for gaming.  My rating for value for money is not scientific, but a seat-of-the-pants feeling, for how it cmpares to my 1080 TI experience.  This is an expensive card with lots of memory that is useful for neural networks and compute shader algorithms, but it is an entry-level platform in this respect.  You can double this with two Titan RTX, for 48 GB, but before you think that is a lot, look at the NVIDIA site for full-on solutions that cost much more.  One thing to consider is that the twin blower fans pull air from one side, and exhaust top and bottom through a heat sink running the length of the card--these do not exhaust out of the backplane like a commodity gaming rig does, they exhaust internally on most cases.  This means that you need to consider your chassis cooling design differently, especially if you plan to use two cards.  I like the design, it is actually more flexible. Use an appropriate chassis, maybe not your old GForce GTX chassis.  My ambient room temperature is 75 F degrees, and I have six fans exhausting from a 6U case with lots of room around my single card, which is on a Thermaltake 16x riser.  The card is cool to the touch while writing this review, and warm for the 3D I have tried so far.  Hope this helps someone, ok, now I must get back to work!', ""For gaming, this is a near-total waste of money; just get 2080Ti instead. No game manufacturer is going to waste time targeting this card's resources.This card is for deep learning and maybe other sci/tech applications. It's not even good value for mining crypto. Almost the only reason to get this card is to fit a large model (probably a neural net) into its spacious 24GB of vram, and for that purpose it works fine.Don't think of it as an RTX card. Don't think of it as a Titan card. Think of it as a Quadro 6000 with the 64-bit flops disabled. Because that's what it is."", 'Hands down a powerful beast for a consumer card. Handles pretty much anything thrown at in like a champ. The 24GB VRAM helps a lot for rendering and high use applications (of which I almost exceeded at one point). There is some coil whine when under heavy stress, but I noticed it actually got quieter the more I used it. Fans are decently quiet and you can keep it under 84C it in most applications.

It is a bit disappointing to not be able to stack them together in one system due to cooling issues, but I'm happy none the less.Please don't buy for gaming.

Por otro lado, es posible ponerle un ventilador adicional estándar (fácilmente reemplazable) si el espacio dentro de gabinete lo permite.-- Las temperaturas de GT710 en carga de gráficos baja oscilan entre 38-45°C, en carga media – no exceden 65°C.-- Bajo consumo energético (solo 19W) tomado directamente de ranura PCIe, la hace compatible con cualquier Fuente de Poder básica. El fabricante por seguridad le recomienda Fuente de 300W, pero realmente le sobra una con menos potencia dependiendo del consumo de CPU.-- Su interfaz PCIe tiene x8 lanes de transferencia de datos versión 2.0 (500 MB/s x 8 = 4GB/s el ancho de banda total PCIe).-- Es compatible con Tarjetas Madre PCIe 3.0, solo que aquí la velocidad máxima de transferencia de datos se quedará limitada por interfaz 2.0 de GT710.-- Soporta UEFI nativo, es totalmente compatible con instalación de W10 y CSM (Legacy) deshabilitado, con particiones de disco en GPT.-- Soporta DirectX 12.-- Su rendimiento según gpu.userbenchmark, supera por 2x a los gráficos integrados Intel de segunda y tercera generaciones (Sandy e Ivy Bridges) y también supera o equivale a algunos de cuarta generación (Haswell), por eso es recomendable para actualizar los equipos que utilizan tales CPU o inferiores.En CONTRA:-- Aunque su memoria dedicada es tipo GDDR5, el Bus interno de memoria es de solo 64 Bit.-- La cantidad de memoria dedicada (2GB) me pareció excesiva tomando en cuenta el óptimo rendimiento que puede ofrecer GT710. Los juegos retro que es capaz de procesar bien la tarjeta solo utilizan hasta 1GB. Y por ejemplo para Edición de Videos, este producto a priori es poco apropiado.-- Demasiado básica para Gaming actual. Con un juego del año 2010 – Left4Dead2, los ajustes de video recomendados solo ascienden a resolución 1600x900. Teóricamente es posible hacer Overclocking de tarjeta y subir ajustes del juego, pero así temperaturas subirán excesivamente.-- No soporta resolución 4K completa.-- Es incompatible con W10 inferior a versiones 18xx (en mi caso W10 LTSB 1607). El driver NVIDIA daba mensaje de incompatibilidad, no dejaba realizar instalación y remitía a la web de fabricante recomendando driver “Estándar”, cual no existe en ningún lado. El actualizador de W10 a su vez intentaba instalar driver desde repositorio pero también fallaba. Por eso he probado GT710 con W10 Pro 20H1 y Pro 21H1 – pero con ambos mi CPU perdía en rendimiento (!) 7 puntos (18%) en cpu.userbenchmark. Finalmente todo se solucionó con instalación de W10 LTSC 1809 que resultó ser compatible con driver de GT710, además de optimizar adecuadamente el rendimiento de CPU.-- El software incluido con la tarjeta – Asus GPU Tweak II, configurado por defecto reduce el rendimiento de CPU bajando sus puntos en el benchmark. Opté por no usarlo.-- Comparando con Gráficos Integrados, esta tarjeta siendo DEDICADA consume energía adicional y es fuente de calor añadido dentro del gabinete. El mercado actualmente ofrece Gráficos Integrados mucho más avanzados que GT710 - que convierte a GT710 en obsoleta si estás armando una PC nueva, y solo le da sentido en actualizaciones de computadoras-retro.CONCLUSIÓN:Debido a que necesitaba 2x salidas de video Digitales para conexión de 2x monitores 1080p, este producto de ASUS resultó ser útil para tal fin gestionando a perfección las pantallas conectadas por DVI y HDMI. Pero en mi caso personal no se ha conseguido la mejora sustancial de rendimiento ya que los gráficos que tiene integrado mi CPU – casi equivalen a GT710.

I didn’t realize the card took up 2.5 slots so it covered over my other x16 PCIe slot I use for my NVME raid card.So I purchased the 1000mm variant of This PCIe Extender and I’m very pleased with it! I have gotten back function of the other x16 PCIe slot that was previously covered up. I probably could have gotten by with the 600mm but I wanted to be safe and have a little extra cable length. There’s no noticeable performance drop while gaming either. I also realize that an 11 year old Mac Pro is not ideal for gaming but it still keeps up and plays most everything I care to play at 4k60.Anyways I definitely recommend this solution for anyone who has a graphics card that doesn’t quite fit.', 'Bought-installed October 13, 2021. My pc remained unmoved and unaltered since then and this cable caused numerous PC issues (outlined below) about a month or so ago. My setup is an Nvidia 1080TI with 4 connected monitors. 3 DP and 1 HDMI using this cable to have a verticle-mounted GPU.Initial issues.-The OLED display on my Thor1200 Power Supply stopped working but the supply continued to power and allow my computer to work otherwise.-Next, my internal cooling fans would cont. to spin with my computer turned off.  Note - I removed all but my monitor cables including the main power cord and they still spun. Removing my DP cables stopped the fans from staying on. The fans staying on was periodic and would not do it every day.-I then had my left monitor no longer get detected using a DP connection.I replaced all my monitor cables and still no luck. I removed my video card and reconnected this cable firmly at both ends with no changes. I then removed the cable and mounted my 1080TI to the motherboard directly horizontally and everything works 100% as it should.And for those wondering, the cable was a nice length, had no kinks, and had secure connections at both ends with no tension at the ends in my setup.The cable feels sturdy and well made, the price was decent when purchased but only one star due to how much I had to go through to find out the cable went bad in such a short amount of time.', 'This was the only riser cable I could find in stock at 60cm. I had no idea how expensive the long cables could be at about 80 bucks. I almost wish this were more flexible. In a perfect world, it would fold like paper but im scared to do that so I just have a rotated cable mess.The only real bad side of this is that the end that plugs into the GPU is about 1 1/2 inches long which im not sure if it can be shortened. This was almost too big to fit in the custom case im making', 'I saw a 40-50% increase in frames in almost all my games after installing this cable. It is a huge improvement over the crap one that came with the Core P3 Case. Overwatch ran at 45-85 fps in the old cable and 145-175 on the new cable. The build quality is phenomenal, the best available in my opinion. The black strands running cable consist of a quality rubber and can be bent and twisted as needed without you worrying about it. I needed to move the GPU slightly further away form the chassis as I originally had it configured (you can see my finger is pointing towards the old screw location). This was because the cable is slightly hard to bend towards the top and bottom and keeping the GPU in its original location would uncomfortably push on the cable where it connects to the mobo. But no worries, simply moving the GPU forwards solved the pushing issue. Thermaltake thought through the cable design and included a nice ThermalTake logo in locations where the cable is visible in their ""P"" model cases. Very well done and highly highly recommended if you are seeing lag when using the crap cable included in their Core P3 case. The 300mm cable is a boss.', ""_Well, so far this Premium cable is working and not causing any issues.The build quality is quite nice, particularly where the cable meets the PCB boards. The EZDIY cable has two separate pieces there which flex easily and make a rather worrying noise._Price is a little on the high side, but @ $61 at time of purchase, it is quite a bit cheaper than the Lian Li & 3M cables. Perhaps those are better, I can't say. Maybe a touch longer than I'd like for the Core P3 case. Works fine, but it has to be folded a little tighter than I'd personally prefer. They do advertise that it can be bent over... though I wouldn't trust doing that. If you're able to mount the PSU with the fan facing out in your setup, you shouldn't have to bend it like I do._Note that the reviews for this premium cable & the other cable are being combined._Installed the Premium 300mm version in my system on 8/3/17.Will be sure to update this if I have issues later, I know many fellow Thermaltake Core owners in particular are having trouble."", 'It looks good but I was unable to use it with mid tower because it makes contact with psu shroud. It does look nice/clean saving it for a later build', 'Sigh.Lets get something out of the way. Compared to similar products out there (Incl. Thermaltake\'s own products) - this is a 5* product and the ONLY one I have tried that actually works. Build quality is FAR better on these - 10x better in fact. Looks great too, esp. the logo and split ribbon cable.I have tried 2x Thermaltake\'s original cable, and 2/2 failed ( New versions in the ""flat"" packaging). One was not running at fill speed and causing artifacts, the other the HDMI out sound was stuttering and unusable. Surprise, surprise everything works 100% when not using the riser cables. I was SO careful not to bend them or create any sharp angles, but in the end I ate my words after telling others they worked well.Soooo I am now forced to pay $90 for a glorified ribbon cable being put in a $110 dollar case. The original cables (which of course did NOT come with the case) were around 40 and I felt like I was getting screwed. After going through 2 of them (which are STILL sold on Amazon.ca despite having like a 90% failure rate) and spending $80 and ending up with $80 of junk cables, I decided I\'d try this once they hit Canada. * KUDOS to Amazon\'s customer service - I was able to return the defective products to Amazon and take that $$ and buy this product. (Should have been this way from the start, and not months of troubleshooting bad cables)So Long story short, Cable works 100%, HDMI audio is good, full speed and games run exactly as it was without the riser card. It\'s a shame I had to spend my own money to become a Thermaktake guinea pig, at the cost of my own dollar. You would think a company like this would live and die based on customer satisfaction, but that is clearly not the case, as there are HUNDREDS of reports of people buying garbage PCiE riser cables, and Thermaltake replacing them time and time again, I elected not to contact them through their forums and wait weeks and weeks to play ""musical risers""ANYONE LOOKING FOR PCIE x16 RISER CABLES - THESE ARE THE ONES TO BUY, DON\'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON ANYTHING ELSE!!  (3M\'s risers are good I hear, but expensive and look like crap - These look great and cost probably less after shipping)So I recommend these with a grain of salt - I don\'t really want to recommend ANYTHING from ThermalTake after the gong-show I went thru...I wish I would have known before I spend hundreds on Thermaltake cases\\fans, etc.ThermalTake View 27 (V27) Case if anyone wanted to know (Not one of those Core\'s...)', ""Great company , I Bought this to try to display my graphics card and all the LED on it.. However the stand i bought to use this with didn't fit and i had to return the product. I will say this , i did a lot of research into these PCI cables and this one had the best reviews by far out of all the brands.. I wanted a cable that would lose its speed or cause overheating and this is the one if your having to go distances. Linus Tech even has a video attaching several feet and not loosing speed on data. Any who they let me return the product and was fast on the return.. I will always keep them in mind for future business and i feel safe with them."", ""This cable is the best one for anyone wanting to mount their GPU horizontally.  The other ones that are 200mm are *barely* able to reach from the socket to the GPU and when it does, it's bending the cable at an angle that could hinder the connection.  The 300mm is just long enough to give soft curves in the cable and not hard bends.  Also, it has been going around the internet that riser cables diminish the FPS from the GPU.  For this particular cable, that is NOT TRUE.  I've tested it with several games and I'm getting the same FPS that I did before mounting the GPU horizontally.  I don't know about the other cables, but on this one, it is not an issue.  The cable is good quality and exercising a little patience when mounting gives very little bending or creasing."", ""Review for 300mm+ Premium riser cable:This cable is fantastic. Swapping cables solved all issues I was having with my PC, including issues that seemed unrelated to my GPU. First off - I was unable to overclock my RAM. Anything over 2533MHz was failing. Games would intermittently cut out or freeze or experience massive frame drops. After buying this cable when a Reddit user suggested it (claimed I may be having issues overclocking due to voltage loss in my 200mm riser), I'm OC my ram, processor, and GPU at the same time. This is power you experience while having a direct connection to the motherboard.Review for 200mm (included with ThermalTake Core P3 and P5 cases) - This sucks and will cause a headache. DO NOT BUY. Horribly shielded and too short to really use anyway. If you bought a Thermaltake case including one of these 200mm risers, I recommend replacing it with a properly shielded 300mm or longer premium cable.""]"

The design engineers I don\'t think had any vision a video card could get so big, until you see it in person, these cards are huge.  I had to decide with the size and case, return the card because I could not make it fit, get a new case after I spent 150 or so on this case just a few months ago or see if I could modify the metal bracket areas where the card would navigate in.  Looking at my options I chose to go into the case, using metal tin snips (scissors that cut metal) and cut about 5"" of metal on the back area and then the center support frame.  Yes it looks ugly where I made the gaps to allow the case to be installed but when the case is closed up with the panel you would never know through the viewing window.I have an evga 850w power supply, ran the 3 evga channel connectors to each pigtail for the new connection.

I doubt I could reasonably install anything in my other PCIe slots.I wanted to wait for better pricing, but unfortunately my 2080 died prematurely. The 4080 is definitely a nice card, but the price is absolutely not good. You should grab this card if you can get it at 800-900 USD.', 'I finally pulled the trigger on the 40 Series. I kept putting it off because GPU prices seemed out of control, but I started running into situations where my 3080 Ti was dipping below 60fps at 4K/Ultra settings in certain games, which is just a personal standard I use to convince myself I need an upgrade lol.I was expecting a 30-40% performance boost. What I got was closer to a 50% performance boost while being waaay more power-efficient and damn near silent compared to my 3080 Ti.I’m not exaggerating…they used the same cooler from their 4090 model on this 4080, which has a much lower TDP than the 4090, so it runs like theres a serial killer in the house and its hiding under the bed trying not to make a sound. I even set a more aggressive fan profile to make the fans ramp up and I could still barely hear it. After an hour of gaming at 4K I checked my temps and saw the highest the card hit during that time was 56C.Pair all that with DLSS 3 and its AI Frame Generation and you’re getting one really impressive GPU. It’s expensive, but its also incredible.', ""No coil whine. Runs cool in an air cooled tower. Sometimes the fans don't even turn. Decent lighting effects, especially with the fans. Running Diablo 4 at max settings, getting max frames on a1440p 144 hz monitor. Tried D4 on a 4k, 60 hz monitor, frames were maxed out, but the slight improvement in resolution didn't justify the lower frames, so I'm sticking with 1440p.

You'll get a lot more performance for your buck.The GPU is amazingly silent, and its temperatures are great."", 'Ive been using it for almost a month. Even though price/performance is not the best if we take away the price component its a great card. Runs cool 50C on ultra graphics 1440p. It also has 4 year warranty so thats very good.', 'The size difference between a traditional GPU and the 4080 is staggering.  Pictured is my old RTX 2070 Super and my new RTX 4080.Installing the Anti-Sag Bracket proved problematic and is probably unnecessary with the nice metal backplate Gigabyte provides.Performance is good, I max out my FPS (my 1440p monitor goes up to 175hz so I get 175 FPS) playing Diablo 4 on Ultra in 1440p.  Specifically the dungeons are maxed out FPS, I see a dip in town (90 FPS), not sure why.', 'I am extremely happy with this Gigabyte Gaming OC RTX 4080. It has the exact same cooler that’s on the Gaming OC 4090 so the temps are incredible. While playing any game at 1440p with highest settings, the fans barely ever turn on. When they do turn on, they never ramp up, and they only stay on for about a minute since the cooler is so over engineered. I am glad they did it like this. I have yet to see the temps go above 55° and haven’t seen the hotspot go above 64°Like I said, it’s huge, in the pictures I posted, you can see how big it looks next to my RTX 3080 Ti, and how big it looks compared to the 24” monitor behind it. The 4080 is a bit taller.I’ve had lots of different GPU’s and this is my favorite by far. And not just because of the performance, but because of the design, and the ability to control the Gigabyte logo RGB color and the fan RGB color separately. Also because the support bracket that came with it is extremely solid. I checked with a level to see how well it held it up and it was perfectly level. No sag at all. I saw reviews that said the bracket didn’t fit their case or motherboard, but the bracket fit my Gigabyte X670 motherboard just fine.If you told me I had to think of one thing I didn’t like about this card, I’d say it kind of sucks that the RGB under the fans doesn’t turn on unless the fans are spinning. That isn’t really an issue though because you can set a custom fan curve so that the fans are always or almost always spinning even a little.So if you’re looking for a 4080, I absolutely recommend this Gigabyte Gaming OC 4080. I like it so much, I will definitely be getting another gigabyte for the Nvidia 50 series GPU’s.', ""I'm very pleased with the card.  Upgraded from a 3080 to this for faster 4K gaming.  It's super quiet and I love Gigabyte's anti-sag bracket system.  Too much money imo but still a great card for this generation.""]"

The peladn.com website suggested that I install the amdgpu-install program and run it, but that did not seem to work, apparently because the Fedora repositories do not have some of the code that the script wants to use.  So I went online and learned that Fedora does not always support AMD GPU\'s, and that the amdgpu-install program is not written to be run in Fedora.  But then after reading more online postings I tried removing the amdgpu-install program, and relying instead on the AMD GPU capabilities that are apparently already in the Linux kernel.  That seemed to work.So in the end I was successful at putting this into a Razer Core X eGPU case, connecting it to the thunderbolt 3 port of a NUC computer, and using it with Fedora 38 without installing any extra programs or drivers.

Quality is good, the RGB lighting is solid, and of course, the performance is good for what it’s supposed to be good at. 4060ti is no 1440p monster, but it doesn’t have to be, it runs 1080p smoothly on the vast majority of titles.Before buying this card, I watched hordes of YouTubers diss NVIDIA, especially their newest lineup of the 4060 and 4060ti, but it was like they were completely ignoring what makes this card special. NVIDIA is a trash company, absolutely. They overcharge, absolutely. But for the last year I had a 6700xt in my system, cheaper card but it offered similar performance… when it worked. The drivers were absolutely awful. I don’t think I got to play a single game on it without it crashing. And out of denial, I purchased new RAM, new coolers, new power supplies even. I didn’t want to repurchase the GPU, of all things. But it ended up being that the 6700xt WAS the problem. I want something new generation that I will feel comfortable running for the foreseeable future, but I’m not willing to spend $500+. And so, for someone who plays on a 1080p monitor, I got the 4060ti, which while it could be cheaper, it’s cheap enough, because at the end of the day, all I want is a working graphics card and ultimately a working computer.

I am gaming on 1440p Ultrawide and using DLSS quality with mixed high settings I am getting 120-140 fps in MW2 multiplayer. The gpu uses very little power as well which is a huge plus for sff or if electricity is expensive where you live. The only downside is the fans are a little loud but not bad, it can be tuned if it bothers you. I used the 1 click OC and got a few more fps for free.If looking for low power and a white GPU this fits the bill. Do we all wish it was cheaper.... Of course, but in the current market it is solid for a new current gen GPU.

The coil hum could very well be my PSU’s fault (It’s a Corsair RM750e 2023), or my power outlet, but the sound doesn’t bother me as long as I wear headphones.

Suffice it to say, this card exists in kind of a strange niche, in part because it's not much of an upgrade over the 3070 TI, is relatively expensive compared to the performance, and only has 8GB of RAM at a time that most cards in this class—especially on team red—have 12GB.If you're looking at this card, though, you are probably aware of all of this.What I am going to review is my experience with Galax.  The first card I received seemed to only have one working fan.  I read that this can be normal, as some cards will only spin up fans when under load.  So, I ran FurMark for an hour and the second fan never spun up.  I then installed the PC software from Galax and manually set the fans to 100%.  No joy.  I also tried the app, but still no luck.So, I visited Galax's website—which was always super slow—and eventually found their support page.  There is no forum or support form, just an email address.  I sent them an email describing my problem and waited for a response... and waited.  In fact, over two weeks later, I'm still waiting.Fortunately, Amazon support is second to none and shipped out a replacement in short order.  Most importantly, it had two functional fans.So,, my suggestion would be to go with a different brand that provides a modicum of support for their products."", ""This one gets very tricky to review: There is a lot more to graphic cards than simply sticking a star rating on it as I usually like to factor pricing and performance in, but graphic card pricing, competition, versions, design decisions and the like are all over the place right now, and I believe it will take more research than what a simple review can provide to determine if this is a good consideration for you.So for a rare one of my reviews, I'll simply have to limit to my experience and how it worked for me.I've had an old faithful gaming system for a number of years with one of the most-used (still) video cards judging from the metrics from a popular game providing site that tracks such things: The reliable GeForce 1060. This has managed to keep my system running for a number of years, but it was finally getting older and unable to keep up with newer things. Enter the chance to review this card, the updated GTX 4060 TI. Checking the power requirements jumped from 120W for the 1060 to this 4060 TI rated at maxing out at 160W (these are baseline estimates, not from Galax itself), I figured it was a pretty safe substitution.I benchmarked the 1060 first, (using Time Spy, resulting in a score of 4,280), then pulled it from the system. A little playing with freeing up some power cords (I needed to go from a 6 pin to 8 pin connector), I got everything hooked up and booted with no issues beyond needing a couple of reboots before everything seemed happy. Running Time Spy again, there was a dramatic jump all the way to 10,846, a 253% improvement in the benchmark score.From there, it's definitely been a big jump in improvement for my system and has been stable so far.Once again, not getting into the design factors, RAM, cost, etc., which should all be considered outside of a review, I found this to be simple to install, worked as expected, and provided a dramatic boost to my systems GPU capabilities over an older 1060."", ""This Galax 4060Ti is replacing my 2070 Super that I have been using since May 2020. To be blunt, I was not expecting much from this card as the video reviews didn't have much positive to say about the 4060TI product line relative to its position in the RTX 4000-series line up with some saying it never should have existed in the first place. I wasn't even particularly excited when I saw it available in my queue.I will admit right now: I was so wrong!Digging in a little, what drew my attention the most was the fact that this 4060 Ti required a smaller power supply than my 2070 Super. That's a nice perk given how power-hungry modern GPUs can be. I installed the most recent driver (536.37) and I ran Unigine's Superposition benchmark at 1080p Extreme. This Galax 4060Ti returned a whopping +163% higher score relative to the 2070 Super.  I couldn't believe the difference and thought it was a mistake so I loaded Cyberpunk 2077 and started running more benchmarks.Testing rasterization using the Ultra quality setting at 2K resolution, the 4060Ti managed an average FPS of 65 which is slightly more than double of the 32FPS that the 2070S was capable of delivering. Moving to test ray tracing, using the Overdrive quality setting, the 2070S was crushed to an average 16 FPS while the 4060Ti managed a respectable 29 FPS.Galax provides tuning software that made overclocking this card very simple. The tool found another 165MHz of GPU clockspeed and all it took was letting the app adjust and test over the course of about 35 minutes. This is so much better and easier than making an adjustment then running stress-test software iteratively.To say I was surprised after running these tests would be an understatement. I game on a 2K-resolution monitor and will happily run this 4060Ti as a substantial upgrade over my 2070 Super. I appreciate the new technology like DLSS 3.0 that this GPU adds to my computer and despite the criticisms, find the performance to be solid. I think at MSRP, this GPU would be a good option for a beginning gamer or a casual gamer who doesn't need every detail or every frame but would like to be enjoy the middle ground of both.As for value, I paid $530 in 2020 for my 2070 Super. Adjusted for inflation, that's a little over $630 today. As of the writing of this review, the MSRP of this GPU is $429. So I'm getting about double the performance with less power consumption and the real cost is actually lower. All things considered, I'm very pleased with this Galax 4060Ti!"", 'I picked this up because I was building my brother a Gaming PC and this is the most essential component of that. I wanted to get him something nice, but not too much since this would be his first PC. I stumbled across this 4060 Ti and decided to give it a test! From the product pictures, it doesn’t look like much, but once you get it in person you can really see the fine details. There seems to be a lot more thought put into the quality and design of the GPU shroud than I had initially thought, but everything on this is very high quality. The fans do look a little thin, but should be more than sufficient for this kind of GPU.As far as performance, with DLSS 3.0 on its side, this thing is a little monster! You can run most games on high settings and get more than 60 FPS easily! If you tune it correctly, you could probably double that framerate, and it does depend from game to game. Competitive games will be easily played with this card and you can get substantially high frame rates depending on how you set them up. Games like RDR2 and Cyberpunk on the other hand are a little more demanding, but thankfully that’s where DLSS can help us out. This would be more of an entry level card in terms of RayTracing performance, but you could still enjoy some games with it turned on.Overall, at a low price point, this GPU is a great choice for entry level builders looking for a high quality graphics card! I definitely suggest giving it a try :)']"

E.x. NOT the same as a say Sapphire Nitro RX 590 which has the 12nm Polaris 30 XXX core. This card has a 14nm Polaris 20 XTR die, which is basically the highest end of the Polaris 20/RX 580 cores. It was originally intended for Asia Only launch as “RX 590 GME” which it does identify itself as in vBIOS/GPU-Z. It’s not false advertising to be clear, but its also not the same as most RX 590s which likely outperform this by a few percent from the finer process node alone. That said. I took it apart and it does appear like a new PCB and the die substrate is NOT discolored so I couldnt find evidence this particular company is reusing old mining GPUs like some tech reviewers mentioned about Polaris chips, if it was, it doesnt show any signs of instability or overuse.OVERCLOCKING: without modding the BIOS (which you can do to go further) this card OCs much better than I was expecting given the cheap cooler (only downside IMO but at least it has a few heatpipes). I’ve gotten 2000Mhz VRAM clock, +11% Core (~1490Mhz) and +50% Power Limit (maxxing out at ~235 watts, 60w higher than rated TDP). Again just quick OCing with Timespy and Heaven, can go higher with BIOS modding/rigging a more powerful cooling solution.Overall impressed for the price considering Amazon’s still selling GTX 1650s at over $200 and RX 550s at the same price. If you need a good GPU for 1080p/720p gaming (or 1440p with less graphically intensive games) or just general compute tasks on a budget, This is probably the best option at this time. Just note the power delivery requirements. 6pin PCIE + x16 slot, minimally 175w without mod/OC or 230-250w with tuning.', ""I bought 2 cards. Both of them looked (and smelled) brand new. As a positive surprise(for me at least), the card does have a 145 W TDP(with a boost clock of 1340 MHz only), but also it has just a 6 pin PCI-e power connector. The disadvantage of the card is the cooling system. The fans become noisy when the card is fully loaded, but the cooling is sufficient to keep the card at max. 80  degree Celsius . I don't know if the original RX570/RX580/RX590 coolers does have the same noise problem (as they have different radiator with more heat pipes). I use the 2 cards in crossfire setup(for GPU computing). I did a quick test as well and their power equals to a Radeon RX6600(non-XT) in Heaven Benchmark 4.0. So in overall the card does worth the price in my opinion and the cooling can be replaced with an original from a broken RX580(there are many on the web) in case the noise does count."", 'This GPU is really perfectly adequate for non gaming needs like video editing and tv watching.']"

The 7900XTX Taichi is a long and heavy card that this mount has no issues with keeping it in place and without sag.This kit has 3 sections to mount your GPU on, but if you have a 3 slot card like I do, you will not be able to use the 3rd mounting slot. If you have a 2 slot card, you should be able to use all 3 sections depending on what you have inside your build. For example, I can't use the 1st slot either since my RAMs get on the way and it's just TOO close to the motherboard.I am using this inside an O11D EVO and it fits pretty well. Not too close to my bottom fans, not too close to the side glass and not too close to the motherboard. It has also improved my temps since now my bottom fans are not choked out buy the GPU that is almost the length of 3 120mm fans. I'd give it 5 stars but I was missing some screws it was supposed to come with (according to the manual). Thankfully I still have my old case and was able to use some from there.I do recommend this item, and if you do get it, just hope you get everything that should be included."", 'Fairly easy install but if you have sausage fingers like me you’ll have a little trouble. If you also have a 4090 or other massive card, you’ll notice it still sags, which is unfortunate considering it was pretty much made for the O11 dynamic EVO. I’ve seen reviews saying they achieve better temps, but I notice no difference and I run 10 fans in my case. All in all it’s for aesthetics and it does look nice so I’d recommend.', ""First off it does offer good support for my video card, 3070 TI, however it still sags a bit and I want to say that is likely the Lian Li case's fault as the back of the case is not as thick or strong as I had hoped, and this bracket is quite robust.Now to the bracket's less than desirable qualities:1. Quality control on the PCI-E slot bracket portion is horrible, the last outer most screw hole is not even viable, and it looks like it was never even tapped. I was going to try and put a USB PCI-E card in the first slot and put my GPU in the last slot but couldn't even test if it would work (I would have to buy another extension cable).2. Quality control on the video card screw holes is also horrible, had to clear the holes out with a old mount screw so I could actually start each of the 4 screws.3. Not a quality control issue but the case mount flange requires some serious dexterity to get the screws in, maybe just my fingers are too large, but I could not put the screws in without a work around, it was just too tight. I was able to do it but there was a lot of cursing going on.4. No fault of the bracket but my liquid cooling lines and my GPU power supplies want to occupy the exact same space. Luckily, I think I was able to get a compromise with some Velcro.I am still happy with the mount, just wish it could have been better quality. Still a better option than the GPU support bracket I bought when I first got the case last year. If your case and card could support it I would go with one of those adjustable standoff style mounts.""]"

It is part of an HP Omen 25L prebuilt gaming PC which is already overpriced in retrospect. I went with the 4060 ti for convenience of not having to replace the power supply while getting a bump in performance and access to DLSS 3. First immediate difference was a reduction in fan noise due to better cooling than my previous GPU. Tested with Plague Tale Requiem settings on High DLSS on with a 1440 p LG monitor with FreeSync. I was running at 159 fps 1% lows but sometimes a noticeable stutter would occur. I looked some comparisons on YouTube and chalked it up to the lower VRAM of 8 Gb causing an occasional longer frame time due to lower memory bandwidth. I'm overall happy with the purchase but definitely think these prices are a bit outlandish for some, for me I like to spend my coin on electronics for home entertainment so not too stressed. Also this card runs on 128 bit and not 256 like my previous 3060. The upgrade to DLSS 3 was something I was focused on but if you have a 2070 or 3060 this is going to be marginally better depending on what type of games you play so take that in to consideration if you are thinking about an upgrade. Also take into consideration the length of this card, I had to do some modifications to my HP case in order to make it fit being that it was a prebuilt PC made to handle a smaller model GPU.

This card is often compared against the older 3060Ti, against which it competes pretty well all around, but the price of this one is a few dollars more. What they never mention is that this card runs about 100watts lower in power consumption. This means you don't need a big power supply and less cooling is needed.Not everyone buys a graphics card with maximum gaming speed as the sole criteria. In my case I needed to update a 10-year old machine that was running a GTX 660Ti - yes that old. I don't do much PC gaming but I do run a lot of creator related apps, like Autodesk Fusion 360, and Davinci Resolve. I needed to upgrade in order to run current CAD and video editing software reliably. The 4060Ti only needs a single PCIE power connector and its power consumption was no higher than my old card. This old PC also is running an i7-3770K, which is power hungry compared to current processors, and I was wary about adding to the PS load further. So the 4060Ti let me update graphics performance by an order of magnitude without needing to spend money on a bigger power supply or raise my electricity bill.The performance boost was very good. The PCMARK 10 benchmark of this computer was raised from 3286 with the old 660Ti to 4005 by just changing to the 4060Ti. Not stellar, but enough to keep this 10-year old computer faster than 25% of the currently benchmarked machines out there. Graphics scores were almost 10X faster, but an old SATA HDD is still holding the machine back.

It draws a LOT less power than 4070/80/90 cards. This is important to me as it produces a lot less heat.(Mine stays under 70C under load with stock fans on card). Only takes 1 8pin PCI-E supply.2. it DOES have DLSS3, which is amazing for games that support it -in some cases giving you double the FPS. Boosts me from 60FPS to almost 100 in Cyberpunk 2077 at a mix of high and ultra settings @2550 res. D4 also performing about the same.3. Raytracing is an added bonus. Improves many lighting details to make graphics pop even more @ 25504. Form factor is smaller than 3 fan versions, no space issues in case (iCue 4000X). It also has one less power cable running to it as it only needs 1 8pin supply.While i wish this had at least 10 or 12GB of VRAM (much less the 16 it should have come with), it is what it is and it is performing better than the 1660 Super i replaced.if you wanting max/ultra settings on current day games - skip this.It you are wanting to upgrade/build now and have the $400 AND aren't obessed with top tier graphics @4K and 400FPS (which you aren't if you are looking at this level of card), I'd say get this and forget the haters.If you can wait, I'd wait to see how the rest of 2023 shakes out and prices settle.I think I might be regretting it when new titles come out and 8GB isn't enough, but its working better than expected from reviews from my experience so far.Happy gaming!**Update: After owning this and running it for about 2 weeks now, I have no regrets. It stays cool under load, even at higher settings even at 1440. Cyberpunk is running 120fps (with DLSS3 on), with ultra RT and many of the settings turned to high - never tops 60C, VRAM is capped, fans don't go over 50%. D4 (while less graphics intense) is go. Handles current FPS games without issue as well.No idea how it will handle Starfield/Hogwarts/Last of Us, but Its not a 4080/4090, so I am very pleased with the consistent fps and quality and non-strain on the Wattage or Temps.Very pleased"", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0- Abstenerse de comprar esta tarjeta aquellos que - quieren actualizar su GPU y tienen actualmente desde una 3070 o inferiores, para que el salto de rendimiento valga la pena les recomendaría quedarse con su 3070 o su 3060ti míenras la 4070 baja de precio.- Compré la 4060ti a 8507 pesos mexicanos para armar una PC desde 0 y actualmente la he visto hasta en 7500, es una opción competente por el precio, la GPU para mi esta localizada en la gama media de entrada con miras de actualizarla en unos 3 o 4 años.- El rendimiento es faboluso para jugar cualquier título actual a 1080p nativo entre 60 - 100 FPS con todos los ajustes de calidad en ultra sin ningún tipo de escalador, los 8gb de vram son más que suficientes no se dejen engañar por ese argumento.- La serie RTX ofrece su escalamiento de imagen por IA (DLSS) y el frame generation (DLSS 3) qué ofrece únicamente la seríe 40, esas tecnologias te dan la oportunidad de jugar en resoluciones 2k y 4k con un desempeño y calidad buenos, el inconveniente es que no todos los juegos las implementan.Cabe destacar que el DLSS y DLSS 3 se aprovechan de manera fabulosa en conjunto de aquellos juegos que soportan Ray tracing o path tracing como cyberpunk.- Las temperaturas en situaciones de gaming demandante se mantienen entre 70 y 80 grados.- La unidad que yo adquirí fue importada desde Estados Unidos y tardó 15 días aproximadamente en llega a la Ciudad de México, la caja estaba un poco maltratada de los bordes pero la GPU llegó en perfectas condiciones dentro del empaque.Es una compra asegurada si te interesan las nuevas tecnologías de Ray tracing y full path tracing, de lo contrario hay opciones de AMD a mejor precio con rendimientos similares pero con un peor desempeño en Ray tracing.', ""It's true that this isn't a huge upgrade from the 3060 Ti it's supposed to replace...

Since many of the devices I build are smaller configurations that won't easily allow insertion and removal of a dedicated video card, this adapter fits the bill.  I ended up using it without the bracket and instead just used the adapter cable itself and it really makes it easier to get in and out of a case.

I managed to narrow it down to three. One was waaaaay overpriced, the other appeared to be unavailable for months, so I gave this one a try.If you can ignore the over-the-top styling, there is a very potent, well designed card lurking beneath the pseudo-bling. Used it for several rendering jobs, and the fans, while audible, have a nice, lower frequency thrum that's easy to ignore.With anything under a 100% load, the fans are nearly inaudible, and generally stay at 30% speed. Temps range from 27 at idle to around 40 when putting a good load on it. At full compute it hovers around 55 @ 22 ambient. That's dang good for air in my book.I've never heard of this brand before, but I'm certainly glad I gave them a shot. Best bang for the buck I've tested thus far."", ""Your going to need an E ATX case to handle this monster.  I suggest Antec or something bigger than a standard ATX configuration.

Found me a nice X570 motherboard (way better than 550) to go for a ride with.  I can overclock my RAM to almost DDR5 speeds.  That's pretty damn neat in my opinion.  The new fan it comes with works great too.  The Ryzen 5900x I have runs with the RTX 4090 very, very well.  Only 3.7% bottleneck vs. Intel's newest CPU's.  This Beast also comes with a cool looking load balancing thingy you use because the 4090 is so big that it would bend if it didn't come with the stand I Have installed that comes with the Galax 4090."", 'Have you ever run 3DMark Timespy benchmark and at the end of the run you see the ""Galax Hall of Fame"" on the statue? Well this is them and there is a reason why they are in 3DMark\'s hall of fame.The build quality is very high and if I were to measure this with another brand\'s 4090, it is reminiscent to ASUS\' Strix OC model. The shroud is quite large but does not block the heatsinks like many other models do and allows the heat to be vented unhindered. The heatsink itself seems overengineered and from my tests using the same power usage, it outperforms 240mm aio versions while using an air cooler.A bonus you will get with this model is an additional fan that you can clip onto the backplate of the gpu creating a push/pull effect on part of the heatsink increasing the airflow through the heatsink. Another bonus is a vertical gpu support to remove any sag.The 12vpwr adapter has a 4 way 8-pin split instead of 3. With the default vbios, sliding the power to 113%, the card has a maximum power draw of 508.5 watts! With this kind of power limit, you will be able to push your card with a great overclock assuming you roll a good chip. I am currently using a modest undervolt and with this great cooler I am able to stay under 60c even in a RTX title such as Darktide.I\'ve been a long time EVGA buyer, but since they\'ve stopped producing GPUs I had to look for an alternative. I think I found a good replacement to EVGA, possibly even better. At the time of writing, the Galax 4090 SG is $1649. I think it is a great deal to purchase such a premium model with so many additional features for only $49 over MSRP.', 'Fast shipping, great value and features for the price point in todays market.Outstanding performance  with an easy to use overclocking capability.

I am running games at 4k over 100 fps with ray tracing turned on.  This card is overkill for gamers running 1440p.  I would recommend a 4080 or 4070 for anyone gaming at 1440 to save a few $$.  For anyone wanting high fps at 4k however this is the card for you.  Runs very cool even when stress tested.  That extra fan to create a push pull of air was a good idea.  Yes expensive, but you get what you pay for.', 'I have always found Galax versions of cards to give the best clocks and lowest temps from any other gpu out there. The boxing is incredible and the look is fantastic as well. My Galax 1080 HOF lasted all the way to 4090 upgrade because it just overclocked so well and was able to last for 7 years for games on high graphic settings. This time, the price is actually competitive or BETTER than others out there with same great quality components.Absolutely recommend this 100% without hesitation.', 'Opening box  product is Massive both in physical size and weight! Packed extremely well +Great appearance+ in middle of build more to follow...', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Most people already know the RTX 4090 performance: 50-100% above a 3090ti, and even 30-50% above the 7900 xtx. For this model, the Galax SG specifically, it runs VERY cool for how much performance it packs:Below 30C in Idle, hardly goes above 60C even while running games/browsers on 3 monitors at once. Even right now, I have a game on one screen, a twitch stream on another and am typing this up on the middle monitor, still at 29C. As the headline for my comment above states; if you have the money, you *will not* be disappointed by this card.The LED effects on this are AWESOME. Been using it with Gigabyte Control Center and it just works SO well with all the case fans, absolutely stunning aesthetic. If LED matters to you, this card is for you.One thing to keep in mind when buying this card: Even for 4090 standards, this is on the larger end. Make sure to put this GPU + your PC Case into PC Part Picker, or check your Case specs, to make sure your case can even hold this! My old case WAS able hold a 4070ti and COULD have held a 7900 xtx, but not a 4090, so I had to buy a new case.Overall on day one; nothing short of impressed with the Galax SG RTX 4090.

It also has helped in graphics apps like Photoshop and DaVinci Resolve.The fan on the card vents straight out the back of the case, so make sure your case has room behind it. This is a massively improved design over the T400, which vented within the case.  The fan makes a small amount of noise, though it is much quieter than most background noise and not at all noticeable over music at normal volumes.  It does not affect listening to music, or mixing audio.If you are using your PC in a home recording studio and your gear is in your recording space, then you might find it a little too loud compared to a really quiet room.Note: I'm using a Dell Precision 3460 with an Intel i7 12th gen CPU and 64GB RAM.If you are wondering if this is the right card for your late model Dell SFF, it definitely is.

Unfortunately, the motherboard can't do better than PCIe Gen3, but I can confirm that the card is running at Gen3 (and is seen by Win10 as max PCI speed of Gen4).The added cost was the loss of my remaining PCIe slots, which recently bit me when I wanted to install a PCIe WiFi card.Like some other reviewers, I also had to bend metal to access the HDMI and DP ports, but it works."", 'I purchased this to use in my fractal design meshify 2 XL. It works well and they\'re still some slots to spare mostly due to the size of my case. For pros, this has a nice support pad on the underside of the tray. It allows you to move the PCIE connector position on the mount which is a nice plus. It is sizable enough to accommodate three slot graphics cards. The riser cable is malleable enough to bend to the position it needs to and also hold its position fairly well. I don\'t have a motherboard that has PCIE 4.0. So I can\'t speak to that at this time. It works perfectly well though, with my Fatal1ty motherboard and EVGA 1080ti.  Now for some cons. The bracket is assembled with small Phillips head screws, but alignment of the parts is the issue here, I had to bend some of the metal a little bit to get the connections lined up. It\'s stamped steel so that\'s not too difficult. But if you\'re not careful in making sure that everything is lined up and you start putting it together, you will quickly find portions that don\'t line up and you have to take it back apart and manipulate it together. It also means that once you have everything put together you will have to then manipulate it into your slots in your case because now it is slightly warped. Mine is down low enough where it rests on the PSU shroud however, I could see sag being a problem if you mounted it higher up as there are only three, maybe 1/4"" long screws, that made the tray to the face. Definitely something to keep in mind.  Overall it\'s not a bad setup. It does exactly what it\'s supposed to do. As long as you can work with the couple of flaws that it has, you\'ll be good. When eventually upgrade my system and move on to PCIE 4.0 I will update my review accordingly.', ""I have been trying to find a solution that would allow me to install my RTX4080, and my RTX3060 and the same time since the RTX4080 is sooo large, taking up 4 slots, that it blocks my 2nd PCIe x16 slot by just a few millimeters. I knew getting this that if it worked, I would need to cut away the metal plates in the back of my case to make room for it and I was willing to do that if it worked, but I have tried two different adapters so far, the first being meant for PCIe 3.0 and hoped that was the reason for why it was not working right, but getting this product which is meant for 4.0 seems to confirm it is some other issue.While it seems to work fine for the GPU itself and did allow me to have my 3060 installed (gaming, rendering, and burn-in testing appeared to work okay), it would cause all my other devices in my computer to constantly disconnect and reconnect, including hard drives, USB controllers, Wifi, so on. I could hear my HDD's just clicking over and over as they disconnected/reconnect and my mouse/keyboard would constantly drop and reconnect.I don't know if my motherboard is just too sensitive to allow a cable like this work right with such a beast of a GPU or what. I even tried forcing the bios settings to Gen3, but nothing worked. It works fine with the RTX 3060, but that is a pretty6 low powered card compared to the 4080. In the end I was forced to modify my new 4080 by cutting enough room on the plastic covering so I could use my other 3.0 extension adapter with the 3060, while keeping my 4080 installed normally.I am not sure I can fault the product itself since it did happen with 2 different brands, but clearly there is some strange thing that prevents it from working right which is why I have to give it 4 stars. I really wish I could have used this adapter so I did not need to void my new GPU's warranty, but whoever designed it was a moron as it prevented anything from being installed a 2nd PCIe slot. I hate returning things but I may be forced to do so since it did not solve the problem of everything disconnecting on me when it was installed, and I just have no use for it now."", ""Tried this out and was hoping for my Ark A770 build it would be a good contender for my Corsair case. But didn't mount correctly and was causing a weird ground out, refunded. Might be perfect for you, but wasn't for me sadly. Was not compatible with the Corsair iCUE 4000X RGB Mid-Tower ATX PC Case - Black."", 'Es muy buen producto, sin embargo tuve problemas con la PC, se me apaga sin razon, pensé que era la fuente sin embargo quitando el riser, funciono perfectamente, supongo que algún conector estaba provocando la falla, pero quitando eso es buen producto, solo hay que mejorar el cable riser', ""The riser cable's a bit stiff and overly long, making it tricky to tuck it behind the bracket so that it's not so visible, but once I managed to do that, the rest of the installation went well. It's a solid device, and its clearances are perfect for a mid-tower with a full-size ATX motherboard. It won't allow the use of other PCIe slots behind it, but I imagine many if not most builds these days don't really need them anyway. I think it could be a bit less pricey too, but all in all, I can't really find any deal-breaking faults. I recommend it."", ""Nice quality, easy install, (note: if your entire slot bracket for gpu doesn't come out, you may need to modify your case.)

The fans are quiet, even at full RPM. However, there's not a ton of air movement like normal case fans. The light up letter can use your MB's 3 pin ARGB connector to sync with your case's lighting. The screws on the holders sandwich the GPU to the bracket, and that's the only thing holding this in place. The bottom just has a rubber pad with no screws or magnets.

Do not hesitate to RMA this card if you have those weird issues. With everything working now I can say I definitely like this card a lot.

El único inconveniente que le veo es que jala bastante poder, necesitas una buena fuente, al menos 850w para estar cubierto, fuera de eso es una excelente tarjeta por el precio, más barata que la 4080.', ""When I say I was VERY excited to test out my first ever Radeon card, I could barely contain myself opening up the box to put it into my system. For context, my current motherboard is an MSI Meg X570 Unify running a Ryzen 5800X3D and 32GB of 4000MHZ memory. I wasn't happy with my previous 4070ti's performance (which also had HORRENDOUS COIL WHINE) so I figured why not pay a little bit more for double the VRAM (yes, I know VRAM isn't everything), and try out AMD's flagship card to see if it really is a 4080 contender.Short story: I'm returning this hunk of junk and my Gigabyte 4080 arrives in just a few days (which I am now VERY excited for because the 4070ti was already a solid card, and this one should be just perfect for my system's needs.Long story: I'm actually kind of a fan of these huge graphics cards, even if they are a bit ridiculous. This is definitely the biggest card I've ever seen, and this TUF card weighs in around 7.5 POUNDS on its own. Sheesh. It BARELY fit into my NZXT H5 Flow case, but I will admit that the fitment is very satisfying even if its size isn't necessarily ideal. The massive size of the card definitely warrants lots of cooling, so the cooling performance can be credited.I've heard about Tuf Gaming cards before, in terms of build quality, it's excellent, looks attractive, and again, feels premium. Unfortunately, my worst fears were realized when I booted my system and attempted to use the card. Not only are AMD's current graphic drivers unstable, but the card genuinely performs worse in every way than the 4070ti that is supposed to be SEVERAL tiers below this card. Ironically, lowering quality presets in certain games also seemed to worsen my performance even more. Gaming at 1440p, I noticed horrible stuttering, texture artifacts, and arguably the worst coil whine on a graphics card I have ever heard. It's unacceptable. For a flagship card, I am incredibly disappointed with AMD. I had high expectations for this card's performance (I know it's no 4090), but my outgoing 3070 never broke a sweat most of the time, and this card can barely play Halo or Call of Duty at medium settings. 24 GB of VRAM! 24! And the card performs like it only has 8 and I'm using almost all of it. It's pathetic. The coil whine doesn't appear to be fixable, even with undervolting. I have a 1000W PSU from Corsair that is Platinum rated. Nothing about my system is misplaced or problematic. I clean installed the graphics drivers and updated my Windows 10.It's a shame. I was looking forward to this card, but also looking forward to not giving Nvidia more money, but sadly, Nvidia's driver support is just more reliable and the performance of the 40 series card is just better.Don't get me wrong, there may be good 7000 series cards out there, but this TUF card isn't one of them.

For someone who wears headphones, this card is a great deal.There are two cons that I\'ve come across, and I have a feeling they\'re both on the QC side of the house. When initially installing it, I thought it was fully seated, but when I powered it up, it would power cycle itself. I put my 1070 in and it worked just fine, so I knew the problem was this card. After looking it over, I noticed the ""tab"" end of the bracket was bent, so I straightened it out and it now works just fine. The card did seem well-packaged, and the big box the whole order came in wasn\'t damaged, so the bracket must\'ve been bent at the factory. I\'m assuming these are mass-tested in open air systems, so the bent tabs wouldn\'t have been noticed; otherwise the only explanation is someone in QC knew it was bent and shipped it anyways.After getting it running, I noticed that the fans make a pretty annoying amount of coil whine. I know for sure it\'s these fans because I ran the system using Intel\'s on-chip graphics, and then the 1070, and never heard any fan noise. But after running this for a few hours, the noise was annoying enough that I\'m actually sending the card back and going with a different brand. I didn\'t notice the whine when I had music playing, but I am often in meetings or classes where I don\'t wear headphones, and there\'s no way I\'d be able to focus with this sound in my head.

As expected, performance is not as incredible as many of the games run in 80-100fps in high settings, probably because of the bandwidth issue that many people report thunderbolt 3 has. Still, great performance out of the box and a slight overclock (100mhz core - 400mhz memory, for best stability)The card never goes above 300w consumption with my current settings, so I deem the 3 cable unnecessary tbh, I'm spent a couple of days testing with a Y splitter to convert the 3-pin connector to the 2-pin that the Razer Core X has (not sure if this hinders performance but like I said, for me it's fine)and there is no signs of overheating on the connectors nor in the cables, because temperature oscillates between 270 celsius and 290 celsius. Transients spikes get to 310w but I don't think they will be a problem since they last for a couple of ms and the PSU is 650w with nothing else taking power from it (except the fan which is like less than 10w consumption).Overall, card is running great, fits inside the Razer Core X perfectly and there is no signs of overwattage on the cables or the connectors at all, even with this being the OC version and using a Y-splitter from the 16-pin of the card to the 2x8pin from the Razer Core X.Maybe not worth the 1.2k CAD for running it in a eGpu but hey, the big win about the 40xx over the 30xx is the power consumption, it's much lower and that makes it perfect for the PSU of the Razer Core X, and if I ever decide to build an ITX or a bigger desktop, then I'm covered for the future, so I'm happy with my purchase.I purchased my Y-splitter from Amazon as well and the one I got is a COMeap GPU VGA PCIe 8 Pin Female to Dual 2x 8 Pin (6+2) male PCI Express Power Adapter Braided Y-Splitter extension cable 9-inch (23cm)"", ""Last spring I purchased a Zotac RTX 3070 Ti 8GB video card from Amazon.

I originally paired this gpu with a  EVGA 750+ Watt Gold, purchased 2 years ago, to run this build. However the 750 Watts was not adequate for my build. This could be for any number of reasons that I have not confirmed. I upgraded to a 1200 Corsair for upgrading measures. I know it is very overkill. I want to inform other pc buildings that 750 watts power supply may not be enough power. I got my power supply estimated wattage from PC Part Picker. The 750 Watt should have been enough, but the build couldn't run any AAA games until I installed my upgraded power supply. This review is not to bash EVGA by any means. I had a hunch that I would have to upgrade the power supply and that was confirmed by my build running smoothly.

Lo ritengo un pezzo che si concentra più sull'estetica e dare un tocco più aggressivo al PC. Peccato non poterla utilizzare"", 'Like most people I wanted to get a GPU support bracket/brace to ""help"" my GPU from sagging in my case. Luckily, the GPU I have doesn\'t sag too much but just enough to where a support brace would help. Plus a sagging GPU doesn\'t look that great.This support brace kit is a complete kit for supporting your GPU and even includes RGB that I think is a nice touch. It does have RGB but it\'s not over-the-top and you could just leave it unplugged if you don\'t want the RGB.What I really love about this bracket kit is that it can be adjusted in so many different places to accommodate many different cases and GPU\'s. The length and width of the bracket can be adjusted which helps line up to support your GPU. I also love that just about everything in this kit is metal and built very well.This bracket uses an arm at the top which sits right under the GPU for support. It also uses an arm at the bottom that sits at the bottom of your case to help keep everything supported. Putting everything together I realized that this setup isn\'t going to work in my situation because I have a set of 3 fans at the bottom. There\'s just no place to put the bottom arm for the support. So keep this in mind when looking to get this kit for your setup.Even though I can\'t use this kit it doesn\'t take away from how well it\'s built and how it would support just about every GPU out there. It\'s my fault for not looking closer before getting this setup. It\'s one of the better looking, better built support brackets I\'ve seen and would have in my case if it wasn\'t for my fans at the bottom.']"

It overclocked easily to 3GHz and has never exceeded 51C so the liquid cooling is definitely a plus. I read other reports of the fan based models operating at 60+C with associated noise. This has been whisper quiet.Although this is $200 more than the Windforce, this Waterforce was worth the price difference. Had I gone with a manual water cooling solution, the water block would add another $129 plus pipes, tank, etc. and it would easily exceed the price difference. I also considered the 4090 Waterforce but an additional $1000 (50% more expensive) for 25-30% performance gain didn't seem worth it. Now that I've tested it I think the 4080 OC is the sweet spot on price/performance.For FS2020 and Pimax fans- Using Wide FOV, clouds on Ultra, and many other settings on High/Ultra. i9-13900K (also liquid cooled) probably helps but this is a major improvement over my previous RTX 3090 model and the game is finally playable in VR at high  resolutions.The fans come pre-installed on the radiator but they can be moved to the opposite side if needed (which was required in my setup- pictured on left. Be warned- even though the graphics card is shorter, the radiator is full size and you need a large case to hold it all. In my case the Thermaltake case did the job.

The only things about this case that are toolless is the side and front panels; to be fair, I didn't see them advertising a toolless design, but there was a lot of screws that had to be taken out before I could start. The only things that I would change is having the ability to completely remove the top of the case for radiator mounting, and also to have the ability to turn the piece on the front panel around to make more room for a radiator. Other than those things I have no complaints. It gives you plenty of options for fan placement, they even have a spot behind the CPU for a 120mm fan, which I don't know how much of a difference this could make for CPU temps, but it couldn't hurt. The radiator on the top is a Deep Cool Castle 360ex and it fit just fine, also it's cooling a Ryzen 9 7900x if you were wondering if that radiator works on am5 motherboards, it does. It came with an instruction booklet, but I didn't have time to really look at it before my wife cleaned up and lost it, so I couldn't tell you how helpful it was, but I figured it out. There wasn't anything too hard about breaking the case down. The front panel pops off, and and so do the side panels, easy peasy. Overall I am very satisfied with this case.

The case I got was the ""T3"" - there isn\'t much documentation on it. There also isn\'t many reviews, anywhere. I do plan to edit this later and add details.As far as the quality, I was pleasantly surprised to see the level of detail that is in this case. I kept expecting to find that thing that wasn\'t thought of but kept finding the contrary. They truly thought of just about everything. While they claim tool-less design, it\'s not actually like that. In example, the top radiator mount requires screws to be taken out, same with the hard drive mounting solution. But the freedom this case gives you is really quite awesome. And I\'ve never seen a case, in my life, plan for and accommodate a fan behind the motherboard. And it truly is awesome for thermals.In fact, this case has so much cooling potential it\'s unreal. I came from an NZXT H500i - completely blocked off front end. I ran the PC with the tempered glass off 98% of the time and it was still too hot. This case, however, is amazing. My 10900K is now running lower temperatures than it was before despite having an additional +200mhz (was 5.1 all core, now 5.3 all core), and the highest I saw while gaming was maybe 74*. I can\'t fathom what the temperasture would be if I left it at 5.1ghz. Since I don\'t have a picture ready, I have 3x Coolermaster Duo-Ring 140\'s in the front, and NZXT Kraken X62 with Noctua 140\'s on the top, the 120 that comes with the case as rear exhaust, and a Noctua blowing at the back of the motherboard on the hard drive/fan mount.There\'s not many cons, as the accessories come with everything you need, including rubber dust plugs for every front panel port, which is awesome for those of us who never use them and they fill with dust. The instructions are, as expected, the most horrific English writing you\'ll see. And the USB 3.0 for the front panel didn\'t have it\'s holes properly bored out causing me to nearly bend my motherboard pins until I decided I don\'t even want it.But for now, I\'m going to 100% recommend it.

It also has room to add an extra fan for the bottom slots even though they don’t support bottom slots but you can still add an extra fan at the bottom and It’s not on the manufacturing guide it’s just optional thing that you can do. The most impressive thing about this case is the fact that you have options to add one 140s or one 120s fan for the front panel to pull more fresh air in and you could also add a CPU fan in the back of the PC case which can exhaust out the hot air from the cpu socket which gives you better temperatures. I would recommend that they make a gpu mount that supports a RTX 4090 because I did struggle putting the 4090 on the gpu mount but the majority’s of GPU’s shouldn’t have this issue since they won’t be wide enough to grind against the Ram sticks. Also I will give props to the design because it was easy to install everything. For most parts which needed screws… I’ll just say this you don’t need to screw everything in as if the case parts already holds itself once it’s put back in it’s designated spot which is really good for easy replacements.', ""-  The removable pieces have to be unscrewed.  The bolts are tiny and tight.  It is not toolless.-  I'm concerned about getting the case put together.  There's about 7 pieces that will come out.  Instructions are so tiny they are illegible.  There are no installation videos.  It's like a puzzle.-  I thought I could put a LF2-360 r7 Arctic AIO in the top.  I cannot.  It hits the header on the ASUS MB.  Will have to do a side mount, but really wanted a horizontal mount on the top.-  Opening the front windows makes it noisy.-  The top panel has small holes for air flow, and it acts as a flow restrictor.-  Too much glass.  A stupid trend.  My PC isn't for looks.This was a mistake for me.  I was hoping for an intelligent case with simple mounting for a top-mounted AIO and good noise control.  What I got was a complicated case with pop-out sides and windows so I can hear it better, and that won't fit the Arctic cooler in the top.  I thought the extra cost would provide extra benefit; a classier build.  Cable management looks pretty nice, and I like the PSU closet, and the size and color are great.  Just not what I  was hoping for.*******************************************************************************************************************More fun.  It does NOT support dual water coolers, at least not the Arctic LF2-360r7 with 3 fans.  I intended to mount the cooler on the top where a removeable tray was provided, but there is not enough room.  The ASUS Tuf Gaming Z790-Plus WIFI MB is in the way.  So I mounted it on the side, which works without the removeable tray.  Next I tried to mount my Ironwolf Pro 18TB HDD on the drive tray.  It doesn't fit in the case with the drive on it.  It hits the MB tray.  It should mount UNDER the MB on a bare tray.  There are NO DRIVE BAYS.  There's no place to mount the Ironwolf HDD.  The MB header is just half wired (no Speaker, Intrusion Detect).The power supply is mounted at the bottom of the case and exhausts to the floor with about an inch of space, so not bad.  It's in it's own little perforated metal closet with a bunch of holes.  Probably one of the only things I like about the case.  I also liked that rubber washers were included for the HDD tray, which wasn't usable.I build and maintain computers professionally, for 30 years plus.  Fortunately, there are a lot sections in the Water Cooler mounting tray that only mounts at the top of the case (I couldn't use it), so I can rig up something to hold the HDD.  Never saw a case this bad, and have now learned to look closely at the design before purchasing.  I've just never seen anything this stupid."", ""It's to small for all wires and I am not happy for it's"", 'I was hesitant given the price but I am very happy with the results.  As you can see cable management is nice and clean and if I wanted to add a water cooler to my GPU I even have room to do that as well.  The side panels pop on and off easily.  I thought that might be an issue but once you are done they stay on just fine.  Ventilation is very good.  I will be surprised if I ever have heating issues because of the case.', 'Absolutely An amazing case. Very easy to build your pc in. Plenty of room. We had an indecent with my 2yr old right after I bought it and they were very understanding and was able to get everything fixed without an issue. Amazing company and will be doing a lot of business with them!!! Thank you guys again!!!']"

Dies dürfte wichtig für Käufer sein, die Wert auf hohe Performance legen und sich am Ende mehr vom Artikel versprechen.Meine Erfahrung zum Artikel:Der Artikel kam in einem schlichten Pappkarton, mit einem Stromkabel und einem wenig hilfreichen Zettel mit Hinweis zur Treiberinstallation (gebrochenes Englisch mit Chinesischen Abbildungen). Eine Treiber-CD lag nicht bei. Der Karton wurde augenscheinlich wohl bereits einmal zuvor geöffnet, da das Kartonklebeband beschädigt war.Zunächst hat die Karte nach Installation passender Treiber aus dem Internet funktioniert. Unter höherer Last kam es dann aber zu Bildstörungen (Flackern und vertikale Streifen). Nach einem Rechnerneustart ließ sich nur noch das BIOS aufrufen; ein Start von Win10 endete während des Bootvorgangs dann immer mit einem schwarzen Bildschirm.Meine Erfahrungen mit dem Verkäufer Cuifati:Zunächst sei angemerkt, dass die Kommunikation etwas zäh ist, da der Verkäufer immer erst am Folgetag antwortet; völlig egal, ob man sofort auf eine Nachricht reagiert. Damit zog sich die Kommunikation mit der Bitte um Support länger hin.Habe dem Verkäufer gewünschte Fotos vom Fehlerbild und ein Video der Bootsequenz gesendet.Statt weiteren Fragen zur PC-Ausstattung, zum BIOS oder gar der Zusendung eines vielleicht geeigneten Treibers kam nur das Angebot einer teilweisen Rückerstattung in Höhe von 20 Euro (!). Nachdem ich dieses ""Angebot"" kritisch hinterfragt habe (20 Euro bringen schließlich die Karte nicht zum Laufen!), hat der Verkäufer es......auf 40 Euro erhöht (!?!).Zwischenzeitlich hatte von einem fachkundigen Bekannten erfahren, dass dieser Grafikkartentyp durchaus Probleme mit einigen gängigen BIOS Versionen haben könnte. Er bot sich aber an, die um 40 Euro reduzierte Karte von mir zu übernehmen und zu testen.Da ich um Grunde überhaupt kein Freund von Retouren bin, da sie für alle beteiligten unnötig Aufwand und Mehrkosten bedeuten, habe ich das Angebot der Teilerstattung in Höhe von 40 Euro akzeptiert und dies dem Verkäufer mitgeteilt.Dieser indes macht dann aber plötzlich einen Rückzieher, will sich nicht mehr an seine Zusage halten und verweist auf die Amazon Rücksendungsoption. Auf die nochmalige Bitte um die zuvor zugesagte Teilerstattung und das Behalten der Ware reagiert er dann gar nicht mehr.Mir bleibt nun nur noch das Rückholen der Grafikkarte (leider etwas umständlich für mich) und dann letztlich doch die Retoure an Amazon. Glücklicherweise bleibt mir noch genügend Zeit dafür.Fazit: Finger weg von diesem Artikel und dem Verkäufer Cuifati, wenn man das Risiko der oben geschilderten Erfahrung vermeiden möchte.

El Hellhound es mas frio que el Devil, por lo que no tendras problemas si noe s liquida tu ventilacion.El gpu hace ruido al jugar al maximo, pero no es molesto el ruido, ya que tenia un Ps4 y vaya que sonaba como avion con los ultimos juegos como god of war, ese si hace ruido en verdad.El psu que te recomiendan es de 800 watts y estuve usando uno de 750 watts, no exploto pero se sentia en ratos que jaloneaba, lei por ahi que el problema con estas nuevas tarjetas de gama alta tanto amd como nvidia, son picos de potencia espontaneos.

Aqui no hay ese problema siempre la detecta sin fallo alguno.Recomendacion:Si tu gabinete cabe muy apenas la tarjeta, por milimetros, si tu psu es bajo, recomiendo actualizarlos antes de cambiar a xtx, ya que demandan mucho espacio para ventilacion y buena fuente d epoder para estabilidad, si tienes gabinete pequeño y un psu de 750 watts todo esta bien para la 7900 xt.', 'Realmente tenía mis dudas sobre esta tarjeta, la adquirí por sus tremendas características lo que le da cierta longevidad al menos por un buen tiempo, sin embargo a medida que la he ido usando me he ido dando cuenta de lo robusta que es, puede con todo con un rendimiento óptimo, leo mucho de ruido pero al menos la mía hace el ruido necesario y no es molesto, en juegos muy demandantes, llevo un mes con ella, y puedo decir que estoy satisfecho, han hecho un par actualizaciones de software y no ha hecho más que mejorar, ahora con con FSR 3.0 creo que es el mejor momento para obtener una, debo aclarar que soy solo un entusiasta de video juegos por lo que quizás si buscas más, probablemente no demás guiarte por mi opinión, pero para quienes disfrutan los videojuegos y no cuentan cada FPS, que ojo, no es que no lo valga, está es una gran opción, aunque debo decir que si he hecho mediciones por morbo y como dije al principio está maquinita ni se despeina frente a ningún juego, con la última actualización su desempeño en Ray tracing que es la gran critica de muchos, ha mejorado, por lo que su potencial es grande.

So, you can achieve better timings (The LOWER the BETTER) On DDR3 VS. DDR4. My build is above. DDR3 at 2400 MHZ is DDR4 speed but with much better timings. I researched a review that put 2400 MHZ at the sweet spot for Memory on gaming. Anything Higher was a waste, and anything lower really sucked.So here I am in the same boat but with much better Memory. All my games worked fine except 1 (War THUNDER). I did a test drive of an Israeli Tank to test the game with the new card and drivers (Highest Settings) and it restarted my PC. As in all Science I had to recreate the same conditions. It happened again. I Knew it was because the POWER FEAUTURES of my PSU! In the Morning I got a 1000W Platinum PSU and had to take my Computer apart and put it back together! WHEW! It sucks. But IT WORKED! Got it all right the first shot (And some good cable Management). YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT IM TELLING YOU NOW!On a 2k 144HZ FreeSync Monitor I\'m 201 frames/sec in War Thunder with no glitches! IT GETS BETTER! Rome 2 Total War test is at 119 FPS. All games look and play magnificent! But my CPU USAGE STAYS AT 25%! I\'ve tested, retested, used several programs! All Confirm that the most CPU usage I use with a i7 4790k with DDR3 2400 MHZ case 10 and manually set to a 1T command rate is MAX 28% at 2K.

Otherwise it can reach near 90°c J.temps / 70°c Edge temps. But it does so at only 1200rpm.At 1600rpm or so I still couldn't hear the card over my 140mm CPU fans. And the temps were good. About 80 J.temp/ 62 E.temp on 360 watts.Main issue with the card is that the backplate gets VERY warm while gaming.In general the GPU produces a lot of heat as is expected with a 300+ watts card. The heatsink is fairly exposed as well.This affects my CPU temps and is only mitigated by adding an extra exhaust fan or opening the side panel after long gaming sessions. Otherwise your case will get very hot so make sure your airflow is good.As for coil whine it's definitely audible but not too bad. Can't hear it with my headphones. It's only audible when you go above 150 fps~ but some units are better than others"", 'I got this on-sale for about 880 best purchase I ever made I used this card for my first ever PC build and it looked so beautiful in the case and ran like a beast!', ""The Good: Performance is better than expected. I am unsure if the clocks I am seeing is an accurate reading as they seem too high to be true. With the OC bios, I am seeing normally 2700 Mhz on the core and up to 2900 Mhz depending on the situation. Much higher than the 2525 Mhz advertised for boost clock. This could be determined on the specific scene requirements. I haven't seen it reach over 65c either. I do have 2 T30 fans blowing right on it though, so air flow is no limit. Built like a tank and includes an anti-sag attachment.The bad: I hope you don't like high refresh rate gaming as the coil whine at high FPS is atrocious. The worst I have had in years, since my HIS 7970 GHz GPU.  100% load at 4k isn't bad, just when the FPS goes over 90 does the whine become a drag. My system is tuned for silence with high static pressure fans to ensure maximum cooling with minimal noise. This coil whine is made all the more apparent."", 'I\'m only playing GW2 currently.  Between my EVGA 1080Ti FTW3, AMD 6900XT and PowerColor 7900XTX, they are all EFFECTIVELY the same playing GW2.  Yes, both AMD GPUs permit more eye candy, but not $1000 worth.  My suggestion is to grab while you can, a 6950 for $699.99.  On paper, everything is slower than Nvidias top 2 GPUs, but effectively? nah.  There is a support bar included which is a nice quality of life feature.  My PC case is Corsairs\' Carbide Air 540 and no issues fitting the GPU in.  My AIO is in the roof.  Not enough room to front mount a radiator.  I can not say how well it does with Tomb Raider as I am unable to get past the intro.  I have yet to re-play Elder Scrolls with either AMD GPU, but very little was left on the table with my 1080Ti.  My ""monitor"" is Hisense 55U8G which ended up replacing my ROG PG279 (27"" 165hz 1440 IPS).  Do NOT feed the scalpers!  As the various 6950\'s launched for $1100, paying $999 for a mildly upgraded 7900XTX did not feel unreasonable....not cheap, but not unreasonable.  Save some cash and get effectively the same performance with a $700 6950.For what I do, any of the new GPUs are overkill.  Nice, performs well and not obscenely priced.  I also have no interest in RT and neither should any of you until they figure out how to not tank performance for a bit of bling.  I suspect the 24g of ram will more than suffice as long as the card lives.']"

I've had it for about a month now and its been getting a workout playing Cyberpunk 2077 and Diablo 4 in 2k.Pros:Performance. Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing overdrive. Need I say more? This card will and should take the vast majority of any games you can throw at it right now maxing out nearly everything even in 4k. If you need more 4090 is always an option but for the price I struggle to think you will find much this card can't do at the moment.Fantastic build quality. This card feels so much better in your hand than my previous gigabyte 3070TI. ASUS TUF continues to impress me in this regard.Easy install as long as you have the space. You will want to be sure to check your case these 40 series cards are massive.Super quiet. I experienced no issues with wine or fan noise from this card even under heavy load its rare I hear it.Great cooling. Card was designed with cooling in mind. Unfortunately, it's bigger because of that but the reality is this card just doesn't get hot. At idle mine sits around 30C when under intense load it will sometimes get up in the 60C range, but I have yet to see it get much higher.Cons:Size won't work for everyone's case. Check it first. I have a Corsair Airflow 4000d and it fits with about .5 inch between the front fans.Pricing is still out of reach for many people. Would be nice to see these cards become more accessible for the average gamer again.New cards are power hungry. You will want to use a PSU calculator and be sure your PC is set. There are several solid ones to find with a quick Google search."", ""So you're considering upgrading your GPU. There's plenty of options around, but gosh darn, those prices are steep! Is a modern GPU really worth the expense?Well, it depends...If you're the average computer user and like to watch movies or do some social media posting, with occasional email and web browsing, then no. This GPU is severely overkill. It would be overpriced and you would never utilize the immense list of features and capabilities it offers. Could be more beneficial investing in an Intel GPU if you really want to upgrade your setup and stay ahead of the obsolescence avalanche.If you're a gamer, however - or perhaps a video editor, or 3D CGI creator, or Videographer content creator, then this GPU, the ASUS TUF Gaming RTX4080 16GB might be a good fit for you. Yes, it's expensive, but it's a powerful and vastly capable card. As someone who does photo/video/audio restoration and conversion, this GPU runs major circles around my previous GPU (and RTX2060). I can render photo enhancements almost instantly, and render videos in a fraction of the time (especially using nVidia's increasingly popular AV1 codec - exclusive to the 4000 series RTX GPUs).And gaming? Fuggedaboudit......  I can max out every setting in Cyberpunk 2077 @ 4K resolution and this thing eats it up like candy - even in the most graphically demanding areas of the game - and still gets at least 90-100+fps. Same with every other game I've thrown at it so far (not a small list of RTX games, either). Game after game after game, and this GPU never balks. It just powers through each one with flying colors.So why not get the RTX4070? None of the 4070 models really push the limits like the 4080. Are they not worth it? By no means - the 4070 cards are also capable GPUs in their own right. They just don't do quite enough, in my opinion, to justify the cost.What about the RTX4090? Quite simply because they don't produce enough power over the 4080 to justify their cost, either. And they suck significantly more power than the 4080 - without significant differences in capabilities.Simply put, the RTX 4080 - specifically the ASUS TUF Gaming 16GB GPU hits ALL the sweet spots for me. It's just the finest GPU I've ever had the pleasure of owning and using. And if you're a content creator like me, your revenue should easily justify the cost of this beast GPU, considering the amount of time you'll same rendering material.Do I recommend this GPU? 100%. Buy one before they're all gone - and the prices spike again.(Also, I do not work for nor am I sponsored by any company. This is my own personal, honest opinion on this product, as a small business owner and content creator.) Hope the info helps! Happy shopping!"", 'After going with the cheapest gigabyte and zotac cards I was very disappointed. They ran hot, sounded like jets taking off, and the zotac constantly had to be RMAed. I decided to spend a little more this time. This card has much better cooling than my zotac 3090 which used more power than this even does. Hottest GPU temp I have ever recorded for this is 62c. It runs 2805+ gpu clock constantly and never ever goes below that with no overclock. I hope asus always keeps this line this good because I never want to buy another brand again.', ""I've tested this GPU well with Blender, benchmarks and some games as well. Despite leaving it rendering large projects and long-running benchmarks (and games too), it doesn't seem to go above 65-66 degrees C, even on the hot day that I've tested it on. The oversized cooler is a bit inconvenient as it covers a few other PCIe connectors, but it wasn't an issue for me with an ATX motherboard and a WiFi NIC on the final PCIe connector.It's a bit of a shame that the GPU Tweak III software doesn't work on Linux, but there are alternatives for its more important features. The amount of GPU memory has not been an issue with anything I've tested, even rendering in extremely high resolutions and the ray-tracing boost in performance makes work in Blender possible in the live render view.It was definitely possible to make the heatsink thinner without increasing the maximum reached temperature by much. Sound-wise, the fans only start spinning at ~50 degrees C and are very quiet.As an added note, when the GPU is connected to power (PSU is providing it power and connected to the wall, even when the PC is off), there is a red light on the GPU which initially seemed like some sort of error indicator, but there's nothing in its manual suggesting that and since the GPU is performing well, I can only guess it is a power indicator. I'm not certain why it was required, but if it bugs you, it's possible to cover that LED with a non-conductive material that blocks light and is not particularly affected by nearby high temperatures (40-50 degrees C)."", ""Whether it's rendering or gaming, this card can handle it no problems.Fair warning before you even consider purchasing this graphics card (Or any 40X0 series NVidia card)This Card is MASSIVE. And I mean MAAAAAAAAAASSIVE. It measures somewhere around 378mm long, meaning that if the case you love or a case you're looking at has some sort of hard drive cage or water cooler mount of some kind at the front, you're going to have to get rid of it. Not only that, but due to its massive heatsinks and fans, it's also going to block most of your PCI Express slots so if you're hoping to have an expansion card of some kind in the pcie 1 slot, you're out of luck. Your only other option is to vertical mount the card but refer to the first sentence of this paragraph."", 'Absolutely love this thing. I have a 2k ultra wide monitor and it works perfectly with it. 144fps at ultra on warzone. Marvelous', ""The Asus TUF RTX 4080 graphics card is an absolute powerhouse that delivers stunning performance and exceptional stability, making it an excellent choice for serious gamers and professionals alike. This graphics card is a true marvel, boasting incredible speed and raw power that easily surpasses the RTX 3090 Ti, which is an impressive feat in and of itself.One of the standout features of this card is its massive size and weight, which is a testament to its superior build quality and durability. The card is not only physically impressive, but it's also designed with a sleek and modern aesthetic that looks great in any gaming setup. While it may not have as many RGB lights as some other cards on the market, its boxy design is still very visually appealing and looks great in any case.Another noteworthy aspect of the Asus TUF RTX 4080 graphics card is its remarkably quiet operation. Thanks to its large fans, the card stays cool and quiet even under heavy load, making it perfect for extended gaming sessions or other demanding workloads. This quiet operation is especially impressive given the card's incredible performance capabilities, as other high-performance graphics cards often produce a lot of noise when pushed to their limits.Overall, the Asus TUF RTX 4080 graphics card is an exceptional piece of hardware that offers top-tier performance, exceptional build quality, and a sleek and modern design.

My uses (as it pertains specifically to the GPU) are personal / non professional. I use a LG 34 ultrawide 3880x1440 @ 144hz as main display (although this unit does drive my 2560x1444@144hz display as well (and occasionally a cheapy 1080 TV for youtube)My concerns going into the purchase were power consumption (and the resultant waste heat in a climate / housing situation that necessitates air conditioning) as well as the size and potential noise.The thing is absolutely massive. Its 7mm longer than my Fractal Define XL R2 case- which natively supports a 330mm card without removing the HD chassis. So, after discarding the HD chassis I was able to fit this 337mm card (admittedly with about 145mm to spare)Its big, its heavy, its substantive. you absolutely will be accounting for the size- in more ways than one. The size allows for larger heat sinks and the triple fan design, so its not entirely (or at all) a drawback if you can accommodate it.I undervolted my card and can run modern games fully maxed without going above 60c- usually substantially lower. In most cases, even after longer sessions, I don\'t see temperatures past the 40s. My case a good amount of airflow, though, so its fairly adept at ditching the heat, especially given the engineering of the cooling for the GPU.the card idles and handles light gaming tasks at 29-30C, lol. although its rated for 320w i dont think ive seen it grab more than 250 or so while gaming. its definitely interesting to watch the power use change in real time, even from level to level in a game, depending on optimization and whats going on around it, but the performance itself has never dropped- it just uses more gas.overall i\'m pleasantly surprised by what i was able to achieve in both a power use as well as cooling. its not necessarily amazing to have a ""cold"" GPU when idling, but it runs colder than my triple fan EVGA 1080ti does both under load and while just hanging outit really is huge compared to older gen cards- even the larger ones. but, all the dimensions of both your case and the card are available to view before you make any decisions. if youre cocky about your case like i was, it may still be worth double checking if youll have to remove any cages or rearrange things though- my case is likely in the top 95th percentile for consumer case sizes and i still had to make adjustments.I paired this with a 1kW PSU coming from a 750w, and i can say thats overkill for the setup. 850 would have been fine, even paired with my  RAM/CPU combo- the latter of which also undervolted quite nicely.', 'La tarjeta es enorme tenlo en mente al comprarla tiene un rgb ligero nada extraordinario es muy fresca jugando en 4k no pasa de 65 grados, tampoco hace mucho ruido sin duda ha sido una excelente compra hice update de mi 3080 y sentí el doble de rendimiento claro con dlss y más con frame generation', ""Very fast and power efficient card, runs cooler than the previous generation due to the massive heatsink and lower TDP. it runs everything in Ultra setting for 1440 resolution and it's very capable in 4K. it beats my 3080 TI in every way. the worst part is the pricing it should have been $899 max but we know who to blame for this!"", ""It's a 4080, you know the performance you're getting.

Rather than waiting another year or even longer for prices to come down for the top end RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 cards, why not just upgrade to the next gen while these 3080 cards are still only about $100 cheaper than a 4080?']"

It's definitely the upgrade that I wanted from my 6 year old GTX 1080 ti. However the price is ridiculous. Over $1200 for a single GPU!? That a bit much in my opinion. I had the cash at the time and needed to build a new PC immediately when I bought it, so this was the only acceptable option for me. Yeah I could've gotten one of the cheaper AMD GPUs that had better pricing, but they tend to have issues with drivers for several years from both my experience and that of my friends. So at the end of the day this was my only choice as I wasn't going spend even one penny more than what I had spent on this GPU. Which was around $1200. But enough of talking about the ridiculous prices for current gen GPUs. How's this thing perform? Pretty darn well. Games that my 1080 ti struggled to run at 1440p are running butter smooth now. Though, that's to be expected. A 6 year old GPU that can still run plenty of games pretty well will pale in comparison to the latest tech. I've even run some games with ray tracing on with decent FPS. Even better with DLSS 3. Is the ray tracing feature worth it. Not really. DLSS 3 is great and all with boosting frame rates, but ray tracing really tanks your FPS. DLSS 3 also has issues sometimes with visual artifacts from what I've heard. I haven't seen any myself. However, I only have a handful of games that support the feature, so I can't really verify how true that is. Now onto the one thing I do love about this GPU. It's quiet. My 1080 ti always made tons of noise. Probably because I didn't have the best case for cool temperatures. My current case has great airflow and this monster of a GPU has a massive heatsink that makes good use of the high airflow. The hottest I've gotten it so far is 70⁰C. And that's only for brief instances. Most of the time my temps are around 65-67⁰C when under heavy loads. Somehow it manages to stay at though temps even with the fans really ramping up. It's honestly reached the point of me not even noticing the fan noise unless I take off my gaming headset. Overall, it's a great GPU. My gripe with it is the price. Nvidia will tell you that ray tracing and DLSS are the future. Honestly though, I'm not sure about that. They're great features to have when they work and ya know, ray tracing doesn't cause framerate to tank even with DLSS. Honestly, both features feel like they're not ready to really be heavily marketed yet. The tech still has room to improve before this becomes a good selling point for any GPU. That said if you can pick this up for a cheaper price, do it. Right now, I can't recommend this product at full price. It shouldn't cost more than $1000 and even then I'd say that's still too much. $800 is about the right price for this GPU. That said, if you got money to burn, it's not a bad GPU definitely worth it if you have an old 10 series card like mine."", 'Upgraded from a RTX 3080, no issues, easy to install. Honestly I wasn’t too impressed with the performance coming from a 3080 but after over clocking I can say that I’m happy now.', 'I picked this up on prime day for a great discount. Got it for CA$1290 after taxes. For the price I paid for it, the performance has been incredible. It came packed perfectly, and came with an anti sag bracket, and a 16 pin to 3x 8 pin connector cable. The cable quality is incredible and is fairly flexible.I call this a beast not just because of its performance, but also because of its size. It’s a massive GPU and it barely fit in my NZXT H5 Flow which is mid tower case. My aio radiator is placed on the top and the Gpu had just 7mm space left in the front. When I close my side panel, it does bend the cables just a bit, but doesn’t cause any noticeably extreme cable bending. It takes up 3 slots at the back.In terms of performance, this card has handled pretty much every game I’ve thrown at it wonderfully. I play all my games on 1440p Ultra settings with everything set to max and I’ve got the best fps and quality out of it. DLSS Quality setting has been incredible.  The temperature always hovers between 51-65 deg Celsius on full load and stays at around 35-38 deg Celsius on idle.The card is also super quiet and has no coil whine at all (I’ve read a few people mention that this model has coil whine) and it runs very cool.', 'Llegó a tiempo, funciona perfectamente y está increíble :) 10/10', ""Cooling is super efficient. Card runs cool and well built. Fairly impressed coming from an EVGA card previously.The big CON however. The fans on the card are noisy. I got the card on PRIME day under MSRP, so I'm willing to live with it. (Its not as bad as I'm making it, just a tad annoying when I dont have a headset on and my system is quiet to start with)."", ""Purchased this as part of a brand new PC build after my last one hit the 10 year mark. Honestly, I didn't want to pay this much for any video card, but figured this should last me a good long while (plus the 4090s were basically out of stock for MSRP and the RX7900xtx I was thinking about were either sold out or vastly over MSRP like the 4090s).Every game I've wanted to play on 4k has played wonderfully on my 4K tv (120hz refresh), and basically maxed out whenever I'm playing on my 2k computer monitor. Super easy setup, and no overheating issues at all with it so far. Running this with an i5 13600k and Z790 motherboard with 32gb DDR5 ram. Absolutely no issues as of now.As others have pointed out: make sure your case has the room for this card. Either verify your case stats and compare to the video card size, or even take a physical measurement of the space in the case to be sure. Verify your air circulation in the case as well. And from personal experience, make sure if you're using the kickstand that it isn't impeding any of the GPU fans (luckily I caught that before anything really bad happened!).If you already have a 3080ti + card, you could probably get away with waiting for the next gen unless you have the disposable income to get a new card every generation and hope the GPU prices come down more overall. But if you're starting from essentially scratch like I was and want a higher performance 4k GPU, I would say the MSRP on this is solid for the current price environment (though if you can get the extra few hundred and find a 4090 at MSRP, may be the better bet if you need high end 4k graphics)."", ""I have to say that this product is everything its been advertised as, I don't have any real complaints other than the of course its too expensive complaint. This is a product worth paying for if you can find it for a discount. It runs anything you can throw at it with ease. I play a wide variety of Single player, and FPS games and haven't run into any issues, I play on 4K most of the time, but this card is better suited for 1440p."", ""Only had the card for a week but so far I am impressed. I never purchased a Zotac GPU, usually only purchase Asus and previously EVGA. Bought it on prime day for 1220$, which is approximately 926USD and MSRP is 1199USD. If you can get it on sale, it's a great buy. I saw comments of people saying that the card's fan are noisy, I can confirm I haven't experienced that, the card is completely silent even when under load. Build quality seems good. The card is 355mm, ensure you have clearance and proper air flow."", 'Extremely surprised by this card, the fans are well balanced and quiet and it’s very powerful. Comes with holder, power adapters and the box was very sturdy and well packed. Top quality!', ""How'd you feel if a package was sent to you that was well over 1200 dollars and Amazon just leaves it on the porch with, no care to even knock on the door?

Todo lo que he probado hasta ahora da un rendimiento excelente a 2K e incluso 4K. Instalarla fue muy sencillo. Es una de las gráficas mas pequeñas en tamaño por lo que ideal para torres mini-ITX como la mía.

But here's a spoiler....As far as gaming goes, The only way you're going to get your money's worth out of this card is if you have a high refresh rate 4k or 21:9 1440p monitor. This card is so fast that even the best CPU will bottleneck it, unless you play at 4k, and even then some games will still bottleneck the CPU. IMO, the 4090 proves these processors need to be revised for Gaming workloads.I've gotten my hands on quite a few high end cards over these last few years. So far this is the only card I've come across that doesn't need a fan curve set to keep Hot Spot temperatures in check. Sure, the power usage will spike beyond 400w but the Hot Spot temps still stay within reason. The normal GPU temps make the card look like it's at half load, when it's not. I'm not just impressed by the temps, I'm tickled. VRAM temperatures also stay within reason.Folding at Home performance is unrivaled. With Linux you can expect up to 21mil PPD and +16-20mil PPD with Windows. I thought the 3080ti, 3090, and even the 3080 were Folding monsters but the 4090 is on higher level. However, if you don't set the folding preference to Alzheimer's, then the card will fold other workloads that aren't quite as intensive, and you will get less points. Maybe the 4090 is the breakthrough Seniors need."", ""This card is the most overclocked out of the box of the 4090s.I was able to get mine to hit an average overclock of about 3000mhz without touching voltage. Memory speed I was able to increase clocks over 10 percent what it is default. That said it barely makes a difference performance wise so I am just running it at its default day to day. It boosts over 2800mhz by default.A 4000 series card is basically the only way to play Witcher 3 with all the Ray Tracing options right now. DLSS3 is required to keep it above 60fps in all parts of the game because the game is CPU limited on even the newest processors especially in cities.This thing is huge. Check dimensions against what your case allows and say good bye to 4 slots. This is really a full 4 slots. If put something in the pcie slot right below where this thing ends it would restrict airflow. Because it would be right against the thing in the slot below it.This card is really probably the only card in existence that can handle 4k and ray tracing reliably above 60fps in all existing titles. My 3090 could not even with DLSS2 in cyberpunk and it failed to be a smooth experience in witcher 3 as well though that game is probably horribly unoptimized on the ray tracing front as it was not even using the entire GPU and instead so much processing was on the CPUIf you don't game at 4k this is probably overkill. 3090 or 3090ti will not disappoint 99 percent of the time in 1440pI have talked to ebay sellers. They are getting cards directly from MSI distributors. I asked if they could sell the card with the original receipt and they said they couldn't because they got them direct.Quite fishy. I imagine many of these price gouged cards are the same thing.Performance per dollar this card is worth it at MSRP. Its a bad value at these gouged prices but if you're fine with that this card does not disappoint. Finally true 4k ray tracing gaming is possible."", 'When I was upgrading my RTX 3080 to the RTX 4090, I did the research and this card came out on top. I was blown away in DCS World, maxed everything out. it was like playing that game for the first time. The cons for me was price and it big. But that small stuff after using it, WOW is all I can say. I had to take my EGPU apart and run it out in the open. Going to add it to a Micro ATX case soon. Even running this RTX 4090 out in the open and Thunderbolt cable, connected to my Gaming Laptop. It totally rocks. They say you only get 80% performance with the USB Thunderbolt cable, May be true but I am not complaining.', 'Tenia miedo de comprarla por todo lo que se habla de la serie 4000. Pero no me decepciono y va increibleOtra cosa que temia que pasara es que fuera ruidosa pero al menos mi tarjeta no tiene problema de coil whine o que haga algun ruido extraño. Como lo comentan con la 4090 msi x trioNo se sobrecalienta aun trabajando en diseño 3D y renderizado. Y jugando en ultraEl unico inconveniente es que es algo grande y yo utilizando un gabinete corsair 4000D si cabe. Pero con los cables y el nuevo adaptador que tiene hace que no pueda ponerle la tapa de vidrio lateral. A no ser que se le compre el adaptador de cable a 90 (grados) con eso creo que serviría. Asi que podrías pensar un el adaptador o un gabinete mas grandePero aun no me animo a probar esos adaptadores, que hasta donde yo se no son oficiales.

But the shortage of the stock forced me to purchase the best I could when I decided to buy a new GPU.  I must say It was a nice surprise.  The card is built like a tank, it's quiet, runs cold, and looks beautiful.  Alluminum backplate and details don't look cheap and they are sober. In comparison the Strix looks so colorful which I don't really like.  The only problem about this GPU is the pigtail cable included (same one with any other 4090).  I didn't want to use it and had to find something better that made me feel secure.  If you're on the same boat and are thinking about Cablemod, please do not buy straight from their website or you probably will have to wait over one month for a cable that is also available from Amazon.  And yes the 16-pin to Triple 8-pin it's enough to power this card and you can have it in less than one week.  Just make shure you order the right one for your PSU.""]"

AMDs kleinen 6000ern zum ähnlichen Preis.Der Verbrauch ist gut und nur halb so groß, wie bei meiner alten GTX 1080Ti. Die Lautstärke gerade noch okay, aber verbesserungswürdig - hierfür wären teuerer Customdesigns wohl leiser - bei Preisen mglw. weit über 300€ oder gar 400€.Bei den Temperaturen kann man eigentlich nicht meckern. Unter Furmark bleibt meine PNY GTX 3060 im leise aber stark belüfteten Gehäuse bei soliden 73°C, im Spielen kommt die RTX 3060 nie über 65°C bei gemäßigter Lautstärke. Das liegt wohl auch an dem relativ großen Kühlkörper für das mickrig kleine PCP der Karte an sich und dem ""Durchblasen"" des hinteren Endes.Fazit: Gute Grafikkarte zum gerade noch fairen Preis...

Sono rimasto immediatamente colpito dalle sue prestazioni e non potrei essere più soddisfatto dell'acquisto.Innanzitutto, devo menzionare le prestazioni eccezionali di questa scheda grafica. La potenza di elaborazione e la capacità di gestire carichi di lavoro intensivi sono davvero impressionanti. Nell'utilizzo di Shapr3D per il mio lavoro di disegno 3D, ho riscontrato un notevole aumento delle prestazioni e della fluidità nel renderizzare modelli complessi. La scheda grafica gestisce facilmente la grafica avanzata e garantisce un'esperienza di disegno senza intoppi.Anche per quanto riguarda il gioco, la GTX 1630 si è dimostrata un'ottima scelta. Anche se gioco in modo saltuario a Horizon 4, la scheda grafica offre una resa grafica straordinaria. I dettagli dei paesaggi, delle auto e degli effetti speciali sono resi con grande precisione e vivacità. La fluidità di gioco è impeccabile, con frame rate stabili e una grafica di alta qualità che contribuiscono a un'esperienza coinvolgente.Un altro aspetto positivo di questa scheda grafica è il suo design efficiente dal punto di vista energetico. Nonostante le elevate prestazioni, la GTX 1630 rimane sorprendentemente silenziosa e produce un calore moderato. Questo è un vantaggio importante, soprattutto per le sessioni di lavoro o di gioco prolungate, poiché garantisce un funzionamento stabile e riduce al minimo il rischio di surriscaldamento.La compatibilità e l'installazione di questa scheda grafica sono state estremamente semplici. La scheda si è adattata perfettamente al mio sistema e l'installazione è stata facile e intuitiva. Inoltre, la presenza di diverse porte, come HDMI e DisplayPort, mi ha permesso di collegare facilmente il monitor e altri dispositivi senza alcun problema.Infine, vorrei sottolineare la qualità costruttiva e l'affidabilità di questa scheda grafica. MSI è un marchio rinomato nel settore e la GTX 1630 non fa eccezione. La scheda grafica è costruita con materiali di alta qualità che garantiscono una lunga durata nel tempo. Inoltre, l'assistenza clienti di MSI è stata pronta e disponibile nel rispondere alle mie domande e fornire supporto.In conclusione, la scheda grafica MSI GeForce GTX 1630 è un'opzione eccellente per gli artisti 3D e i giocatori occasionali. Le sue prestazioni straordinarie, la compatibilità semplice e la qualità costruttiva affidabile la rendono una scelta ideale per chi cerca un'esperienza di disegno e di gioco di alta qualità. Consiglio vivamente questa scheda grafica a chiunque cerchi un potente aggiornamento per il proprio sistema."", 'Da altre recensioni che ho letto i ""gamers"" non ne sono molto soddisfatti.

My Case is a Cooler Master Cosmos C700P Black Edition ATX Full-Tower. Pretty beefy and a heavy BEAST of a Case.Now on to my review of the LINKUP Vertical GPU Mount and PCI-E 4.0 x16 Cable...Well I have to say that I am impressed with the Linkup PCI-E 4.0 x16 Cable as I can confirm that it runs at 4.0 Speeds. I was benchmarking with 3DMark (Purchased Edition) when I discovered near the very bottom of the Page of Benchmarks, a ""PCI-E Bandwidth"" Benchmark! I was thrilled because other running than running Time Spy and other Stress Tests I still wanted to Confirm that this cable was doing it\'s job at the PCI-E 4.0 x16 Speeds. (Attached to this review are Pictures as well that show my results). So PCI-E 4.0 x16 can do up to 32 GB/s. For Comparison PCI-E 3.0 x16 can do 16 GB/s. The 3DMark PCI-E Bandwidth test averaged me at 26.30 GB/s. So as far as the Cable goes it\'s Highly Recommend from me!However the ""Heavy Duty Bracket"" sags in my case.Luckily I had rubber coated ""Thumb Screws"" that were the perfect size and I mean perfect (About 3/8"" tall) that the threaded part went through a small Vent hole in the Cooler Master Case and the part sticking up was Rubber around Metal and held up the sagging Bracket so it made my GPU perfectly straight and won\'t move due to the threads being in the tiny vent hole on the top of the PSU Shroud/Bottom of the Case. I can even add another one and use Nuts on the treads underneath to make sure they don\'t move anywhere if I move the case.I could have gone with a Shorter Length Cable (I bought the 20cm) Kit. But all in all I am happy with the results. There was another piece of metal in the box that was shown in the instructions (which are terrible) and it could be needed to prevent the issue I had with the sagging, but I can tell what it is for and I am happy with my Rubber Thumb Screws as support under the bracket.Overall Very Pleased and Would Recommend. I only gave it 4 Stars due the sagging of the Bracket, but really I would give 4.5', 'Left me enough room to just fit fans and 20mm radiator in a Lian li O11 case.

For this price you might be able to get a better one (none available soon enough for me). Unfortunately this doesn't fit the MSI Suprim Liquid X 4090 card as the metal bracket underneath where the card would go extends too far the left and interferes with the plastic part hanging down next to the connector on the GPU. Otherwise it's a solid option. Cable is solid, and the bracket should work well, assuming all your dimensions line up."", 'This works very good for my GPU and my computer. Amazing. Highly recommend.', 'First off, yes the cable is pcie Gen4 compatible with the RTX 4090. The folks that are having issues are either not plugging it in to the correct slot on their Motherboard or have a faulty wiring. That said, depending on how big your case is, it can be difficult to install. My case required me to bend the cable uncomfortably hard in order to get the screws to match up the the expansion slots for mounting. Basically pressing it towards the mobo. However it does what it’s suppose to do and it holds my RTX 4090 up without the additional support. I opted to not use that since I have fans at the bottom of my case.']"

La gráfica llegó perfectamente embalada y precintada. Es enorme. Ocupa prácticamente 4 slots de expansión. Mide 30cm de largo y pesa 2,1 Kgr. Una vez instalada no se dobla ni lo más mínimo. Eso sí: en ranuras de expansión reforzadas, que hoy en día son la mayoría en al menos el primer slot de expansión. Requiere una fuente de alimentación de 1000W como mínimo. Yo la tengo pinchada en una placa X299X AORUS MASTER que también compré en Amazon. Y funciona perfectamente. Aunque limitada a PCI-E v3.0 (la gráfica es PCI-E v4.0). Pero es suficiente. Adjunto fotos y alguna captura con pruebas de rendimiento donde pueden verse las temperaturas y el consumo. Como se peude ver, está muy bien. Y eso teniendo en cuenta los 480W de pico de consumo, no está nada mal. A modo de consejo, es mejor usar un cable de alimentación que salga directamente de la fuente de alimentación. Esta gráfica requiere un conector de alimentación de 12-pins (igual que las 3090 Founders). Lleva el nuevo conector de 16-pin, pero los 4-pin extra no se usan (en la serie 4000, sí). Por ejemplo, para mi fuente de 1200W de la firma SilversTone, el cable de alimentación adecuado para esta gráfica es el artículo de Amazon que lleva por ASIN: B092JRVKTX. Este tipo de cables sólo valen para las fuentes del mismo fabricante. También los hay para otras marcas de fuentes (Corsair, Seasonic, etc.). O en su defecto también podéis usar el adaptador 3 x 8-pin a 12-pin que se adjunta. Se ve de buena calidad y está personalizado para EVGA. Mucho mejor que el genérico de nVIDIA que tantos quebraderos de cabeza ha estado dando.Es posible poner la BIOS de la versión Ultra y ahorrarse así un dinero. Y en la mayoría de los casos funciona. Pero sólo hay 60MHz de diferencia. Y en la práctica no se nota la diferencia en juegos y otras aplicaciones. De modo que es mejor no complicarse cambiando BIOS.Lo dicho, una salvajada de gráfica. Cuesta un pastizal, sí. Pero es lo más potente de la serie 3000. Y probablemente el mejor ensamble de 3090 Ti. Sin ruido eléctrino ni ningún otro defecto digno de mención. Su único escollo es el precio. Sobre todo ahora que ya ha salido la serie 4000. Al precio al que está la EVGA 3090 Ti FTW3 Black o Ultra ya te puedes comprar una RTX 4090.', ""I bought this GPU card solely because I like EVGA brand and they usually have the best looking design for my PC builds. For the price point it's definitely not as high as it was during 2020/2021 pandemic scalp prices which were ridiculous, basically costing you your entire build. My previous GPU was a 3080 that I managed to get for MSRP before everyone started jacking up the prices and I had to settle until I could find the reason to pick this GPU up. If you didn't know, EVGA had a falling out with NVidia and will no longer be making GPUs as a partner for the foreseeable future, hence why I broke the bank and picked up this GPU.One thing I didn't verify until my product was in transit, there are two different model SKU # for the 3090Ti (Ultra/Black). There's only a slight difference in power and performance when getting the Ultra versus the Black version after researching, but knowing this is the last model I wished I would've checked. I got what I got and I'm still happy with the GPU.The third party seller on Amazon did a decent job with the packaging to ensure it was not damaged during shipping, however the GPU box itself had deep cuts into it which I didn't like if you're a collector and want to preserve what might be the last EVGA GPU for the foreseeable future for the sake of value. The seals appear to be untouched and upon opening, all the accessories were sealed and all the wraps were still on the GPU. BUT, there were scratches on the GPU and I've included a picture. Not sure how that ended up like that and I can only speculate that it might've happened at the factory as I've no proof that it happened there or it wasn't new like the seller said. Because of that, and at no fault of the seller as they may not realized at the time, I didn't give it a full 5 stars. It's disappointing to pay that amount of money and it came damaged with scratches.As far as the installation, it wasn't too hard. I just followed instructions according to the included pamphlet and QR code for the included eLeash to hold up the GPU for sag (it doesn't really need it but I did it anyway for stability). If you're bothered on the eLeash looks inside your rig, you don't have to install it as the EVGA did a solid job with the card not sagging. Make sure that your power supply unit is at LEAST 850 watt minimum as this card draws up to 500 watts (not OC'd btw). I'd recommend 1000 watts just to be on the safe side for your investment as I'm not sure if EVGA will honor their warranty if not bought from a retail store directly or their online store. One thing to note, the adapter to PCIe cable has a durability limit when bending and plugging and unplugging if you ever have to take out your GPU or clean your rig. Check JayzTwoCents video on YT about it as he goes further into det.ail. The pins and plugs will wear out after 30 times of removing and inserting which sucks for longevity.As for the performance, I can't say anything less as its a beast of a card. All my games that I played runs buttery smooth. Did bench mark test for Read Dead 2 and Cyberpunk 2077 on maxed Ultra and got frames above 78 FPS. Overall, I really like the GPU and it will be my card for the next 3-5 years. If you had eye on this card and have the money, I'd pick this card up. Those newer 40 series card doesn't look as good and are beef cakes which may not fit in you current case.

Box came with only the card, no manual or warranty card.', ""The RX 6600xt family of gpus have, over the course of this year 2022, hit a price point that makes them the best value that you can buy. The 6650xt here in particular, is the best value as it can often be found near the same price as the base 6600xt. It's just a straight up good purchase just like we used to get prior to the pandemic and supply lines being messed up.I won't bore you with the details, I will just say that this gpu paired with a good cpu, at least something like the Ryzen 5600 or a i5 12400 Intel cpu, is a monster at 1080p. It runs every game at 1080p Ultra at well above 60 fps, even new games like Gotham Knights and Calisto Protocol. Pretty exciting, given the price.If I had to give one gripe, a single con, it is that I don't know for how long this gpu will be viable. The issue with any midrange gpu right now, is that we don't know how well they will run games coming out over the next couple years. It's possible this gpu does extremely well. It's also possible it becomes a 1080p60 medium settings gpu.

Going from an over clocked 1600AF and RX 580 8GB there's an impressive performance gain at 1080p ultra. The cooler on this one is shorter than my old 580 by a couple of inches and it runs much hotter even with a very aggressive fan curve.  I have a very well ventilated case and the contact temps routinely hit 80 to 84 degrees C when the ambient room temps are 74F.  If you don't have a case with a mesh front and ample fans, I'd look at better cooled cards than this one.  There's also the noise element if you can't tolerate hearing loud fans.  I'm not particularly insistent that my computer run quietly so that doesn't particularly bother me.  I'm happy with the performance but in hindsight I'd buy a Red Devil or equivalent with more ample cooling capability."", 'Good value for money.', ""I'm actually using this for a CAD workstation instead of gaming.

Even in Star Citizen I'm getting 70 FPS which is a game of that is really graphically hungry compared to other AAA games by alot. For the price I found in my opinion only, this was way better than the 3060 or anything close to it.  The 6650 will last me many many years to come running 1080P. I have a 32 inch curved monitor.

I feel i need to do this because i\'m not just reviewing this card as a 3080, but really as a gaming tool.  I actually really am writing this cause i want to help. this is a lot of money and i really have a lot of concerns after trying this.- its\' hot, the memory is especially hot you can undervolt and do all this stuff to fix it. but kind of lame for the cost. I mean fine i\'m a cs major i can do it, but it \'s a hassle and it\'s  a compromise on a high end card that costs a ton of money.The card:I\'m going to be honest here. compared to a 1080ti (i had paid 400 for this) or rx 480 (200) yeah sure it\'s faster it\'s not that big of a deal. Most games are written for consoles.Let me give you the 1080 ti as an example cyberpunk. 2k monitor 60hz.  You will be hard pressed to tell the difference. With fsr you can utterly max out this game and on my 1080ti. On the 1080 ti i\'m getting 75f  (23 c)temps to maybe 119f , yes F!!!. I put in the 3080 the card is running at 80c. I mean freaking insane. that\'s c vs f there. Not a mistake. Granted the 1080ti is an evga, and this is a ""cheaper"" msi card, but the evga 1080 ti cost me 400 new years ago. now with FSR and soon fsr2 i dont\' see the point. I though ray tracing would be cool. to me it\'s not. Actually i dont\' care at all. It doesn\'t make much difference to the game ok for me none. So here we go why is this a remotely compelling product. It doesn\'t really do anything new, it\'s runs way too hot, and it\'s at the EOL with nvidia\'s business model. They\'ll jsut stop supporting it. I think this is a very fair comparison. It\'s a card for 5 years ago that was half the cost new, and a level up and competes very favorably in a lot of ways. -- This 3080 thing is huge too costly, and overly marked up even after mining. I mean it\'s hot as hell. You can undervolt and do all this crap to fix it, but man why am i doing that? It sounds like a jet. I\'m using a half x 932 advanced case with insane level of fans. W/o tweaks i\'m getting 80c + here.AMD Vs Nvidia.AMd is now supporting nvidia hardware better than nvidia fsr /fsr2. Think about this. Now i finally get it for me this really comes back to raytracing. it\'s pretty pointless. I used to use brick and mortar stores to try stuff. Note i LOVE amazon. they are great, but i\'d have loved to had seen this card before i bought it. You really cant\' tell form youtube. I dont\' see anything compelling here for the money. I waited 2 years to pay 800 for a overly hot video card. I mean sure if this were  5-600 it might be ok. but 800 why? OK maybe you are a 4k gamer and want 120 hz refresh. this might be for you. I don\'t\' see that taking off any time soon with these prices. Look 1060 is still the biggest card on steam for a reason. These are the smart folks if you ask me. i would just get an amd card where they put all the performance toward rasterization, or wait for cards to continue to fall back in prices to where they should be, or get a consoles. there are a ton of options that seem better to me personally. I\'m not even anti nvidia, i think amd cards are too costly too. I just think these are even more too costly. Xbox hands down is better deal until these guys adust.Power usage is really high already. I mean the 1080 ti is silent no heat and my computer works much better. and yes i have an very high airflow case with a side panel. Same case same spot my 1080ti is running 90f (Ferinheight)  vs the 3080 at 86 c (i was hitting).  are you kidding me. I wonder what would happen if i just overclocked my 1080ti to the point it got that hot if there would even be a difference.Vs consoles:here\'s the reality. i can get a series x right now on the msft store it\'s easy probably even on amazon. completely cant\' tell the difference sure on paper this is faster, but i\'ve been down this road before. They optimize the console it close the gap at least a tier higher like 3070 level. I mean that why this card was suppose to be 600 in the first place. It\'s always been about flexibility on pc, yes i like mods, i like the online experience it\'s great, i like a little extra effects, but seriously i can get a console for  half this price easy, and the deal is with the optimizations on that hardware, and trust me it\'s no joke, it\'s very close. People talk about tflops and such. Sure it\'s a little better 1/3 pretty close toa  6700xt actually, but in reality when you have the memory so close to the gpu and cpu and all the crazy optimizations it\'s close to a 3070 minimum over time. It\'s the truth. Games are cheaper on xbox too you can get used. it\'s just a better experience in a lot of ways. Yeah i wanted to pc game but these companies are so out of touch. They aren\'t living up to the expectations. Mining is really stupid,  just in so many ways, but but where ti\'s impacted me is the gpu greed has run these prices up to insane levels. For nothing. This was such a let down. I\'ll take xbox over this at these prices even still. I\'d really have to think if it was 600.  wtih my xbox i\'m getting a 3700 cpu, 6700xt gpu and 16gb of ddr6 ram totally focused to gaming, and full attention of devs. This card really should be 500 at this point. They have a ton of supply, it\'s on a cheap node, and it\'s a hassle because the cooling and power draw sucks.This card was suppose to be 600 2 years ago, it\'s 800 now. I \'m just honestly not satisfied. Go ahead and buy it, but i\'m telling you i was disappointed but hey that\'s me.These costs are out of control. Compared to the series x i really dont\' think ti\'s all that much better in say cyberpunk wither 3 or any of the games i play. In fact other than load times i dont\' think anyone is too worried about cutting edge hardware after 2 years of nobody being able to get it other than for generating fake money.This is my opinion,Ray tracing is insanely overblown. I saw flashes of light. who cares?Nvidia stuff in general: with fsr /fsr2 coming i\'m able to get pretty great performance out of much cheaper hardware i don\'t need dlss. makes me really question nvidia. i think i\'m switching to amd they support old stuff better, and finally their drivers are good anyway now. Yes they sucked before which is why i had left the rx 480 in 1017 for the 1080ti evga for 400 new.This card specifically: This thing is huge too costly, and overly marked up even after mining.  These should be like 600 at best. I say screw tsmc too. Raising prices I\'d rather just have a cheaper node with new features and slightly less fast. These guys just don\'t\' get it. I mean it\'s hot as hell. You can undervolt and do all this crap to fix it, but man why am i doing that? It sounds like a jet.PC gaming Don\'t\' know guys i\'m really starting to question pc gaming. It was always more but even after mining these prices aren\'t adjusting  fast enough for me. I think i\'m going to skip next generation too see if  it\'s just me. IF it is  i\'ll stick with consoles or go do something else. If their market share starts to shrink then maybe i\'ll consider it. This chip shortage stuff has been going on for several years now.  Right it\'s nto just gaming. but hey Sony and Microsoft  aren\'t stupid enough to pay these prices so why should i be. Eventually they have to fix this. Cause other things like computers for work need this stuff too.  Maybe it takes a couple more years, possibly not buying this will motivate them, or maybe it won\'t. The way i see this is total profit = sales * profit. I think think there is an over emphasis on profit and not on sales number go look at the steam hardware survey.Ultimately i didn\'t have any more fun on this than i did on my pascal card. I think i\'m going to jump ship on nvidia and switch to amd next, and or sit on my console another generation and re assess if and when prices come down. Pc gaming has just gotten too  expensive, too hot, and too much dramma. I ultimately didn\'t have much fun dealing with all this, and really just fretted about the money and temps, voltage etc. With my console, or older card i just enjoyed it. Nvidia and really to some extent amd, and these manufactures or whatever we call them have removed all the fun from pc gaming for me. It\'s horrible taste in my mouth and i really hated this product when i factored in the cost. Form what i\'m hearing of the new ones they are just getting hotter and need like a kilowatt. hell i\'d take a 4060-70 for a few  hundred if we can do that. It\'s probably close to this. So i say whats the rush here. Console is the play at  this point in time.IN conclusion if i\'m a game developer will i write games for 800 dollar gpus, of course not, and it shows. I mean your lucky to get support for a 400 gpu. yeah it used to be premium you can get more smoke and cool effects for a couple hundred, which is why i have the 1080ti, id\' bite but this is 2x the cost vs the xbox, and it\'s not 2x better. It\'s like 10% better MAX. The only way you\'ll ever see the features of this card full utilized is if nvidia goes in and writes all the games or you really desire super high frame rate. I guess i just dont\' care.here\'s the fix: sell this card for 500. that would be worth it and actually have some value. Just stay on the cheaper node, and optimize power usage by adding more chip l2 /l3 cache, and using slower ram. Forget about this insanley trillion dollar fab cutting edge stuff.  That\'s a product i\'d actually like to buy. the more i hear the less excited i am for the future. I think after using this that\'s the product i\'m looking for. I make good money, i like gaming but i\'d also like to retire someday. Is this too much to ask?', ""J'ai eu mon GPU pour environ 2000$ CAD, c'était très cher. Mais la carte est un monstre et tout mes jeux roulent au maximum (ou presque) sur un écran 1440p ultrawide en 240hz. Je le recommande si le prix est bon!"", ""I bought this card semi-skeptical because it's an LHR but I found it doesn't matter much. This GPU burns through any game I through at it. People have also said it runs pretty hot but my temps haven't gotten above 80 at all. As you can see though I have plenty of airflow as well. For a reference one of the games I play is Battlefield 5. I used to play ultra settings at 2k resolutions with my RTX 2080 and would sit around 60-80 fps which is still pretty respectable. But now I am running at 120-144 fps with this GPU. So this is a massive increase as you can tell. I also played Diablo 2 Resurrected for comparing and it went from 70-90 fps on max graphics as well up to 220+. Anyways it's a really great card so far and I bought it for a very fair price.

My first card, the Zotac RTX 3080 Trinity 12G, is incredibly compact and performs smoothly; it has a tasteful design that packs just enough LEDs.  My second 3000 series card, the MSI RTX 3080 12G, is a rather bland card.  It forces BIOS reset during installation with the x570 Taichi board that is paired with an AMD 3950x CPU.  Everything sounds easy, but removing the BIOS battery from this particular board is difficult after all attempts to reset BIOS have failed.  Also, they certainly make the MSI (and the EVGA) card as bland as it comes.  The MSI card simply would not post out of the box with the AMD CPU although the card is a solid performer after updates.  I appreciate that the MSI kit comes with an anti-tilt/horizontal support.  By the way, these cards do not  post when paired with the PCI-E 3.0 riser cables on AMD x570 motherboards (none of these work in vertical mount).  Only the Aorus z390 Pro Intel based CPU successfully posts through the Thermaltake riser cable.  To continue, the Aorus Master has the best set of features among the three cards.  It has plenty of LEDs along with a generous number of output options with generous display ports and HDMI options.  The Aorus Master also comes with a very useful a display panel and clocks at 1830 Mhz out of the box.  Due to the gigantic radiator design, thermals stay impressively low.  However, there are two important problems: 1)  This card is LARGE and takes up an additional PCI-E slot whereas other RTX 3080 cards do not, and 2)  VR performance is simply horrible in the first weeks of operation.  I purchase the card specifically to implement VR technology on my Aorus build.  However, jitters and stutters in the headset display render this card unsuitable for even simple VR titles.  When I swap out this card with the GTX 1080 Ti Xtreme, graphics normalize.  The visual display output feels as smooth as silk with the latter!The most recent NVidia game update (with a clean installation) finally fixes VR headset display problems.  The RTX 3080 has been released on the market for quite some time, and the 12G version is its latest and slightly augmented version.  Kudos to Aorus and Zotac for having exceeded the Founder's Edition and for pushing reliable performance to extreme thermal solution.  The new RTX 3080 holds promise of solid performance in this enormous segment of VR computing and of future online interactions.  After having waited for more than a year since the initial launch of the RTX 3080 and after having endured the fiasco of NVidia problematic launches, supply problems and the consumer price gouging, the transition from the GTX 1080 Ti Xtreme to the RTX 3080 12G has been frustrating.  Having tried all sorts of solutions from updating BIOS (that I do not recommend), Windows, Oculus software updates to prioritizing performance manually for Oculus Applications to running a debugging window in the background, nothing worked.  The fix for me (although may not be the solution for everyone) is to ensure the implementation of the game update through the NVidia GeForce Experience (not merely an applications and productivity update) with clean installation.  This measure was my very first solution when the card was installed, but it did not work initially.  Please do your due diligence BEFORE buying.  In this case, the newer RTX 3080 cards are still not vastly better than their predecessor in VR, but at least they have stopped giving me headaches when operating the VR headset.  And given the current market, factoring in inflation, the RTX 3080 12G card that goes between $800-1000 is a very compelling purchase not to mention the fact that any cards operating above this level for the current gaming industry constitutes an overkill and a complete waste of money.PS, With an MSRP at $799 for this 12G version, DO NOT WAIT!  Watch Youtube and pick the best cards for overclocking (OC) with the strongest mounting plate.  Best of lucks, everyone."", 'Let’s start with the good:1. Incredible performance2. Beautiful looking card3. Vibrant RGB4. The screen is funThings to be aware of:1. It’s a very large card at 319mm long and 4slots2. It is a heavy GPU. Get a brace. I need to.3. It is power hungry and needs a big PSU. I recommend 850 watts or higher.The bad is the AORUS Engine and RGB Fusion software. They are terrible. I have been going back and forth with their tech support who don’t really read messages carefully and if this card wasn’t so fantastic of a performer, I would have returned it. With that being stated, I may have to swap this card as it will not update the firmware version.So my conclusion is this: if their software was just ok/decent, I would be absolutely ecstatic. But I have had to put a lot of time into getting the RGB working and the firmware updating on a brand new clean install PC. It’s sad. I want to give it 5 stars but can’t.If you are considering this card and it is $799 or less, you probably won’t find a better performing 3080 12GB. And this one looks great. Just be mindful of the crappy software.', 'La targeta la recibi hoy mismo como tal es una bestia,pero tiene mucha incompatibilidad con el software rgb fusion,al nivel de estresarme tanto que hasta pensé en devolverla porque no me encendía el rgb pero le instale unos driver un poco más viejos y ya trabaja bien y no es posible que un producto tan caro tenga ese nivel de problema porque además se que es tremenda marca y eso no afecta el rendimiento para nada,pero es como todo la piñata tiene que venir con todos los caramelos sino no sirve,en cuanto a las temperaturas se mantiene muy fría máximo 60 grados hasta ahora jugando en 2k con todo en ultra y el rendimiento bestial, pero como dije antes el rgb hoy en día en el mundo gaming se puede considerar parte del rendimiento en un componente de pc,saludos a todos y que les sirva de experiencia', 'This card is worth the price, now for those thinking i could be a paid review, i am not. I would like to clarify that i HATE gigabyte products, but given the actual price cut i decided to give it a shot. It is a good card for gaming, performs exactly as expected. There in a guy in the comment throwing bad opinions towards this product so i will explain, this is a powerful card, it demands power with 3 pci-e cable and that means its temperature will be high therefore you need a good case with good airflow and a cool room to disipate that heat. For reference purposes i am able to play wz at ultra settings and the card will be at a steady 70°C, going down instantly after the game is closed.Best regards', ""I have had this card now for about 6 months. I haven't had a single problem with it. It has taken everything I have thrown at it and easily outperformed my expectations. Really worth the money. I don't normally spend a lot of money on things but a GPU (and CPU) are something I don't cheap out on. I'm glad I didn't. This thing is a beast. Well worth the money. If you are teetering on whether or not but you should spend the extra money on a GPU and want top of the line performance, you can't go wrong."", 'Excellent Card! Very powerful and it uses every last drop of the power limit. Using MSI Afterburner I raised the power and temp limit to maximum allowed. The card briefly spiked to 460 to 470 watts and can reach over 2100Mhz until the temperature starts to rise. It reaches about 83C while benchmarking and then the gpu clock speeds settle between 1950Mhz to just under 2000Mhz. 83C is a little hot for me but still under spec according to Nvidia.I decided to try undervolting and what a difference it made. After many hours of testing and trial and error this gpu seems to like 900mv at a rock solid 2010Mhz. After undervolting, temperatures now hover around 74C and the power draw stays under 400 watts.Very happy with this card.For all those owners who are having heat issues please try to undervolt. It helps immensely.', 'This is a nice 3080 12 gb card, but there are some caveats. For one it is huge, make sure it can fit in your case, and I recommend a support stand too. Temperatures were fine when I tested it, in the mid 70s to low 80s C, and not overly loud at maximum. The RGB is nice, but I question the utility as it is fairly subtle compared to Fan/Case RGB these days. The LCD screen is a good concept, but poor execution. It is somewhat small and could be brighter. More importantly, the software to change the display and RGB color is terrible. The only capability I could see is causing a blue screen...! I could not get it to work even after multiple different ""tricks"" I found online, and uninstalling/reinstalling drivers, and this is a very common issue apparently. It is a shame that what seems like solid hardware is crippled by ridiculous software. Ended up returning.', ""The idle temp for this card is around 45c. My previous card, under load for 4 hours, was around 55-60c.Underload, this card easily reaches 80c+.Played Path of Exile for 5 minutes and hit the highest temp I have ever seen on a GPU, 83c.The entire reason for getting this card was to mitigate noise and heat, which was a complete waste. It's loud as thunder and hotter than the devils taint.Even with all fans on full blast it just is melting the inside of my case. I literally have to take the side panel off of my case and point a house fan into my pc to prevent it from shutting down due to over heating when playing games. I don't know if I got a faulty card or what but these temps are insane.For a thousand dollars, I really expected A LOT MORE from this card. The performance is fine, but that isn't the only metric by which a card is measured.This can't be normal temperatures. There has got to be something wrong with this card. I have tried reaching out to Gigabyte/Aorus, but they do not respond to me and won't return an RMA request.EDIT - It keeps getting hotter! It is now idling at FIFTY degrees Celsius, with the fans at 45% speed. It's completely ridiculous. The only way to keep the card cool is to take my side panel off of my case and place a small house fan pointed directly at it on full blast. It simply puts out WAY too much heat, and for no reason. It's not even doing anything, my computer is completely idle.EDIT EDIT - Ok, so one of the three fans on it just doesn't spin. I will post a video of it not spinning. I believe this product is defective, as I'm fairly certain that, in fact, all fans are supposed to spin. It has been broken since day one, but I just realized what the problem was.They are refusing to refund my purchase. What a waste of a thousand bucks.Constant nvlddmkm crashes with this card. Despite using different motherboards/ssd/drivers/windows versions it still crashes the video drivers, so there's that. Since Amazon don't honor warranties I have to RMA this with the manufacturer. Big L for amazon."", ""I wanted this card particularly for the LCD display, and I definitely don't regret it. So this card performs great, I've had it for a couple months now and it's been providing me exceptional frames for 1440p gaming. I did have to update the drivers through aorus engine, horrible software btw, but it'll work for setting your GPU overclocks and undervolts.  This card is on the larger side for 3000 series cards, so get a case that will accommodate for the size. All in all, I recommend this card when the price is under $900, you'll probably have a good experiece.""]"

(otherwise it would have been a 2-3 star review) because i waited, that cable that was  detected as pcie3. is really pcie4. a driver update seems to have fixed the detection (rx6750xt, x570 motherboard) or it could be that the cable end has to be perpendicularly connected to the motherboard pcie16x (or straight out)…i modified the bracket so i could use another riser cable. it worked, it did not work, it worked after i pressed down on the riser cable connected to the motherboard to straighten it.as it turns out all of the riser cables that i have now get detected a pcie4. (and actually the lian-li cable included is the fastest… 24 gb/s… strange stuff, was cursing everything)the bracket is really nice. In a lian-li lancool III case, you can raise and lower the bracket to allow clearance below the bracket. i ended up using the lowest setting to give the cable room.I added struts to the bottom of the bracket to prevent sagging, and the rubber spacers on top to keep the . watercooling  block  level , and not stress the gpu circuit board… normally you do not have to worry about this because the waterblock has a back plate but the back plate would not fit on my gpu (not because of this bracket)only disadvantages this bracket could have is that it covers up your motherboard slots except for the bottom ones,good thing using this bracket is that it sets the GPU away from the side glass. moot point if you are water-cooling. i mention this because there are cases with vertical slots, but they place your gpu right up beside the side glass.OTOH lian-lian has a 4slot bracket… probably a better idea if you have an air cooled card.', ""Like others have said, this is super expensive given the thin metal design. It holds well enough but they don't give you any extra thumbscrews in the box. it requires you reuse the original ones to mount into the case but it needs three extra to put the card and slot cover in place. Luckily I had other pc case screws on hand to install the card. I had also upgraded some M.2 nvme cards and forgot till after I had the vertical mount in place so I had to take everything out in order to swap some m.2 on the motherboard. Don't be like me and make sure you have all your nvme installed on the motherboard you want before installing. Also, the riser cable length is fairly long for the O11 Evo case so I had to do some unique cable bending in order to avoid my two 140mm fans at the bottom of the case. Not bad but also not worth the price. I would only buy this is you plan to run a water blocked GPU and want the looks. Otherwise you will need to use some type of anti GPU sag device.

This is a productivity PC, not a gaming build, but just to be fun I still went with light-up components.  My desktop uses a 4K 32"" monitor and a full HD 24"" monitor.  The I7\'s IGP was having some issues with the 4K monitor so I decided I would have to add a card to the mix.  When I built the PC, video cards were way overpriced so I dug around in my junk box and found a GTX 750ti.  It worked, but the poor thing ran really hot.  That might have something to do with the fan on the card being dead and me finally just taking the entire cooling shroud off to allow the case airflow to cool the card.For months, I kept a lookout for price drops on the ASUS ROG STRIX cards.  I was looking for two things with those cards.  First, I wanted the fan stop capability as my ASUS Z690 PRIME motherboard can stop the case fans (5 x 140mm Cooler Master fans) when the machine is not under load and running cool.  This allows for a nearly silent PC as the CPU fan drops down to just a few hundred RPM and can\'t be heard at all.  Second, I wanted some lights to go along with the fans, CPU cooler, and RAM that is all synchronized through Armoury Crate (plus a custom app I\'ll mention later).Finally, the price on the ASUS ROG STRIX RTX 350 dropped to only $335 for a day or two.  I jumped on it.The timing did end up being interesting.  Back when I bought that original GTX 750ti, I did some cryptomining with it on the side and was able to make a few dollars (which actually turned into quite a bit more when Bitcoin went up in value) just letting the card mine at night.  I had planned on doing the same with this card.  Of course, the day I bought the card, the ETH switch to PoS happened and GPU mining became unprofitable overnight.  Oh well, I still needed a reasonable video card.The card is installed and working.  I have had a couple of issues, but neither is the fault of the video card itself so there is no drop in stars.First, my KVM doesn\'t like the card.  I have a work laptop and my desktop machine running to the previously mentioned 4K monitor through a KVM.  It works, but when the PC tells the monitor to shutoff, the monitor starts cycling with a ""no signal"" warning which didn\'t happen with the previous video card.  I know it is the KVM because if I bypass the KVM the monitor will stay in sleep mode as expected.  Trying to find a better KVM now (that doesn\'t break the bank).Second, and this is an ASUS issue but not specific to this card, is a problem with controlling the LEDs on the card.  I\'m a software developer and can\'t help but tinker.  Before I got the new card, I wrote a program that uses ASUS\'s AURI Sync API to control the lights in the computer.  The program\'s job is to watch for event signals when the monitor goes to sleep and wakes up.  When it goes to sleep, I shut off the lights.  When it wakes up, I let the lights go back to doing whatever Armoury Crate was setup to do.  This worked fine with the motherboard\'s LED headers and the RAM.  However, the video card is never detected by the API.  I can control the lighting in Armoury Crate just fine (which is why it isn\'t losing a star), but the API doesn\'t see it and when the API tells the other lights to shutoff the lights on the video card just freeze in whatever state they were in.  No help from ASUS\'s ROG forum on this, so for now I just have the lights on the card shutoff.  Disappointing, but doesn\'t keep the card from doing its job.OK, with all of that, the card is doing fine for what I need it for.  It plays videos, shows all content, and (most importantly) stays cool.  I\'m very impressed with how cool it stays.  I tried out one of the NVIDIA technology demos which run the 3D rendering up to max.  The card only climbed to 60C, and was still very quiet with its fans running.  When I\'m doing normal work (such as typing this), the temperature drops into the 40s and the fans on the card stop completely.  By that measure alone, I consider this purchase to be mission accomplished.', '', ""je ne comprend pas pourquoi il y a des carte a 2000$ quand cette carte  coute une fraction du prix, tout mes jeux roule a ultra setting graphique, cool éclairages, la carte est lourde donc prévoire un support, moi je m'en est fait un en Lego..."", 'Not the fastest in its price range but reliable and quiet workhorse.

It is also very high quality compared to many other 3050\'s.I overclocked core and memory and I still don\'t get higher than 53c when gaming, and simply cannot hear the cards fans, When finished gaming and just want to watch video\'s, etc. the card cools down so ridiculously fast and it\'s back in the lower 30\'s with fans off in a few seconds.Yes, this is an expensive 3050, so if price is your only consideration then look elsewhere, even though prices have dropped a lot lately.

No longer. It took me about 24 hours of wrestling to get this card to work. Initially, I could not get the HDMI port to recognize my 4K TV. In the nVidea firmware documentation, they admit that this is a problem. And also admit that ""overscanning"" of the HDMI port is both routine and also ""a problem."" There is no written documentation provided with the card [outside of a visual indicator of parts]. When I could not get the HDMI to recognize the monitor, I tried the Asus ""chatline,"" where I was asked such questions as ""What are the inputs to your motherboard?"" Huh? Power? OS? Keyboard/mice? Ethernet? This proved utterly useless. Unlike many devices with an HDMI output, after much experimentation I discovered that this card absolutely refuses to recognize ANY HDMI port which is not HDMI-Arc-1. Does anyone at the factory know that? No. Is this requirement listed or printed ANYWHERE? No. Secret. Even though they admit, in the bowels of their firmware instructions, that connections to an HDMI of an HD TV cam be a ""problem,"" they nowhere state that the HDMI-Arc-1 port of the TV is the ONLY port which will be recognized by the card. Secret. My Dell laptop does quite well on my HDMI3 port. Not here. Secondly, while it says that two images can be sent out simultaneously, this is only sorta true. The impression is that the SAME image will be sent to both. I have been unable to verify that. The VGA will transmit your Desktop. But the HDMI port will give a grossly overscanned image of ""something,"" but nothing actually useful. However, one needs the VGA to navigate the menus to set the HDMI port settings since the HDMI output is initially useless. However, after hours and hours of messing around, finally a screen with large green arrows in the corners appeared in the HDMI monitor. When you are there, you can adjust the overscan and everything seems to be over after that. Asus/nVidea: Please have this overscan arrows screen popup IMMEDIATELY on the HDMI port. It is impossible to set the HDMI port without the VGA monitor for navigation. This should be completely unnecessary. This card is used on an HP 6000 with 16G of ram and fits the ""X16PCEXP"" slot perfectly. The System says that 10G of this ram is used for ""video,"" so I have 12G of video ram. Colors are better and images sharper than with the Dell output. Most importantly, even with VPN On, I was unable to force any ""buffering"" while watching YT\'s ""4K"" video series. The card is like a magic carpet in that respect. For No Documentation, not telling anyone about the mandatory Arc-1 port requirements, and not having a sensible setup, I take away 1*. Wish I had those 24 hours of waste back.ADDENDUM: This product is extremely sensitive and needs a fresh 18GB/sec. or higher HDMI cable to operate properly - it most likely will appear ""dead"" otherwise. When booting up, if it cannot initially  ""handshake"" with the receiving device  properly, then the Output is shut off and is difficult to re-initiate. I had used an ordinary HDMI cable and found that even when I got it working properly, if I rebooted, the card would often not initiate properly and it would appear that the card was ""dead."" Tried an auto HDMI switcher, and could not get it to work, since the native output of this card is 4096x2160x60Hz and apparently beyond the capabilities of the auto switcher. Had to go back to my Monoprice manual switcher [no longer available]. With a new 18GB/sec or higher HDMI cable, the card should work reliably every time.

Originally I wanted a quick, cheap replacement and nearly settled on a GTX 1660.  I'm so glad I didn't.  I happened to find this at a bit cheaper price with a better delivery time and after comparing specs to a few other cards, I decided to roll the dice.  To put it plainly?  It was an incredible roll.

As with all GPU's, I'm not sure how future proof it'll be.  But for the time being?  It's gonna get you everywhere you wanna go as long as you're not wanting to go the ray tracing route.  You really take some decent-to-large hits even at medium on most ray-tracing settings within the games that support the feature.  But for me?  It's not a make-or-break feature.  To each their own.At the end of the day, if you have some spending money or don't mind torturing your wallet a bit, this is a near-perfect upgrade.

NO, not my equipment.4 Was NOT able to seat card completely in the PCIe slot but was able to screw in card to pc case to hold inplace, OK. Card boots up slowly flipping displays between the two monitors and goes to windows OK now5 Slow bad graphics in simple games like Start Craft2. 21 FPS unplayable. Ran the ASUS expert software and that seem to have fix the problem now. Getting 82 FPS in Star Craft with all setting on Extreme settings now. Card runs at 58 degrees to no higher than 60 degrees.I bought this card because the older 1070 Nvidia was having problems keeping up with games and RTX was just not there.  Intel 10900, 64GB RAM,  1TB 970 Evo Plus, ASUS x299 board. Should be able to play any game I want to play.

The Gigabyte software is garbage , but it has to be used if you want the custom images on the LCD panel.I had to remove all other RGB software and all graphics drivers before I could even get the software to work .I would give 4 stars if I didn't immediately have thermal issues and hassle of the software required."", 'Me salía casi lo mismo que otros modelos 3070 sumándole el coste de importación bajo que tenía en su momento.Llegó con la caja algo dañada en las esquinas pero supongo que es culpa de aduana.De todas formas me extrañó que no trajera los típicos plásticos alrededor, sólo tenía uno en la pantalla.Simplemente es una hermosura de tarjeta, silenciosa, con temperaturas bajo los 65°, 0 problemas, el software de control de rgb a mi sorpresa funciona bien.

Just as an fyi, not docking the product because this comes down to researching it well enough before purchase (that why it may be a bit cheaper then other versions of this card), but this version does not come with a back-plate. This does not seem to be a problem with cooling so far (even when running cyberpunk ray-traced on high settings it doesn't break 67 Celsius).

Ich wollte meine bisherige Aorus RTX2060 Xtreme vom gleichen Hersteller noch mal upgraden, da ich mir kürzlich einen WQHD-Monitor zugelegt habe. Dafür soll die 3060Ti hervorragend geeignet sein. Habe erst überlegt, ob ich mir eine 3060 zulegen sollte, da die ja billiger ist und 12 GB Speicher hat, aber aufgrund diverser Tests und nach genauem Vergleich mich doch für die TI-Version mit 8GB entschieden.Deren Leistung ist bekanntlich auf 2080 Super Niveau. Was sich auch in den Benchmarktests zeigt, die ich gemacht habe.---Material/Verarbeitung/Design ---:Wer die Aorus-Serie kennt, dem muss ich nichts mehr sagen. Der Aufpreis lohnt sich. Hervorragender und leiser Kühler, Metall-Rückplatte und im Falle der 3060Ti Elite ein schlichtes, aber dennoch gelungenes Design. Die Verarbeitung ist hervorragend.Das Neon-Punk-Design fällt natürlich in erster Linie durch die Anordnung der LEDs im inneren des Lüfters auf, die einen ziemlichen geilen Kontrast zu dem Schwarz / Gun-Metall vom Rest der  Karte bieten.Die Karte verfügt über einen Schalter zum Umschalten von Bios-Versionen . Hier kann man zwischen OverClock und Silent-Bios wählen. Sollte ja selbsterklärend sein.--- Software ---:Für die Karte läßt sich natürlich der bekannte Nvidia-Treiber mit Geforce-Experience verwenden. Letzeres unterstützt diverse Spiele und bietet eine gute Einstellungsgrundlage.Von Gigabyte selbst gibt es die Aorus-Engine. Die bietet automatische und manuelle Übertaktungsmöglichkeiten und sonstige Einstellungen. Vorgenommene und für gut befundene Einstellungen lassen sich in Profilen speichern. Des weiteren kann man hier den Lüfter einstellen. Also zwischen semi-Passiv und Aktive-Fan wählen.Und es gibt eine Monitoring-Funktion. Hier lassen sich die Sensoren der Karte überwachen. Also z.B. GPU-Clock, MEMORY-Clock und GPU-Temperatur und noch einige mehr. Das ganze läßt sich auch in einer Datei loggen.  Natürlich bietet Gigabyte auch eine Software zur Einstellung der Leuchteffekte an.--- Leuchteffekte ---:Sehen ziemlich gut aus, weil nicht so überladen und in den Lüftern integriert. Die Software hat diverse Voreinstellungen und erlaubt die Farben und Wechselgewschindigkeiten etc. manuelleinzustellen. Ich habe mich für die ""intelligent""-Variante entschieden. Hierbei wird die Temperatur überwacht und je nach Temperaturbereich in dem die GPU sich befindet, leuchten die LEDs in einer bestimmten Farbe. Also grün für unter 40°C , gelb von 41-70°C und darüber dann orange. Die Software ist hier mehr oder weniger selbsterklärend und intuitiv bedienbar.--- Leistung ---:Die ist auch jeden Fall mal für die meisten Games in WQHD (also 2.560 x 1.440 ) ausreichend :) Ich stelle mal die Benchmarkergebnisse mit ein. Die Leistung ist tatsächlich so hoch wie die eine RTX2080 Super. Wer sich mit Nvidia auskennt, weiß, das es sich hier um eins der Topmodelle der letzten Generation handelt. Deren Einführungspreis lag übrigens leider auch unter dem Preis den die 3060Ti jetzt hat ;) Aber die Leistung der 3060Ti ist schon recht ordentlich. Gegenüber der RTX2060 hat man ungefähr 50% mehr Leistung.  Und die Preise dürften in den nächsten Monaten noch was runtergehen.--- Lautstärke/Temperatur ---:Das war mir persönlich wichtig: Die Karte ist ziemlich leise. Im Normalbetrieb gar nicht zu hören, da die Lüfter sich komplett ausschalten, hört man beim Zocken eigentlich auch nichts. Die Lüfter/Kühler der Karte sind wirklich super. Die Temperatur kriegt man auch nach einigen Stunden Zocken wirklich schlecht über 60°C  ;)--- Nicht so cool ---:Für die Registrierung zwecks Garantieverlängerung auf immerhin 4 Jahre musst ihr echt Geduld mitbringen. Ich habe es diverse Male versucht und jedes Mal kam irgendeine Wartungsseite. Irgendwann abends hatte ich dann Glück.  Das geht besser. Und es gibt mittlerweile ein BIOS-Upgrade. Die Kompatiblität für RGB-Fusion wird verbessert. Da gibt es nur ein zip-file. Das Tool ist komplett ohne Beschreibung. Und ohne wird es nicht funktioniert. Zum Glück findet man Internet eine halbwegs vernünftige Anleitung. Auch das kann man besser machen. Dafür ziehe 1 Stern ab.Fazit:Ja. Der Euro ist nichts mehr wert ;) Diese Karten kriegt ihr leider nicht zur UVP. Und die Ampere-Generation dürfte in ein paar Monaten abgelöst werden. Hab mir die Karte trotzdem gegönnt.Weil sie mehr Leistung in WQHD hat als die 2060, die ich vorher hatte und für die  nächsten 3-4 Jahre ausreichen sollte. Und dabei nicht so ein Stromfresser (200W TDP) ist wie die Ampere-Topmodelle und die Nachfolgegeneration. Zudem ist der Kühler und das Design schon sehr überzeugend. Und natürlich als Hauptgrund: Weil ich Bock drauf hatte ;)Von mir gibt es 4 Sterne.', ""A doodle to install (plug n play really). Blindingly fast. Make sure you update all drivers to be on safe side. Have read some people don't really see the RGB around the fans as it is quiet deep-set inside the card but this is really minor details. The performance is outstanding - smooth, beautiful ray tracing output. Fans are absolutely dead quiet when on. Power attachments are 8 and 6 pin so make sure you have this available in your PSU. There is some software that you can download (RGB Fusion) so you can play around with the colours but it kept crashing on me - not sure if there was a confilct with the iCue software. Again, small details. GPU temos about 40C at idle and maybe 55-60C at full load. Overall, fantastic!"", 'Ok it’s a graphics card.  It’s astonishingly fast even at higher settings.On the downside, the designs weren’t all that clever as the power connectors are on the side , so the two chunky power cables are clearly visible.  Also, the illuminated fans are on the bottom of the card, facing down.  I’ll need a mirror in the case to be able to see any of the special fan illumination effects.Also, the card is very very heavy so be sure to buy an additional graphics card Mount, brace or leg to support the weight of the card.', 'Ottima scheda video, perfetta per gaming 1080p dettagli ultra ma utilizzabile anche per 1440p.

Für diesen Preis war es eine überwindung sie überhaupt zu kaufen.Die wichtigste Frage ist ja eigentlich ob ich zufrieden bin. =nein.Für eine RTX 3060ti hätte ich mir viel mehr vorgestellt. Meine allte Graka war die GTX 1060 von Zotac, und sie unterscheiden sich nicht extrem viel. Also man merkt kauf etwas.In Warzone, Call of Duty Black Ops Coldwar hat die Graka beinahe zu 0% Grafikkartenauslastung, was ich seltsam finde, denn ohne leistung könnte ich die ges garnicht zocken können. Finde ich sehr merkwürdig.Fazit:Ich finde die Graka seltsam und zu überteuert für die leistung die sie bringt. Da hätte ich bei meiner GTX 1060 bleiben können, oder hätte mir eine von MSI oder Asus gekauft!Nur ist mein Rückversand abgelaufen und kann sie nicht mehr zurückschicken.Nie wieder werde ich hier einen kauf tätigen!', 'La gráfica está bien pero el precio es el doble...

Rispetto a gennaio ora questa scheda si può trovare anche a 650 euro, ma è comunque un prezzo abbastanza alto per un solo componente del PC.🔵CONSIGLIO:La scheda, per poter dissipare efficacemente il calore, ha un dissipatore in alluminio molto grande e abbastanza pesante. Consiglio quindi di installare un braccetto o un supporto verticale che possa reggere la parte vicino al connettore, o con il tempo la scheda potrebbe imbarcarsi e forse danneggiarsi irrimediabilmente.

Das Spielerlebnis ist beeindruckend, und ich kann Spiele in hoher Qualität und flüssiger Geschwindigkeit genießen. Die Grafikkarte bietet fortschrittliche Funktionen und ermöglicht mir, die neuesten Spiele mit beeindruckenden Grafiken zu erleben.Allerdings gibt es ein Problem, das ich ansprechen möchte: Die Lautstärke der Grafikkarte. Während des Betriebs erzeugt sie ein deutlich vernehmbares Lüftergeräusch, das sich manchmal als störend erweisen kann. Dies kann das Gesamterlebnis beeinträchtigen, insbesondere wenn man sich auf leise oder atmosphärische Spiele konzentrieren möchte.Ich persönlich würde daher bereit sein, etwas mehr Geld auszugeben, um eine Grafikkarte von einem anderen Hersteller zu wählen, der möglicherweise eine bessere Lüftersteuerung bietet und dadurch ein leiseres Betriebsgeräusch gewährleistet.Eine Empfehlung, die ich jedoch geben kann, ist die Anpassung der Lüfterkurve in den Einstellungen der Grafikkarte. Indem man die Geschwindigkeit der Lüfter anpasst, kann man das Geräuschniveau reduzieren und eine angenehmere Spielerfahrung schaffen. Diese Anpassung erfordert jedoch etwas technisches Verständnis und Vorsicht, da sie die Temperatur der Grafikkarte beeinflussen kann.Trotz des Lärmproblems bleibt die Zotac GeForce RTX 3060 Ti eine leistungsstarke Grafikkarte, die in der Lage ist, moderne Spiele mit beeindruckender Grafikdarstellung und Geschwindigkeit zu bewältigen.

Sollend die Miner bitte auf ihre 20 Karten sitzen bleiben.Im Prinzip keine Kompromisse zb GTA 5 in wirklich allen Details und Regler auf max und echtem 4k laufen buderweisch. Bei Red Dead so ähnlich allerdings nur in Wqhd und dlss Qualität. Ich habe auch nur ein Ryzen 7 2700x zb ein 3600 ist schon deutlich besser also ich will sagen das meine CPU Limitiert. Doom Eternal alles auf Ultra Alptraum und RT Auf echten Wqhd das hatte mich am meisten beeindruckt. Lautstärke ist im grünen Bereich man hört sie aber es stört nicht. Kühlung ist gut kommt nicht über 75 grad Celsius aber man kann es im Treiber auch einstellen. Schaltet man in Treiber die Lüfter auf 100 Prozent heulend die ich bin der Meinung das man das bei Neuen Lüftern 1 oder 2 Stunden machen soll damit die sich einlaufen kann aber auch aberglaube sein . Generell gefällt mir der Treiber man braucht kein msi Afterburner mehr. Der Nvidea treiber zeigt alles an außer die Ausnutzung des RAM und VRAM. Schade eigentlich. Im Treiber lassen sich theoretisch 10 Prozent Übertackten wer es braucht. Game Ready Treiber gibt’s auch ist aber nicht nem Fall. Als echter PC Zocker verbringe ich mehr Zeit in den Einstellungen als im Spiel. Aber man kann es alles auf max stellen also von daher egal.

Yes I know that the RTX 3070 is an overkill for 1080p, 60hz refresh rate setup but I do plan to upgrade my monitor in the future. Additonally, I ran the Superposition benchmark and got a score of 24217. I also ran Heavens benchmark and got a score of 5264. Lastly, I ran SPECViewPerf test with some viewsets and got some really good results.(More details in the screenshots)*Thermals*Judging by the TDP of the card and its power requirements I was afraid that in my SG13 case the card would be toasty. But thankfully,the maximum temperature under stress is 75 degrees celsius.during normal gaming sessions I get an average temp of 65-68 degrees celsius. At idle, when I force the fans ON, the average temperature is 36 degrees celsius.All of those results were obtained at factory settings. I can't imagine what will happen when I undervolt it. The one thing that has been bugging me is that zero rpm fan mode, without the fans running at idle the temperature may reach 47 degrees and I don't think thats good for the longevity of the card. This card fullfills my requirements as I am not looking forward to any kind of overclocking"", ""Basically the title. It's worked well for me at 3440X1440, but I suspect in the coming years the VRAM will be the limit. Make it cheaper, Nvidia."", ""It's very good, solved most of my gaming issues"", ""This card is the bang for the buck right now. You should install MSI Center (that has a bunch of useful apps) and MSI Afterburner right away. In Afterburner, run the overclocking scanner, which takes about 30 minutes, and apply the results. Once it's applied you should be good to go. See attached G3D score; you'll be in for a treat! I got 26,248 (not overclocked, default voltage). Median score is 23,115 on PassMark website. I'm very pleased with this result. Games look amazing! I was thinking about getting a more expensive 3070 or a triple fan, but if your case has a good layout and you don't have an itch to OC, then just get this card.I added a picture of the card in case. Two things to note. First, my PSU is 550 watt, which is plenty for max TDP of 220 watts. Second, another reviewer said they needed a PCE cable that didn't split, but I used one that split and got the above Passmark score and GeForce Experience confirms it reaches 100% in some games.As for games, I wanted to mention Doom Eternal runs at on max settings (100+fps 1440p). Elden Ring runs at max settings (60fps 1440p) typically using only 50% of GPU. As for the new Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, I cannot run at max settings, but the fps is consistently good enough on high settings (60+fps 1440p). That game is also a CPU hog with Ray Tracing/DLSS on max distance (using 50%+ of my Ryzen 5 5600X 6-core) . The temps were building up with both the CPU and GPU running under heavy load, but it was stable and the game is beautiful!"", ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Pros:- Doom Eternal runs 70 FPS at 4k with RT and DLSS on and all settings maxed out, except for texture pool size which doesn't fit into 8gb. No impact on how cool the game looks tho! My CPU is also 10 years old and it doesn't even matter!- Small form factor, fits into tight spaces -- it's not too thick and not too wide and not too long - it's just the perfect size- Overclocks great BUT games might crash after 30 minutes of play if you overdo it, even if Unigine Heaven stress test passes.- Looks slick af. Just love holding it in my hands. No RGB stuff - some people might find it a con, but my box is always open so I don't want too much light while I'm asleep.- Inexpensive. I got it for $525 before the price went back up. I thought that is the max price I'd pay for it. Right now it's $100 extra which seems overpriced -- go for 3080 instead if you need one now.- Fans completely stop when idle, great for noise level and all.- 225W power draw at its peak, according to Afterburner. You'll need two separate cables from PSU (not one that splits!). This isn't too bad: a 3080 is probably 50% more power hungry.- Overall, great experience owning this card. No coil whine. Most games work great at 4k (with DLSS).Cons:- Fans spin at ~90% during active gaming. But if you push them to 95%+, some weird noise appears (See video)"", ""Been waiting forever for the scalping to stop and costs to go back down to MSRP. Now is the time. I was so excited by EVGAs stock that I got one, only to realize the card is nearly a foot long. In order for that to fit in my current rig I would've had to get a new case, and new RAM so I could top-mount my AIO cooling. Would've made the whole thing a 1000 venture. Somehow, MSI wins again. My old 1070 was also a 2 fan MSI and that thing was rock solid, able to play newer games even at high settings. I'm keeping it around just in case. Anyways, I was elated to find this 2 fan 3070 that was somehow shorter (but thicker) than my 1070. It can run a bit hot in my rig, hitting 84-86. OK, but not where I'm comfortable with it for long gaming sessions. EZ fix: use MSI afterburner and set the priority to temp rather than power and it will keep it to your setting without issue. Even at a lower temp it still clocks itself higher than your standard 3070."", ""Very powerful gpu despite relatively small cooler.  GPU with the cooler is not that heavy and I don't notice sag.  Temperatures get as high as 85C if I don't adjust the fan curve.  When I set the fan speed to 90% it never goes above 70C under heavy load.  The fans are also not that loud surprisingly.A con I would say is that the fan blades look very cheap and flimsy.  It does the job but I can't help think that a blade or 2 might break off.I know these gpus should be cheaper by now since next gen are coming.  But economic problems and Nvidia protecting profit complicate price drops.  It's amongst the cheapest 3070 but performs quite well.Must be used in a well ventilated case since it doesn't push air out."", ""I was so skeptical even after purchasing. The new gpu arrived today and is an upgrade from my gtx 1660 super, and my God...what an upgrade! I'm running warzone and black ops on max settings with literally zero issues.  Black Ops was for sure the hardest test. Warzone would run decent on my gtx 1660 if I kept the in-game graphic settings just right but literally nothing I did could fix black ops after two patches ago. My game looked like ***t, and there was no fixing it. I installed the MSI RTX 3070, booted it up, maxed out settings, checked gpu temp, and everything is smooth as it can be. Low temp, high performance, and insane visuals! Buy it! Don't shop around. Buy THIS card!"", ""Always a fan of NVIDIA graphics cards.  Chose this one do to size.  Card works great with respect to grahics and fram rate.  When gaming, heat rate and then fan noise increased significantly.  If you have liquid cooling, or case space limitation, this card may be a good choice if you don't mind the noise and extra BTU's.""]"

I got a great deal on this card specifically and opted to buy it rather than go all out on a 3080/3090ti, and I have not been disappointed.Although it does lack a little in the RAM department, I hadn’t really noticed it like others have stated. The drop in frame rate was so minute that you wouldn’t really notice unless you’re specifically looking for it. It certainly hasn’t interrupted my gameplay.The card runs cool, cool enough to net me the 3DMark “Cool Under Pressure” achievement for staying below 55°c in a DirectX benchmark without any adjustment. Regular temps in RL gaming usually sits in the high 50’s to low 60’s running everything on Ultra. At idle, it usually hovers around the low 40's.I did notice that initially in my NZXT case the noise was louder than expected. However, after switching to a much larger Corsair 5000 series the noise dissipated and is much less noticeable.It does make a noise when booting up as it seems like the fan blades settle when the computer is shut off. This does go away after starting though.The only CON I have at this point is the LCD screen. It was almost one of the reasons I considered a different card as others mentioned similar issues. My card is not broken yet, but it is showing some pixel death in the form of a small pink almost invisible line which cuts my image in half (see picture). This did happen after like 2 days though, so I’m almost certain that premature death might be in the future for that little guy.This still won't be a deal breaker, as long as it’s just the screen and not the entire card making it unusable.Overall, it’s great card at a really good price, I'd watch out for future price drops now that the 4090's are releasing. I’m happy about its performance and it’s pretty cool looking.

Baldur's Gate 3 on Ultra 3440x1440 21:9 @ 100+ FPS does get the fans spinning but I couldn't hear them, and the temp never went above 60c during the 2 hours of gameplay which means the heatsinks, fans, etc. are doing a good job.

Not realizing that had me running around in circles, sending it to Gigabyte for warranty repair... I even considered returning the GPU. But, once mated to a compatible AIO and plugging in all the connectors - there's no problems, I'm drooling over the card's potential. I have seen info online that top-end cards run hot and loud, and that liquid-cooled units get better cooling (and are thus less prone to failure) than fan-cooled cards."", ""If you're spending the extra coin on water cooling a GPU especially with the shortage pricing, you want extra thermal headroom and no noise.Out of the box the water block's contact with the GPU die was poor enough to warrant immediately repasting it before putting it under load. This fixed that issue, but come on now...Far worse is the coil whine I discovered when load testing. It is absolutely insufferable. My case is modified pretty heavily to deal with fan/pump noise, but when the card is under load the coil whine is so loud I can sometimes hear it though headphones. None of the usual tricks- overclocking, undervolting, or swapping the PSU out helped. Changing the frame rate just changes the pitch of the whine- at low FPS it sounds like an ignition click and at very high FPS (e.g. on really old games) it's a high-pitched squeal. It has not gone away after a month of regular use. With a freesync panel the pitch changes with the frame rate. It gets real annoying real fast.Unfortunately I didn't get all my parts in until Amazon's return window closed on this so I didn't discover this issue timely. If I could have I would have returned it here rather than be stuck trying my luck (and my patience) with GB.This is absolutely unacceptable at any price point, but especially sucks given how expensive this thing was. At this point, it's either bite the bullet, try risky surgery, or cut my losses on fleabay and get another brand of card.With the repaste the thing performs fine, but the coil whine just ruins the mood.Oh... and just to add a little insult to injury, they included a little mascot figurine in the box.

Still couldn't resolve the issue. I checked my RAM, MOBO, NVME, plugged in another graphics card to ensure it wasn't any of the other system components.I checked Gigabyte's website. They don't even have a user manual which is ridiculous, considering you're spending nearly 2000 dollars. I tried calling their support number, they didn't answer. I would try emailing them, but I shouldn't have to wait 7 business days for a response for buying their flagship AMD card.All in all the experience was awful, Gigabyte support is unresponsive and irresponsible.

If you need your PC for any crucial tasks, I would avoid this card and get something else otherwise you'll be stuck with a 2000 dollar paper weight after the warranty expires."", ""Nice card but please do not buy if you do not already own a liquid cooling pc. Gigabyte should have mentioned that having a prebuilt liquid cooling pc is a requirement in the product details (the reason why for the 2 stars). What came with this GPU is the GPU itself, instruction manual, a thermal paste, and an Aorus figurine. Buying a decent liquid cooling kit right now would cost you somewhere between $300-$500. Unless you want to spend a few extra hundreds then don't bother with this card."", 'The card is not worth the price to performance. For no reason should there be this much markup for a waterblock and binned GPU. Your last gen top of the line binned cards at most were $300-$400 above msrp. BTW the card is not any better in my experience than the original OC potential of a regular card. I can only get +100 on the memory [I\'ve seen many stock cards getting +150 on memory which is AMD limit only thing they\'ve done is unlock the slider which does no justice] you only get +15% on the power limit slider?! Seriously?? For a ""special binned extreme card"" pathetic. Card is only good for an OC of 2600mhz which again is sub par for a ""binned chip"" considering I\'ve seen much higher out of others. In short the card is an overpriced not really binned GPU. Avoid this generation avoid supporting these prices.', 'Box showed up in perfect condition with all accessories, but there was literally just no GPU in the box. Talk about disappointment.

So that’s being returned, and I ordered this 3080ti XC3 ULTRA.Thing came in it’s OG packaging, which is great. Thing looked BRAND NEW… RGB working, and fans working. I mean it was basically like a new card, unlike that poor mined on/abused 1080ti.I plugged it up, it was significantly smaller then the 1080ti,The 1080ti would constantly crash my games.even with out vr. I did everythingHoping it wasn’t the gpu….  No one I know believed it was the gpu but it was,Because I plugged in my hp reverb g2 into the 3080 and all my games ran smooth as fkn butter. The vr had not ONE stutter not ONE issue ….. this 3080ti puts everything else I’ve had to shame. I had literally been trying to play asetto corsa on VR FOR WEEKS !!!!! The vr forced me to basically rebuild an entire pc, but now…… it’s gobbling it up lol.This seller whom ever they are, is certainly playing NO GAMES. If you’re on the fence about buying from here.

I am extremely pleased with this graphics card. However the only bad thing I would have to say of my experience is that the packaging arrived badly damaged. Thankfully the GPU was not damaged in anyway.

Very happy and absolutely would recommend amazon warehouse for an amazing deal."", 'Let\'s all be honest.  You\'re not buying a GTX 3080ti because you want to get the ""best bang for the buck.""  This card is NOT a good value; it\'s severe diminishing returns.  This is one of the most expensive cards available, and its performance shows.3D card prices have been skyrocketing ever since Web3 and crypto became a thing.  Finally prices dropped down to a bearable level, and I made the purchase for a nice upgrade from my 1080ti.This particular card seated perfectly for me, no trouble with adding the extra power cables that 3D cards require.  Card is nearly the same dimensions as the old evga gxt 1080ti, so zero space issues, either.  For smaller cases, be VERY cognizant of card dimensions, this card is a BEAST.Card at 80% use (locked 144 fps in Cyberpunk max settings at 1080 no drops? NICE) fans are still quiet through my case. I never noticed a difference.Had issues in Win10 with drivers, had to do some finicky nonsense in safe mode, uninstalling all nvidia software, and then reinstalling reference drivers.  I had serious massive FPS gains, but ymmv.All in all, very happy.  Was it worth it?  Probably not.  It\'s a 1000$ toy.

That's my recommendation for buying a graphics card these days wait for something to go on sale and buy it (anything that is more than 15% off is generally a great deal).I've been running this card for about 2 weeks now and it has been performing amazing. I have this card running with an AMD Ryzen 7 3800x 8 core processor and it handles it very well. I've been playing games like GTA and Rainbow Six Siege on max settings and it only uses about 8 GB/ 12 GB and gives me a constant 144 frames per second on my 144 hz monitor. It's normal operating temp for me is about 63° C and bumps up some when playing graphic intense games. I've seen other reviews here that said their card was running overheated but that could largely be their own fault if they don't have good air flow through the case or various other things.If you do purchase this card you can register it on EVGA's website so if it does malfunction or break within 3 years of purchasing you can ship it to them and they will fix it for you.So far so good with this graphics card, hopefully wont need to upgrade for a while now."", 'Poco mas que decir que no se sepa de esta tarjeta grafica, es simplemente magnifica.

Muy feliz con la compra, aunque tuve problemas con Amazon México debido a que perdieron mi pedido inicialmente y me hicieron realizar un engorroso proceso de devolución antes de obtener mi producto finalmente.', ""For starters, this card is a gamble. I saw the reviews demonstrating a few concerns, such as poor stock voltage calibration and the potential for absolutely massive energy draw, but I decided to take the plunge anyway.At $13 shy of $2000 shipped, this was a mistake. After a year of waiting to even find one of these in stock on amazon or any other online retailer, I thought I was about to experience 200 fps 4K gaming and whiz-bang benchmark scores to measure against everyone else's e-pen. Instead, I removed the EVGA box from the packaging and noticed the Amazon box was immaculate, but the EVGA box had a dented corner. No matter; I removed the old 1070, plugged the 3080 ti in to my Seasonic X-850 and the rest of my Ryzen system, and started the system. Desktop was reached, loaded up the freshest nvidia drivers, and finally started a game.Doom Eternal was just the game. I cranked all the settings to Ultra-nightmare, enabled RTX effects, and loaded up the Super Gore Nest.I looked EXCELLENT for about 10 minutes--at which point the game began to experience visual artifacting, such as strange interlacing-looking problems and a picture-in-picture look where the HUD showed across the entire screen, but the gameplay was confined to a tiny quarter of the screen on an otherwise black box. Flickering was rampant. My secondary HDMI monitor also cut out intermittently.I thought perhaps that the card was running too hot. Afterall, it's the smallest 3080 ti on the market without a reference cooler. All others appear to be 2.8-3-slot designs, whereas this is just shy of 2.5.Maybe I'd try an easier game to run: GTAV. Maxed out, I easily achieved 100+ fps-- for about 10 minutes. It appeared every game I tried would crash to desktop or experience severe visual artifacting. Time to reduce the voltage!I followed the steps shown on many youtube channels to reduce power draw and increase card longevity, and still no dice. HWMonitor showed powerdraws of 180-450W, fluctuating RAPIDLY during gameplay. This should NEVER be the case, and I'd attribute this for the 1-star review.After only 1 week's use, my system refused to POST. It turned off one last time, killing the motherboard, a MSI B450. All the other parts of the system, including the power supply, have been since reconstructed after a motherboard replacement and are working as they had before. The 3080 ti was tested in a second system, and when the same initial problems arose (crashing, instability), I quickly removed it. Not worth destroying a second system.So here's the kicker: the card cost almost $2000 on Amazon but only $1199 from EVGA at the time of posting. Despite much back and forth over the cost of returning, Etech makes no effort to rectify this issue and instead continues to focus on whether or not the card is defective, always dodging my questions and never addressing any of my concerns.For the last 3 weeks, I've been sitting with roughly $3.5K in parts, $1.5K of which I only got back up and running on 10-23. Now, should I RMA the card to EVGA and get a used card only worth $1199 new? Or do I return the card to Etech and have them take a $400+ cut of $2000? Quite the pickle, and I wish everyone luck on their gamble because that's what you'll get here: poor packaging, price gouging, and a guarantee to be gouged harder when it fails.Wait longer and let these poorly designed, over-marketed, power gulping, fire-breathing dragons be forgotten. I know I'll have trouble forgetting how bad this experience was and continues to be. If you want to give over $800 away, buy this card!"", 'good stuff', ""This card is a welcome upgrade from my EVGA GTX 1080. Handles MSFS22 at 4K Ultra with a visibly smooth framerate. 3DMark score of 16,800 on a Ryzen 7 5800X with 128 GB of DDR4 @ 3600. For the price it's comfortably within the standard range of performance for this hardware despite being slighly below average for the 3080 Ti chip. You will probably get better results with the FTW3 variant of this card but it will cost you a bit more. I'm happy with the price/performance of the XC3 and it smokes my GTX 1080. It does bench hot, it gets up to 86C under 3DMark bench. Hopefully this does not harm the longevity of the card. My EVGA GTX 1080 SC still works great after 5 years of moderate use so I have high hopes for my new RTX 3080 Ti XC3. I can recommend this card to the casual PC gamer. I am not an overclocker, I just want fly fake planes in 4K.""]"

Passant ainsi de 14 GO à 16 GO.☑️ Après l\'installation de cette dernière, les performances de mon PC ont tout de même augmentées tant au niveau de la vitesse et de la fluidité que de la qualité graphique et vidéo.☑️ Cette carte est parfaite pour des applications en bureautique. Par contre, pour le gaming, c\'est un peu juste il vous faudra opter pour une carte graphique offrant plus de GO, ce qui tout est à fait normal et ne remet nullement en cause la qualité et les performances de cette dernière.💡 Installation de la carte graphique :☑️ Facile et rapide, il suffit de d\'insérer la carte dans la baie PCI Express 16x de votre PC, y brancher votre écran, et voilà c\'est terminé. Celle-ci sera reconnue automatiquement lors du redémarrage de votre PC.👉 Je précise que mon équipement est un PC HP EliteDesk 800 G1 Intel G3220 et mon système d\'exploitation est Windows 10 professionnel💡 Caractéristiques de la carte GeForce GT 730 :☑️ La carte GeForce GT 730 est une carte Nvidia d’entrée de gamme. Elle fonctionne à 902 MHz en utilisation normale.☑️ Cette carte est dotée de 2 Go de mémoire DDR3 fonctionnant à 1,8 GHz.☑️ Elle transite de données sur le bus 128 bit avec une bande passante de 25,6 Gb/s.☑️ Elle est munie d’une interface PCI Express 2.0 x16 pour être insérée sur la carte mère.☑️ La carte dispose de 3 sorties vidéo : 1 VGA, 1 HDMI et 1 DVI. Cette carte peut ainsi être utilisée pour upgrader les Unités Centrales qui ne comportent qu’une sortie VGA.☑️ L’Unité Centrale upgradée peut ainsi être connectée sur les appareils nouvelle génération adoptant des connectiques d’entrée vidéo DVI ou HDMI.☑️ La GT 730 est en ""Low Profile Format"", ce qui permet de la placer sur n’importe quelles Unités Centrales présentes sur le marché.💡 Performance de la carte :☑️ Cette carte consomme une puissance TDP de 49 Watts. La puissance conseillée minimale pour le boitier d’alimentation du PC hébergeant la GT 730 est de 300 Watts.☑️ Pour la vitesse de texturation, la GT 730 transfère 11,2 GT/s.☑️ La GT 730 traite 268,8 gflops en virgule flottante.☑️ La MSI GT 730 est silencieuse car la conception du système de refroidissement a été bien pensée.☑️ Grâce au radiateur imposant posé tout le long de la carte, le GPU et la mémoire ne sont pas en surchauffe.☑️ L’ESR est de ce fait plus faible.☑️ La GT 730 fournit une résolution maximale analogique 2048 x 1536 et une résolution maximale numérique 2560 x 1600.☑️ Elle peut prendre en charge 2 écrans simultanés.☑️ Les limitations matérielles sur la GT 730 sont comblées par les différentes fonctionnalités logicielles prises en charge par la carte pour booster ses performances.☑️ La carte supporte notamment Microsoft DirectX 12,  NVIDIA 3D Vision Ready, NVIDIA Adaptive Vertical Sync, NVIDIA CUDA Technology with OpenCL support, NVIDIA FXAA Technology, NVIDIA PhysX technology, NVIDIA PureVideo HD Technology, NVIDIA TXAA Technology …☑️ La carte supporte notamment Microsoft DirectX 12. DirectX 12 permet une gestion multitâche des instructions graphiques. Avec la DirectX 11, les tâches graphiques étaient groupées sur un seul core CPU, ce qui entrainait une latence de traitement assez notable. Par contre, avec la DirectX 12, les tâches graphiques peuvent être réparties sur différents cores CPU. Ce qui rend les traitements rapides et sans à-coup.☑️ NVIDIA 3D Vision Ready permet à la carte de prendre en charge les écrans et lunettes 3D en stéréoscopique. La carte fournit de ce fait une résolution Full HD assez fluide et sans cassure pour le plus grand bonheur des amateurs de jeux 3D.☑️ Elle prend également en charge la NVIDIA Adaptive Vertical Sync. Lorsqu’elle est activée, elle permet d’éviter les saccades et les cassures d’image en sortie. On observe généralement des images saccadées quand le frame rate est assez faible et des images en cassure en FPS trop élevé. L’Adaptive Vertical Sync active ainsi la V-Sync quand le frame rate est trop élevé pour éviter les cassures d’image et le désactive en frame rate trop bas pour fournir des images non saccadées.☑️ La NVIDIA FXAA Technology assure quant à elle un temps de traitement minimal en utilisant un shader post-traitement qui analyse les images et ne traite que les zones assez différentes. C’est donc le système anti-aliasing de NVIDIA en réponse au MLAA d’AMD.☑️ Elle prend en charge également TXAA. Cette dernière permet de réduire les scintillements. Elle gère efficacement l’anti-aliasing mais consomme plus.☑️ La PhysX permet de profiter d’un moteur physique qui fournit des effets réalistes. Il permet aussi aux 96 cœurs de la GT 730 de prendre en charge certains calculs, soulageant ainsi le CPU de certaines charges.☑️ Le CPU pourra ainsi traiter d’autres tâches plus importantes. L’ensemble serait ainsi plus efficace et ne subira point de saturation. PhysX est en effet pris en charge par les cartes telles que la GT 730 ayant plus de 32 cœurs CUDA et 256 Mo de mémoire.☑️ Cette carte graphique arrive à fournir un frame rate de 47,5 FPS en 720p.  Par contre, si on augmente la résolution de sortie, la GT 730 atteint ses limites. En ultra 1080p, on obtient 3,5 FPS et en QHD le frame rate moyen obtenu est de l’ordre de 0,5 FPS. Cette carte peut donc être utilisée en résolution 720p et inférieure. Elle n’est pas conseillée pour jouer au-delà de cette résolution, car vous aurez des images moins fluides voire saccadées.💡 Conclusion :☑️ C\'est une excellente carte graphique qui en offrant de nombreuses caractéristiques de qualité a répondu bien au delà de mes attentes. Le prix de cette dernière est largement justifié par ses diverses performances et de sa large compatibilité. Elle mérite donc amplement ses 5 étoiles avec une recommandation toute particulièrement positive.👉 Pour plus de détails, j\'ai joint quelques une vidéo et quelques photos à mon commentaire , en espérant que l\'ensemble vous sera utile pour vous aider à faire votre choix. 📹📷', 'Arrived quickly and came complete with optional brackets so can be used in either a full size slot or as a side by side.

Per quello che costa rispetto alle altre in questo periodo è più che buona (550€ rispetto ai 630€+) però bisogna regolarla un po' per tenerla fresca ( ci sono tanti video su YouTube sull undervolt)."", ""Honestly, I was holding out for an EVGA card, but the sellers on Amazon weren't lowering their prices.  I chose the PNY card because it had good reviews and in the 2 weeks I've had it, it has been a great card.  Installation was normal for a GPU - couple of screws and a tab for the PCI slot.  The power connection is in a normal spot, so you shouldn't have any issues connecting the 8-pin connector from your motherboard.The fans are very quiet, and it's been able to run everything I've thrown at it without breaking a sweat.  I downloaded the Velocity X program from the PNY site for tracking temperatures, speed, etc.  This is also how you control the LEDs on the card.  You can set to various colors, however I set it to shift based on the GPU temperature and I've yet to see it run hot."", 'Excellent card overall, getting over 60fps on the games I play. I do wish that PNY came out with a single-fan variant of this card, as there isnt very many 3000-series ITX card options on the market.I ended up swapping the heatsink/fan from my 3060 to fit this 3060ti in my ITX case, since the PCB was the same size and the component layout was almost identical.', ""Since cards were hard to find at reasonable prices, this one was a bit cheaper than some others so I pulled the trigger.I was weary that it'd be louder than I'm used to with only two fans (vs 3), but after maxing out the framerate in games the fans only ramp up a little, and it's barley noticeable.I'm quite pleased, and you get a 3 year warranty with PNY as well, which isn't any better than EVGA now (which is also 3 years).My case is closed/mesh style, but if you are looking for an attractive card as well, this one really looks quite modern with clean lines and nice lighting."", 'Super easy to install in my older (from 2016) i7 4790 system (with PCIE 3.0 slot.)

(I had a 1070 ti prior and it could never fully handle 4k without scaling down to about 60-75% resolution on bigger titles from 2016+, especially without DLSS support.) The 3070 ti handles just about every title I've tried from 2020 and before at 4k with no need for DLSS or scaling, high to ultra. I would personally recommend it for 4k, but if it is priced closer to a 3080 than a 3070 i'd wait and get a 3080 for 4k. I wouldn't call playing dying light 2 with RTX on at 4k a very smooth experience with this card, but I also don't have a 3080 to compare that to. Revisiting some games at 4k on a tv brings back everything I forgot I missed from consoles, and most games have been buttery smooth. Dying light 2, and tiny tina's wonderlands have needed some tweaking down from ultra.Form FactorIt's Biiiig. I haven't had any case clearance issues with mid tower cases, but double check before you purchase. I had this in a build with a full ATX motherboard, and I was able to reach my cables around no problem (more on this later). The weight of this card introduces a little sag even while screwed into the case. While it is not drastic, in the future I would like to see an elegant solution included with heavy gpu's, be that an included riser, bracket, mount, or stand. If it's not secured and sagging at all I would recommend taking out the GPU before traveling or moving the computer. or at the very least lying the computer down to where the gpu is not being pulled down.More on Size(This is mainly if you use a micro ATX motherboard) In the past week I rebuilt into a higher airflow case and had a motherboard issue (Not Due To This Card. For transparency and maybe helping someone to avoid the issue i caused, it was my own user error mixing an ARGB up with an RGB header while connecting case RGB, therefore frying my board.) This lead to me getting a Micro ATX motherboard. The issues with a Micro ATX board pairing with this card might be mitigated with some more planning time, a different model of board, cable extensions, or in my case compromises. I couldn't use 2 out of the 4 sata ports on the board due to the card covering half of them, but these sata ports were mounted to the board vertically (popping up from the board rather than sticking out to the right) If you plan on moving your computer around often after building i'd either recommend getting a full ATX motherboard, or making sure that if it's micro ATX that the sata ports are sticking out to the side as to not stress your sata ports or squishing the cables. Front audio and usb's were also impossible to get to on the smaller motherboard as the card covered those completely. I will not take a star off for this because I knew the risks of getting a cheaper smaller board, and I don't need those ports as i'm running all audio through the hdmi and back usb.PriceIf you are torn between a 3070 a 3070ti and a 3080 (as i was) it might help to know that the 3070 ti is about 8% to 12% faster than the 3070, and the 3080 is about 15% to 20% faster than the 3070 ti. As prices varied at the time of this purchase those were the numbers I took into account. At my time of purchase (april 2022) a 3070 was 100$ cheaper, and a 3080 was $400 more expensive.PowerI would recommend 750 watts for your PSU if you have a more power hungry CPU, I tested this card on a 650 watt power supply with a 3900x and did a power scan with precisionX and it recommended I go up to 750 watts. It didn't crash or make noise on the lower wattage psu, but i do feel I was right at the limit, and I felt like I was before checking as well. Better safe than cardless.ConclusionThis is a great card. It's nice to look at with it's massive RGB bar of light. It runs cool and quiet. EVGA has a stellar track record with it's customer service, and has a long warranty. For most people buying this should be as simple as making sure the PSU can handle it, plugging it in, and getting drivers installed."", 'Funcionan perfectamente; el tiempo de entrega fue aceptable. Haré otro pedido, recomendado!', 'If you can find one of these on the used market in the future or are buying remaining stock. Dont hesitate. this thing kills. Great performance, amazing EVGA build quality, and fantasic customer support. Its a shame EVGA is out of the GPU market.', 'I am beyond impressed with the EVGA Geforce RTX 3070 Ti graphics card! The performance is truly outstanding and I am able to play all of my favorite games at 4K resolution with ease. The ray tracing capabilities are also a game-changer, providing incredibly realistic lighting and shadows. The card runs cool and quiet, even when under heavy load, which is a huge plus. The design is sleek and modern, fitting in perfectly with my build. The software is also user-friendly, making it easy to overclock and customize settings. Also, the price is a bit high and I would wait for a sale. I recommend the 3070 Ti', ""Finally had the opportunity to buy this beast of a graphics card.  While the smaller brother to the 3080 or 3090.  It has plenty of power to push your favorite games at a solid frame rate.  Additionally if you are using the GPU for video encoding, this little power house can get the job done at a a solid speed.I had upgraded from a gtx 1070 and while looking back fondly at how efficient the last card was, greatly appreciate the upgrade at prices that weren't hyper inflated due to crypto mining.Lastly and most importantly to me.  This card is one of the last EVGA manufactured graphics cards available.  EVGA is an amazing brand with outstanding build quality and design.  Having been in the graphics card game for a long time, I have found that their brand has always had the right feel for me, now that they're bowing out, this card has a bit of sentimental value on top of it's already amazing features.If you have a chance, I'd say get your hands on this outstanding piece of computer gaming history while they are still available!"", ""I love the gameplay on my 1080p setup.  Not planning to upgrade to 4k anytime soon.  Runs pretty cool with stock fans. Usually, only one fan runs unless under load.  I can use fancontrol software to adjust speed of the fans.The only downside that I have with it is I use Armory Crate to control the ARGB on my ASUS motherboard, and it doesn't recognize the RGB bar on the video card. I have to use Precision to control the card's RGB bar.  JackRGB and Signal RGB didn't sync for me either. The header on the card can control other RGB, but that header only goes out, so a incoming signal from the MB will not work, and my MB is control out also.I did try to OC it slightly about 3%, and had no issues, but tuned it back down since all three fans spun up very dramatically.Its's heavy, and sagged in my expansion slot, so I mounted it vertically in my case and bought an additional extension cable to connect it and an GPU brace support to help even with it off the mb."", ""The Nvidia Boards are the best out there so there is not much more to say about them. We build custom computers, not the drop down menu pick your wish type. The units we build are structured to the individual and their use. Anyway so we go through a lot of graphics cards.What I will say is just look carefully at your prices. We bought this at~$740, now today I looked and we could have had a 3080 upgrade from a different seller - albeit without Prime delivery - for a little less. The 3090.s that were ~$3,000 are now in the high teens, but still there is a seller looking for $6000. So bottom line this board is great buy had we waited a week we could have given our customer an upgrade for less. Amazon is still your best bet to get any board at a good price, just look carefully and search a lot of different terms as each time you'll see new listings depending upon the search terms they used when listing."", 'One thing that struck me is the size. Pictures dont do it justice to how big and heavy it is. But performance is amazing. Ive thrown every triple a game at it and it handled it amazingly.  The only game i had an issue playing was starwars battlefront 2 and ultra high settings. Where my frames dropped below 60. But even then i think it was due to my motherboard having pci 3.0 instead of 4.0 and my cpu being a mid range 5600x. Besides that no issues at all. Temps are around 100 with just fan cooling. Highest ive ever seen it go was 140 in a hot room with no ac and even then if i use msi afterburner and turn fans up to 100% the temps drop 40 degrees and still the card has no frame drop ot throttle. Absolutely beast considering its like the top 3 on the market right now for nivdia. (Before 4000 series comes out). Highly recommend  if you can find it at a low price.', 'I tell you what, This card is a beast!! When I purchased, it was a pretty decent price and good value. No complaints at all except if the PC with this card is in a small room, it will be hot in that room… This card will absolutely heat things up without a doubt..', 'This card is everything that it should be, that being said, the only downside was the price. All of these cards, especially Any type of EVGA especially the FTW3 is gonna be scalped (bought at retail and sold at a higher price). I got this for about $850 which is higher than retail, but at the time of purchase was way better than the ones I saw upward of $1000 to $1100. The card came shipped in perfect condition, new as advertised all sealing packaging intact. Popped it into my PC replacing my old card and installing the new drivers (I previously had an AMD Card), I was gaming in no time. I understand the price should be less, but overall aside from that, would recommend!']"

There was a very strong acrid smell (flux) – although not necessarily something to be concerned about. I looked over the board and couldn’t find any obvious repairs or glaringly poor solder points. I didn’t pop the fan, but I was able to see reasonably well enough through the side to see the BGA pad. Likely just packaged factory smell.Anyway, I was happy.The only thing to note was the fan post connector wasn’t seated properly. But that is meaningless.It’s an easy swap of course. My guess is anyone using one of these has a general idea of doing that anyway.Based on a tiny bit of research, I was expecting 2K out of the DVI, but a max of 1080p from the HDMI. I’m using HDMI on the primary monitor and DVI on the secondary (logistical reasons)In XP I’m getting 2K from the HDMI but only 1080p on Windows 7. The drivers that came with the device appear to be the latest, but I also downloaded them from ATI (AMD).I DID have a couple of issues during the install of the driver – it wasn’t finding the Ati2mtag.sys file (held as ati2mtag.sy_ in the bundle). This is an ATI installer issue. Extract the drivers to a local directory, wait for the error and duplicate the file it can’t find to the same directory with the proper extension (you can simply rename it – old habit in case there are two calls for the same file in the routine – rare, but happens)It also seems I’m having issues with the Catalyst Control Panel in Windows 7 x64, but not in XP x86. I’m sure I’ll figure that one out, but a complete removal of everything so far isn’t working. Perhaps there is some debris in the registry. That said, it is working perfectly fine per my needs at this time.The quality on the monitors is excellent – for the level of card. Unlike the Radeon I was using in this old box before the text is clean at all the resolutions I tried.While I don’t use these boxes for gaming, I did load an old game in XP, installed nGlide – and was very happy with the results. (at least after finding a recently dated C++ redistributable was being a bit of a pain – I removed them all and reinstalled 8.0 and 10.0 only. No application I’m using  had issues with that.)Overall I’m very satisfied with the card. It isn’t the most current, so you may have instant success or have to mess about a bit.The minor issues I had were ALL Driver related. That is an ATI issue, not the manufacturer of the card (in this case). Whenever you’re using legacy hardware you can encounter challenges that have nothing to do with the hardware itself, but rather interaction with other hardware – and more often Driver compatibility (for example, using an old OS and expecting the latest C++ redistributable – made LONG after the OS was retired – not to create any issues. It shouldn’t shock you if it does) I would buy and recommend this without hesitation.Only 3 Stars for Gaming because it is not capable of the latest titles, but more than adequate for what was available when the chip was first releasedThe run time so far has only been about 20 hours (I was hoping to do more before this review, but alas my time was constrained.)', ""Plug and play on Windows 10, with a Intel 9800KF cpu. This is for a freeNAS server. This intel CPU does not have onboard graphics. This low low end graphics is just enough.This card is from 2011. This is OLD. Hidden stock, lost stock who knows.However, it has DVI and HDMI for debugging the NAS. And its all I need. I wish I didn't need it, but the CPU doesn't have onboard graphics, so whatever.I like how it does not require power from the PSU, keeping my build low and clean.""]"

The only games to use ray tracing well are cyberpunk 2077 and watchdogs 2. Idk it\'s whatever.Temps never go above 73c no matter what I play, or even running benchmarks while using the OC bios and default fan profile with the latest drivers.No crashes, bsod, or compatibility issues what so ever. AMD drivers have come a very long way.GPU core clock is usually around 2500mhz and VRAM is insanely fast at times reaching the same 2500mhz. Default fan profile is pretty quiet and not irritating at all, it can get up to around 2000rpm on the fans which is very audible especially since using a semi open case, if this was in an enclosed case would guess that it would be near inaudible. No coil whine on my unit (thank the hardware gods), power draw has reached up to 320 w, from what research has been done would need to unlock it to get upto the 400+ watt. Might try it at a later time but it\'s really not worth IMO for a few extra mhz handful of frames. Nice to have the option though.The lighting is full RGB, comes default red. Do have to get the lighting app installed in order to change it, but after it\'s set it saves the setting on the hardware so can uninstall LED software after changing the color/effect which is awesome.Love being able to run everything around the same performance level as a RTX 3090 for $1k cheaper in today\'s wacky market. Like others have stated if you care about ray tracing this will get the job done but at lesser performance than an Nvidia 30 series but you will pay extra for that. Was going to go with a $3k 3090 but talked myself out of spending that much on a slightly better GPU, not worth.If you do go with this card you won\'t be disappointed. Happy gaming!', ""The io plate was bent but it was otherwise it's in perfect condition."", ""At $799 it's an ok buy.  I don't think it's a screaming deal by any means, but it's ok.  After several years of insanely overpriced cards this is sadly about as good as it gets.Performance is good, and it runs fairly cool which was a surprise.  I mean, it better, the heatsink on this thing is massive.  I have a 144hz 1440p monitor and for the vast majority of my gaming time I'm sitting right at 144 fps.  I'm quite happy with that.  I upgraded from a 5700XT which did fine, but rarely made it up to 144 fps in most games.I'm running with a 5800X and a bunch of fans off a Seasonic Platinum 750 watt PSU.  Total system power draw under heavy load is in the low 600ish watt range.  So as long as your PSU is good, 750 watts is fine.I'm also only using two power cables for it.  I thought I had enough outputs for three independent cables from my PSU, but I only had two.  So I'm using the pigtail ends to power two of the 8 pin connectors off one cable.  It works fine.  The total power that cable could theoretically draw is 300 watts, which is no problem for a decent PSU.  And in reality the total power draw for the entire GPU usually sits around 300 watts, which is split across the three connectors up top, as well as up to 75 watts from the PCIE slot itself.  So yeah, don't listen to the people who insist you must use three separate cables.  I've run mine on benchmarks for over 30 minutes at 100% utilization, no issues.The only downside I had was the shipping.  Amazon actually shipped me an $800 GPU in a plastic bag!  Not even a padded bag, just a thin piece of plastic.  No packing material.  Luckily the retail box is very well padded inside.  But seriously, expensive electronics with what amounts to a grocery bag for shipping?  Ridiculous."", ""First AMD, thank you for being open source. I use Linux and had NO problems installing drivers under Ubuntu. I am a design engineer and I do a lot of 3D renderings of detailed buildings and rooms and have had no problems plus the speed is remarkable. What would take 30 minutes to render now takes a 1 minute or 2. The GPU fan can be a bit loud but nothing some music can't overcome."", 'I\'ve had this card for the past few months, and one thing is certain, it plays games very well. I\'m running it on an LG 3440x1440 144HZ FreeSync monitor with HDR10, and it\'s nice having moved from my GTX 1070 (especially since Nvidia has been breaking G-sync support for even certified Freesync monitors on non-30 series cards). Frame rates are right were I\'d like to see them (well above 100FPS in most games even on ultra), and having proper variable refresh rate support is HUGE. On top of that, in games that support ray tracing, it does a good job. You do take a bit of a hit with Ray Tracing enabled, but not as big as you might expect given the hype from other manufacturers. When Ray Tracing is done well in a game, it adds so much to the experience.The large cooler keeps the rather toasty GPU nice and cool, with the hottest part of the die topping out at a nice 69 Celsius (reported) with the fans barely spinning when I ran a stress test on my system (~25.5C ambient, Corsiar 5000D Airflow, positive pressure config, running Furmark and IBT simultaneously).Aside from the wildly inflated price, there is one downside that may make or break purchasing this card for you: coil whine. I\'ve heard people complain about coil whine before, but I\'ve never experienced it in my own builds until now. This card has it bad. Fire up a game like Forza Horizon 5 and SCREEEEEEEEEEE. It wails at you like a banshee until you\'re actually in the game. I thought something was going wrong in my power supply, but nope, it\'s just the coils vibrating themselves to a potentially early grave.If I have any warranty issues, I\'ll be sure to update this review.Pros:• Very fast GPU• Lots of vRAM• Stays cool even with the fans on ""silent mode""• Super easy to overclock with the Radeon softwareCons:• Coil whine out the wazoo in high frame rate circumstances (like the opening screens for Forza Horizon 5)• Inflated price (currently $1599, but it should be around the $1200 range based on the launch MSRP)• Requires a header connection to sync RGB• RGB Header is flimsy and the pins are super easy to bend• ARGB cable is way too short', ""This thing is amazing. (Opinion). This card, the Ultimate, MSRP'S for $1599 (Fact) This is not a $999 Reference card. (Fact)  This card has an XTXH Binned chip. (Fact) please stop reviewing cards negative Because you over paid or don't want to pay scalper prices. This is a disservice to reviewing any GPU for its performance. If you want to rate a $999 good GPU of any brand or manufacturer as a bad value because your paid $3000, please stop. The value of a card should always be based on the MSRP never what you decided to pay.Now if your read through that,  this card is great. I personally don't have coil whine, or mine is not bad enough to notice. Power Colors custom cooler is genius. This air cooled card has taken everything I've thrown at it (I am not an extreme overclocker, though I do overclock)  and had never averaged over 72c. AMD, needs to pay Power Color what ever money they want in this world and make this cooler an industry standard. I really can't say that enough.  Good RTX lighting. (No it is not an Nvidia RTX card, it will never have RTX effects like an Nvidia card) If Ultimate RTX lighting is your go to thing. This won't be it. But still looks absolutely amazing. If you have to have DLSS. This doesn't have it. (Though I can not personally attest towards Super Fidelity FX.) I had a 2080 TI before this and never turned on DLSS. (Disclaimer:  DLSS is an amazing technology)TLDR: Fast, Cool, Quality,  Looks Amazing. Should you but it? This is a great card. It's worth whatever you feel is a fair price for this card. But if you $3000, and you have remorse, DON'T TRASH THE CARD.Thank your for reading my humble rambling."", 'This thing is a monster. I read a few comments about coil whine (which was minimal) but after running it hard to get it hot, the coils settled and I have yet to hear it again. It didn’t come with a PCI-E cover which was odd but I have zero problems with the card itself so it’s whatever. The only concern I have is that the box’s sticker seal was broken but everything is legit and I verified the product, so no issues but that is a bit odd. Other than those things, this thing is so awesome. Overclocked, not overclocked, doesn’t matter. On 1080p with max settings on any game I have yet to experience any stutter, lag, or any issues at all. I’ll be switching to 1440p here soon but at least on 1080, I have literally no problems it’s just amazing. It looks gorgeous. The thing came with a freakin support bracket too which is just unheard of and so sick. If you’re on the fence about this card, buy it. You won’t be disappointed. In comparison to the price hike of Nvidia cards especially the 3090, AMD cards are pretty reasonably priced and from my experience the availability is everywhere. In conclusion, this thing is just unbeatable so just do yourself a favor and buy it. Oh and also it I got Far Cry 6 and Resident Evil Village for free after the purchase so that’s just another reason to buy this beast.']"

About this one:- It is not that big (not small either) but you don't need extra clearance in a normal computer case.-Games of 2023 require cards like 1660super to play, thus with this 2060 you will be able to play even the most demanding games.- It is the best budget card out there, where you still can play everything but the price is a consideration (it is still expensive for a pice of hardware, looking at you NVIDIA!)-Nvidia new releases are geared to high end market. Chances are if you had that kind of money to trow around you would not be looking at this 2060-For the money this card and the 1660super are the best value, so look at the 2, check their price fluctuations and wait for a good opportunity to strike!

Ha!-Under games they are also quiet under load, not like a plane is taking off and passengers needed to fasten seat-belts, like with my old card. There are quieter cards models out there, but for the price this one excellent.-Very reasonable power supply (you need 8 pins) - a 550watt Power Supply is enough (if you dont have other crazy demands from your system) thus you will not need to upgrade your power supply unit in most cases.-Has a good port selection in the back.

Not a single frame rate drop (which is a heavy GPU game)I do have to say if you do get this card make sure get a cpu that can work with it wel so it doesn’t bottle neck on you.I highly suggest the AMD Ryzen 3600xWorks perfectly with it.Does it run hotter? Yes without a doubt so get your fans all set! Make sure there is good airflow through the system.If the fans are loud for you. Lubricate then with 3 in 1 oil.

Based on many professional reviews, this card performs better than the newer 3050 which was a successor.

I went from GTX 1650 to this rtx 2080 and there was a fatal driver error that prevented win11 boot up.... I fixed it by booting to safe mode and installing rtx driver.  Then it reboot properly in win11.The card is pretty plain looking so not a flashy card for gamer PC that has LEDs and glass cases.  But who cares. It runs fairly quiet. Fans are mostly silent until you really run the GPU hard.Having 3 do ports and 1 hmdi is handy. Gone are the dvi ports.  I don't have 4k nor 2k monitors.  Just regular 1080p.

But I took the chance on the MSI Ventus 2060 and I can honestly say it was a W for me. Before I couldn't play my VR games without screen tearing or lagging graphically. But once I upgraded to the 2060, my VR games are running at a clean 90 frames and sometimes more. Not to mention my other games like Call of Duty: Cold War now runs at a solid 135fps.

Additional info for users being led to believe one must have an nvidia (or any other manner) of account to obtain drivers.  Short answer: you don\'t.[I hope this doesn\'t get deleted by review process, this took a while to write..]These instructions presume you have at least a basic ad blocker, otherwise you may need to sieve through results to find the correct page, but since these are well known and long lived search targets they should be immediately after any links labeled ""paid for"" or whatever; I don\'t even recall what they\'re labeled, haven\'t seen ads in years.THIS FIRST STEP IS UNESSESARY, but, I strongly recommend it; if you don\'t have 7zip (the ideal option) or a similar program, search 7ZIP DOWNLOAD first.  7zip is free under the GNU/GPL license schema and is a legal, legit and well known alternative to pay for options.  7 hyphen zip dot org is their official home.  Any website trying to bundle it with something else or sell it is a scam.  Most likely you will want the 64 hyphen bit x64 Windows installer.  Assuming you did not have it already, or an alternative, after downloading it, select go to/open download location.  Install it, if you get the UAC prompts okay/pass/ignore them.  (I personally disabled all those annoying things, after over twenty years of building and fixing PCs I\'ve found far less disruptive ways to protect myself with out MS help)Now, whether or not you chose to get 7zip:Go to your search engine and enter ""nvidia drivers download""the desired result will literally be named ""NVIDIA Driver Downloads"".Follow link; you will presented with a list of pull down box options for product type, series, OS, etc.Go past this and select ""Beta and Older Drivers""  The main difference in results will be you will receive a list.Select product type ""Geforce"" Series ""Geforce 10 series"" Product ""GT 1030"" Operating System (select OS, if you don\'t know what it is and don\'t know how to determine what it is you will have to search for how determine that separately, but nvidia\'s driver download page usually autodetects your OS).  Driver type: ""DCH"" (long story why it has to be DCH, if you want to know you\'ll have to do research; the reasons aren\'t relevant here).  Recommended/Beta: select ""Recommended/Certified""Click search.  Click the first result then click download if it doesn\'t auto download.  Once it\'s done downloading, depending on your browser, select the pulldown next to complete or the downloads list and select GO TO/OPEN DOWNLOAD LOCATION.  Do not open the package directly from the browser!Once the folder the package went to shows CLOSE THE BROWSER and any other unessential programs.IF you installed 7zip (or have an alternative) right click the installer (named something like ""VERSION NUM desktop win10 win11 64bit international dch whql"") 7zip should be in the list, which will expand to a number of options.  One will say Extract to ""VERSION NUM desktop win10 win11 64bit international dch whql"".  Select that, and it will extract the contents of the installer to a folder with the same name as the file.  If you didn\'t get 7zip or don\'t have an alternative this is not a necessary step, it just saves time in the long run, because the installer won\'t be creating extraction directories which are annoying to find and eliminate after installation.So if you just run the installer package it will create a ""temp"" directory it won\'t delete afterward, but the extract first method bypasses the temp folder creation step, and makes post install cleanup easier since you know where the installation folder is, the same place the install package was downloaded to.  So if you went 7zip extract first method, go in to the folder the same name as the download and run setup.  You\'ll get more UAC nags to ignore.  If you went installation package route, it\'ll probably throw a UAC nag for extracting the files and a second for starting the setup.After this, it will do a compatibility check, then give two options: NVidia Graphics Drive and NVidia experience or just NVidia graphics driver.  SELECT NVIDIA GRAPHICS DRIVER (no NVidia experience).  Then Express or Custom.  Select CUSTOM.  In the list only Graphics Driver, HD Audio driver  and PhysX Software should be selected.  If you\'re only installing drivers for the first time, under current version should be all None.  If you previously installed drivers, or windows update auto installed drivers, the list might already be populated, and the one you DON\'t want ""NV GF Experience"" will probably be populated too.  In this case you\'re going to want to back out and look up how to disable windows update installing drivers.  Then you\'re going to want to go to ""Programs and Features"" and specifically uninstall Nvidia Gefore Experience (the four components are installed discreetly).  This may require a reboot.  Then you can go back to setup, follow the same selections, and NV GF Experience should read ""none"" and you can install/update the latest drivers sans GFE.  This will eliminate any nags to create an nvidia account.If you rely on Windows Update for other driver updates, I would advise checking for and installing nvidia updates as described above before enabling driver updates via Win Update manually, and on a schedule of your choosing and convenience (once a month perhaps).  Windows update won\'t supersede nvidia driver installation preferences, since as far as I am aware it will not download the windows update catalog version of the nvidia drivers unless it detects the primary driver (the graphics driver) is out of date.I hope this helps anyone frustrated by nvidia drivers seeming to bother or beg for the creation of an nvidia account; that\'s Geforce Experience producing those nags, not the actual drivers, and NVGFE does not improve performance, it\'s yet another drag on system resources if the system is already on the weak side.  But some people will argue vociferously the opposite is the case with no objective evidence.  I\'ve done the tests.  I know for a fact it does add overhead.  But the decision of its utility versus its performance cost is up to the end user.I hope this helps some people out there, and I hope it isn\'t rejected by customer review control..', 'OK, it arrived on time, but that is sort of an issue. When I purchased this product, Amazon guaranteed delivery on Sunday Feb. 6, 2022. On the 6th, I woke up to an email that it would be delayed until Monday the 7th. No problem, we had a blizzard and people have been digging out. BUT, it was delivered on Sunday and just left outside, in the freezing cold and snow, without me knowing or expecting it was going to happen. Luckily, a friend stopped in for five minutes, and by coincidence that\'s when the package was left in the cold and snow, so it wasn\'t there when he came up the porch, but it was there when he went down and my package got to me safely. The seller bears no responsibility for this, as it was fulfilled by Amazon, but for some reason, Amazon doesn\'t let us write reviews for the customer service, so here it is. You can do better, Amazon.As for the product itself, it\'s not really as bad as my ""stars"" would suggest. It arrived in what appears to be brand new packaging. I can\'t find any evidence that the anti-static bag was ever opened before. I installed it in my aging Dell Inspiron 3700 (with an i5-8400, and 12GB of RAM) hooked it all up, turned it on, and after about 5 minutes of some installation process (at which time there WAS video) my screen automatically reverted to the display settings it had prior to the install, and it works just fine. I installed Nvidia GeForce and, after one more driver update it was over. The entire process was from start to finish was less than 20  minutes.This was the first time I have ever installed a GPU, and I can only assume that that is EXACTLY how it is supposed to work. As for the value for money, NO GPU has a good value to money ratio. Crypto-miners and the pandemic have seen to that.As for gaming, this just is NOT a card built to plays today\'s most advanced games. I got this card because PGA 2K21 can only track one profile at a time, so two people with two profiles need two copies of the game to track their stats in co-op. Now, my aging Dell could manage about 25 FPS in ""potato mode,"" a number that made it unplayable. With this card, on low settings (one step up from potato mode), this card and the i5 deliver 90FPS steadily at 1080p quality.The problem there, is that 2K21 is really ""The Golf Club 3"" with 2K\'s marketing slapped on the box. As such, the entire install from Steam was just 6.6GB. And as every modern gamer knows, the 5-15GB game file size was lost to any game above the \'indie"" classification when the games went 4K. Which means that the game would have to still be in potato mode if 4K textures even existed in the files for processing.The only other ""modern"" game I have on the Dell is Kerbal Space Program. And that, with low settings turned on, and the FPS locked to 80, this card and the i5 can get maintain a steady 60 in the assembly buildings and launchpad, and dropped into the 40 FPS range during the launches I tested. But that is normal. KSP can make even monster PC\'s cry for mercy if the user launches a big enough ship. The limitation there is far more CPU dependent than GPU dependent as the game tries to simulate physics, heat, and gravity calculations on hundreds of individual parts simultaneously.As for video streaming, honestly, I don\'t see very much improvement over the streaming quality of just the i5, but there is no LESS quality to the streaming, and that\'s what matters. My monitor is a 32"" 1440p, with a 144 Hz refresh rate.I do, however, have a couple of issues with this card. On the product description page, there is clearly a picture of the various output I expected to find on this card. And if I remember right that picture had a display port, an HDMI port, a 24 pin DVI port, and a VGA port (I might be wrong about the VGA port). The card that arrived at my house, does NOT have either a VGA port or a display port. So, if your monitor has either of those, BUYER BEWARE!!! I was only ever going to use the HDMI port, so I\'m not too fussed.My bigger issue is the plastic shroud on the GPU itself. The card doesn\'t cover the same amount of area that the plastic shroud does, so I have several square inches of exposed plastic shroud inside my PC, acting as a ""bowl"" to catch any dust flying around. And while the Dell has a paper filter the covers the main air intake, and a sort of cone directing the CPU exhaust directly out into the room and that has kept the amount of dust inside my case to a minimum. But now there is the GPU fan sourcing air from an unfiltered area, and just exhausting the air inside the case. So, ALL bets are off as to how this plays out in the remaining life left in my aging Dell.That is just BAD design all the way around. It uses more material than is strictly needed meaning the manufacturer is paying more than is strictly necessary for each card manufactured, and it CAN\'T be good for the PC to have an actual dust catcher inside a machine that you work hard to keep dust free. And I can PROMISE the manufacturer, that if my aging Dell suddenly dies six weeks from now, I know EXACTLY who I will blame. I won\'t get a refund, but THEY won\'t get a return customer.And for that reason, ultimately, I will give this GPU a 3-star rating with a serious ""BUYER BEWARE"" due to the misleading product photos, as well as the poorly designed fan shroud.', 'Funziona, non riscalda molto (~50°c), ha i suoi 4GB di vram, ma sconsiglio se dovete giocarci, tanto vale la scheda grafica integrata', 'Sono riuscito a giocare egregiamente su resident evil 4 remake . 720p medium settings .

I am using it in an HP Pavillion with an I5 8400 CPU and a 180 Watt power supply and it does just fine.

I think the card uses about up to 30 watts. I'm still thinking about upgrading at some point but there is nothing wrong with this card. I play World of Warcraft mostly and on medium settings with every on low and get 60 FPS solid unless in a major city. All in all I would say it's a great card.

I'm no heavy gamer, more than happy playing games around 40-50fps with medium to high graphic settings. I like my games to look good when playing you see. I chose this card because MSI tend to be good with build quality. Ignore the reviews saying the x2 mech cooler is poor. It's only poor if you have poor ventilation. And to prove my point, I was playing on this card in an old battered case 13 yrs old & the idle temps were  45-50c. I then bought myself a model case with better cooling & my idle temps 35-40c. Big difference in temps with better cooling.On the gaming stand point, I have my graphics set to high or very high so bare this in mind & this taken from AMDs console for average FPS.CS:Go 255 fps.Ark: Survival Evolved 67fpsDayz: 77fpsRust: 84fpsRed Dead Redemption 2: 62fpsTerraTech: 58fpsSnowRunner 177fpsValheim: 122fpsMinecraft: 90fps. But this based on your mods, shaders & so on so really may differ significantly for you.The only downside I've noticed is when encoding video's as I do a lot of video editing. When encoding using AMD VCE to H.265, there's pixilation on detailed scenes that flick back & forth. With NVidia you don't get this. The FPS is higher with this card than with my 1060 3GB, but I've ended up sticking the 1060 3GB into my old tower with a FX 8350 & it encodes all my video's instead.So for a gaming stand point, brilliant card for £400, but for a video editing. For the problem's I've had with it with video quality, I would stick to NVidia who seem to have mastered this with their cards. That said, this could change with better AMD drivers so who knows.Hope this helps."", 'So far, so good, but I am second-guessing this product (see below). Due to price, I chose MSI over ASRock because MSI has been longer in the GPU game. But I have heard that MSI\'s AMD GPUs are inferiorly built compared to its Nvidia GPUs.Pros:1. Fits in my small PC case. This was one of only four RX 6700 XT variants that would fit in my case.2. Performs well enough, when it works (see cons below).Cons:1. Cooling could be better. The GPU runs a little hot, and while it seems to remain within spec temperature wise, I can\'t tell whether thermal throttling occurs when reaching peak junction/hotspot temperatures.2. Even in Nov 2022, I am experiencing driver crashes. However, I can\'t tell if the issue is with the silicon on this device, the AMD drivers, AMD\'s Adrenalin software, or the games (e.g., Tom Clancy\'s The Division 2) that I\'m playing. I experienced some crashes with my previous Nvidia GPU, but I am experiencing many more with this AMD GPU. (I\'m using Windows 11.) I\'ve tried different driver versions, while using DDU to erase every trace of NVIDIA and AMD drivers in between. The uncertainty on whether this is a hardware or a software issue is driving me to consider switching to a different product/brand.3. Not an issue with the product, but might affect whether one buys said product: After registration, the product\'s webpage does not specify when its warranty will end. It just states, ""Standard Warranty: Depending on territory Regional differences may apply. Please enquire with the original shops."" I bought it from Amazon U.S., which should be an authorized retailer, but I\'ve asked MSI customer support twice already on what date this product\'s warranty will expire. Each time, they gave me the same generic, textbook answer: paraphrasing, ""3 years after manufacture date (May 2025) or 3 years after purchase date (Oct 2025)."" There are 4 months between the two dates, which could make a difference down the line. I have another GPU from an MSI competitor, and that product\'s page states the exact date when the warranty will expire.Edit: After 3 attempts, I finally received the exact date of my warranty\'s expiration, 3 years from time of purchase. This, however, came in an email from customer service, while the product\'s page remains vague about the warranty.', 'Funktioniert tadellos aber habe noch nicht richtig getestet', ""Avendo acquistato la scheda usata avevo dubbi sullo stato della stessa, ma mi sono ricreduto quando è arrivata, funziona benissimo e era in ottime condizioni.

I dropped the GPU boost clock to near minimum, and GPU voltage to 1071mV and while the coil whine is still there, it is reasonable. It only becomes loud when running stress tests. The best part was that in underclocking the gpu, I was able to gain 5% additional performance (at least in furmark).I tried calling support, to see if it could be RMA'd.

Honestly, I attribute that to not realizing the amount of heat that setup would produce. But that was two series of boards ago, since then not one problem,But here I should speak about the AMD graphic cards. We have been using the 6800XT's since they came out simply because we find, especially for certain types of gaming, they will surpass the Nvidia 3080ti's, and do so for about 30%-40% less investment.

I needed something that could not only support Windows 10, but also macOS12, so decided to ""upgrade"" to this one, the Gigabyte AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT OC Gaming. What a mistake.Upon opening the box, I experienced issues. First, it doesn\'t give picture on boot. I have attempted to boot it using multiple combinations of Display Port/vs/HDMI/vs/VGA-DP-adapter/etc with multiple combinations of monitors, and with all attempts, it boots black. I discovered that I have to unplug and replug back in the cable to even get picture, AFTER I\'ve already booted, for it to work. This is extremely annoying, but even moreso is the volume. IT IS SO LOUD. I work in a few rather large programs, Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects probably being the most graphically demanding, and IT BUZZES SO LOUD ANY TIME I\'M RENDERING ANY VIDEO OR ANIMATION!!! It sounds like a fan running up against a piece of paper, or that sound you get when running your fingernail along the toothed-edge of a comb. It also does it with as minimal a graphical process as opening a browser window or scrolling a page, but it\'s EXTREMELY noticeable when rendering video, animation, graphics and running even moderately graphically intense computer games, like Genshin. Please refer to attached video for demonstration!! IT IS SO LOUD!!!After discovering this, I ran a few render-tests using a previous RAW, 1-minute video that I produced in Premiere Pro and After Effects, last month.1. Using macOS10.13.6 High Sierra on a 1TB SSD, a start-to-finish render took 7 minutes with my NVidia.2. Using Windows10 on a 250gb SSD, a start-to-finish render took 8 minutes with my NVidia.3. Using Windows10 on a 250gb SSD, a start-to-finish render took 9 minutes with this AMD.4. And using macOS12 Monterey on a 1Tb NVMe, a start-to-finish render took 6 minutes with this AMD.I only wish that NVidia was compatible with macOS12, because based upon the Windows performance tests that I ran, something tells me it may have done even better. And quieter. While this Gigabyte AMD was buzzing about to its heart\'s content the entire time, my 5-year-old EVGA NVidia was dead silent through every test.On top of all of that, I contacted Gigabyte about my issue, and they won\'t replace the card that appears to be defective out of the box. They told me that I could either send it in for repairs, which may take up to 3-4 weeks, or they can send me a refurbished one. OBVIOUSLY that\'s not an option to me, as I just bought this BRAND NEW. I contacted Amazon, and they were only willing to give me a refund, not an exchange, which also is very frustrating, because I NEED a macOS12-compatible card that\'s either better or on-par with my previous NVidia, right now. I got this card for a good deal (meaning, still over $1200, pfft), and know that the likeliness of getting it for the same deal again is slim.No matter, unless you\'re forced to get AMD, like myself, I don\'t recommend this card.

Delivering a harmonious blend of power, cooling, and aesthetic appeal, this card deserves an excellent rating of 9.6 out of 10.A standout feature of the AORUS RTX 3070 Master is its exceptional performance. With the robust Ampere architecture at its core and 8GB of GDDR6 memory, it delivers impressive speed and power to handle demanding gaming and creative workloads. This GPU can effortlessly run the latest games at high settings and resolution while maintaining smooth frame rates.The cooling solution of this GPU is another noteworthy aspect. The triple Windforce fans, combined with the advanced heat sink design, ensure effective cooling during intensive tasks. This keeps the GPU at optimal temperatures, thus promoting performance stability and longevity.Aesthetically, the AORUS RTX 3070 Master is an attractive piece of hardware. Its sleek design, complemented by customizable RGB Fusion 2.0 lighting, brings an added level of flair to your PC build.A unique benefit is the dual BIOS feature, which provides a fail-safe for those venturing into overclocking or tweaking settings, offering peace of mind alongside performance.Despite these strengths, there are a couple of potential drawbacks. The GPU's larger form factor could pose compatibility issues with smaller cases. Furthermore, as a premium GPU, it carries a premium price tag, potentially putting it out of reach for budget-conscious gamers.In summary, the Gigabyte AORUS GeForce RTX 3070 Master 8G Graphics Card is a formidable contender in the high-performance GPU market. Its powerful performance, advanced cooling system, and stylish aesthetics make it a compelling choice for gaming enthusiasts and content creators alike. Although the size and price might be a concern for some, the overall value and capabilities of this GPU justify these minor caveats."", 'I just assembled my first gaming pc, and it runs soo fast and noise free!

The temperatures are amazingly cool sitting at an extremely cool 50-65 Celsius during heavy gaming such as Modern Warfare: Warzone at a constant stable fps of 150+ on high and Escape From Tarkov at all high with a constant fps of 90-100+ There is absolutely no coil whine and is extremely quiet.

But 3200 or 3466 and 3533MHZ are stable always.3666 MHz more unstable than 3600mhz. Not sure what to do with this GPU. Seems like it has a hard limit at 3600mhz and beyond and a few other limits at various points up until there.My kit is only guaranteed up to 3600mhz... And I was.doing 1.35 volts on it.. worked fine with my old GPUs the EVGA 1070 FTW and EVGa 1080Ti SC Black.This is clearly an Nvidia 30 series problem.Overall I am very disappointed. It's a common design flaw apparently, read 3rd party forums, others also have this issue on the 3080, not just the 3070.Hopefully Nvidia does better next year with RTX 4000 card or I'm switching to AMD.It's just unacceptable to have a GPU not accept common XMP settings."", 'Perfect in new conditions, Thank you', 'Very good.

(CorelDRAW Essentials 2020)Use a blade to cut the clear tab on the top flap.Includes: Retail box, software disc DVD and a Digital Download info card if you have no optical drive.This can be used to do your page layout, typography and your vector illustrations.Started using CorelDRAW in 2000. It's what got me hooked into the arts.I've been using Illustrator from version 5, and stopped using the cloud version in 2019.I'm so done with renting of software.Corel does have a cloud based service.I'm interested in physical software only.On the Corel website they say that this is for Occasional graphics users.I will have to agree. The next step up is CorelDRAW Standard and then CorelDRAW Graphics Suite.This version can get you started into the world of vector.The standard version has more features and tools. (Bevel tool, Shadow tool, Spiral, Smoothand Smear tool) (Clone Tool, Artistic Media) (Alignment guides, Guidelines docker)Full version has another 20 features and tools.My thoughts on this version.This version is crippled with so many missing tools and features.I'd recommend this to someone starting out only or anyone that only needs basic core functions.You can do some amazing things with your text and basic shapes with this version.Importing a photo and with one right click (Quick Trace)This will convert your image into a vector.No settings at all with this version!Better options come with the better versions, hence more control.The one nice thing, is you can go to the Properties of the new vector and then apply Bitmap Effects by hitting the +then adjust. You'll have a few options to choose from.One thing that i like to do is ungroup the vector.Then you can go into each part and make your adjustments to the nodes, change the fill or outlines etc.Maybe paying the monthly subscription fee would be better for someone like myself.If your new to vector drawing software, this should be a good place to start.I created a kind of doodle page, trying out the different shape tools etc.Later creating a doodle of a landscape using gradients and texture fills.Created a 3rd sample page using the Quick Trace feature and then applying effects.Wanted to try out something. I took out some paper and did a quick sketch, then took a photo with my phone.Imported into Corel and then used the Quick Trace. If you need to adjust you can goto Bitmap Effects.The results will vary.Or use an app on your phone to clean things up before importing.Give it a try, can't hurt. You just have to work harder."", ""I want to start out this review by stating that I have a bachelor's degree in Studio Art, and have spent a lot of time with Adobe Illustrator as my main vector software. Now, as a graduate student in a non-art-related field, I can't justify paying a monthly subscription for Adobe CC (or any other major design software, for that matter). I saw this product and was immediately excited to try it - a one-time license vector program? My dream come true!Before getting into how the software perfomed, I want to mention that it was great that I had the option to either use or not use the included disc for installation - I hadn't even realized that my relatively-new laptop didn't have a disc drive until I got this in the mail and went to install. Disc-free instructions are included right inside the box and it was a super easy process. Now, back to the software!I thought the best way to review this would be for me to try to do the same thing in CorelDRAW that I had previously done in Adobe Illustrator, just to see how the finished products look. I've attached the finished products here. It's obvious to see that the lines on the CorelDRAW image aren't as crisp, likely due to the fact that this particular version of CorelDRAW doesn't have the same kind of pen tool that Illustrator does (womp womp). Instead, this program utilizes a more freehand vector drawing approach, and relies on those vectors being manipulated post-creation than them being created exactly how you'd like them in the first place. For me, this was a bit of a challenge as I'm not the best digital freehander, but could be a huge boost to someone using a Surface tablet or a Wacom. It is worth noting that there is the option to create perfectly straight vectors, as well as a number of basic shapes, all of which can have additional editing points added to them for further manipulation. This process felt a bit awkward to me when I gave it a go, but might work really well for someone else.Overall, as someone used to all the bells and whistles of Illustrator (specifically the pen tool), I'm not incredibly wowed by this particular product. That being said, I'm not the target market for this software - novices, hobbyists, and the casual user are. Keeping that in mind, it has some major plus points:- The tool selection is broad enough for basic functionality without being intimidating- The software is visually easy to understand and non-intimidating- With a little time and patience, results similar to Illustrator can be achieved as a much lower price pointThis software is really great for someone just looking to venture into vector design for personal use. While I did take a star away for some general klunkiness and lack of features, I don't think that these points would matter as much to a novice who is unfamiliar with what else might be available."", 'Good product. It does everything I need and it is easy to use. Fast delivery too.', ""I wasted 35 days with 34 emails and chats to tech, who cannot fix this program - they tell you to 'clear cache' and 'restore default setting over and over, none of which work. crashes constantly, and will not save the work I did. india tech support wants to 'take over my computer'  to try and fix it - NO WAY!  what a joke - now the 30 day return is over and i'm stuck with a program that is useless."", 'Stability, ease of use,', 'Really not sure where this product fits in the wider range of graphics software. For beginners, MS paint is good enough. For advanced users, Photoshop and the Adobe suite is a much better fit. I think the intent of this software is to go somewhere in between MS paint and Photoshop but it is much closer to MS paint. CorelDraw can not process photos. You can do most of the same things using MS paint and that is a much more stable platform. Personally. not impressed.', 'I’m a long time user of both CorelDraw and its competitor which I will call AI.For the PC, I have used Corel products and for the Mac I have used Adobe products and when I had my own graphic design business, I used a Mac and thus for over a decade, I’ve stuck with AI.Now I’m back with a PC and it’s a new beginning and so I had a chance to start using CorelDRAW Essentials.It’s important to note that there are three versions of the software: CorelDRAW Essentials 2020, CorelDRAW Standard 2020 and CorelDRAW Graphics Suite 2020.For the most part, CorelDRAW Essentials is a stripped down basic version of its CorelDRAW Graphic Suite software.  And that may be fine for a lot of people.If you want to create vector-based graphics, create logos and such, you can do it all with CorelDRAW Essentials.For me, I’ve depended on a few things as a professional graphic designer and that was a reliance on Pantone colors (as major businesses/hospitals etc.) tend to work with Pantone colors.  Essentials does not offer this in the global options and looking at the comparison sheet of all three software, the CorelDraw Graphics Suite 2020 is the version I would need for Pantone.I also tend to do some tracing and it appears that Essentials 2020 doesn’t have it, while Standard has quick trace and again CorelDRAW Graphics Suite 2020 does have that option.As for other tools such as bevel or shadow, Standard or the full suite has those options.And last, my clients are dependent on CYMK and this version doesn’t offer it, only the Graphics Suite.  Image rendering of 300 dpi, you need the Graphics Suite.So for my needs, I need to go with Graphics Suite it seems.But for others, if you are needing it to create cool logos and designs, CorelDRAW Essentials 2020 may be all that you need.But for professionals coming off from AI and need many features especially pertaining to color and tracing, definitely go for CorelDRAW Graphics Suite 2020 instead.']"

I decided to share my opinion and evaluation of the graphic card at this stage and right after a super fast hardware installation on my PC which officially retired the previous model Asus-GTX 1060 3GB. So after the hardware replacement I just turned on my computer and I had my screen display almost about the same time I used to wait before. It's also good to mention that, I never had a bad experience with Asus in the past, not on my graphic card and not on anything else I have ever used but Asus was never my preferred brand like the way MSI is and with this purchase once again it was proven to me how superior the MSI production line is in comparison with all others. And this card is actually one of the most expensive cards on 1660 Super and at the time of purchase none of the available MSI series were close to the base price of the 1660 Super but again I had an intention to pay the difference and try this particular one. I was debating with myself on either the Gtx 1660 Ti or 1660 Super and I searched almost any reliable sources on the internet to get a fair comparison differences and as you guys know, they both have a lot in common but there are still differences which some people might care about. The price differences at the time of purchase between these two models was almost $10 and this the 1660 Ti which was gradually losing it's original price tag to become more competitive with the new comer.  Anyway, I did installed almost everything from the scratch and I tried to do a fresh installation for as much as it was possible and I also added all MSI available utility software available for this card and started to get the tests. The results were impressive and I really don't want to copy and paste bunch of numbers here that you can simply find elsewhere. What I like to stress out on this particular card and after being patient for a very long time period for this production line to become available in the market is started shining when I started playing with the same games I used to play with my virtual reality headset and that was when I truly realized how powerful this card really is. It's all about going to the maximum level of a game can be played and I could never ever get even close to it with the previous model, it's about the picture clarity and speed in parallel with full functionality and responsiveness specially when you are doing VR in order to avoid getting dizzy or feeling bad and ... it's about the power of new gaming architectural design also known as Turning Shaders and.... The card itself is very solid with great dimensions which I believe it fits easily even in mid sized cases but mine is a full size case. The beautiful design and RGB (adjustable with MSI Mystic Light) it looks great while blazing performance of the card, blown your mind away. Finally about the fan and the temperature (which I can only speak about this card), even after tweaking the variables on MSI Afterburner and overclocking the card, you still don't hear any sound from the card and if you don't put the card under heavy load, you don't even see the fans rotations. It's truly quite a peace of art with today's technology.I would definitely update my review if anything negative or unexpected happens but for now I would highly recommend this card to anyone who is interested in doing what I was planning to do.The only reason you might want to hold on buying this card for your system is if you are waiting to see what finally supposed to come out of the AMD production line which is understandable but you might need to replace your UPS if you ever need to shift with AMD GPU in the future. Just be aware!Hardware Config. CPU: 8700K, Liquid cooling: Corsair Hydro series120mm, MSI z370-a pro, RAM: 32 GM Corsair (Intel XMP), Graphics Card: MSI Gtx 1660 Super (Gaming X), HDD: Samsung 1 TB 850 Evo, UPS: EVGA 500 W, (Windows 10 pro 64 bit- latest update Nov. 2019)."", 'I bought this to replace a 1050 TI (also an MSI product with twin frozr fans) in my modest ""quiet"" build and the difference has been dramatic. Despite being specced 50 watts higher than the 1050 this 1660 might even be quieter than what I had because of the remarkable cooling solution it uses.Everything I was doing either runs faster (emulation, encoding/decoding), at my monitor\'s native 1440p instead of 1080p (JRPGs/indie/ps4 era games), or as in the case of Cyberpunk 2077 and other ""modern"" titles becomes legitimately playable at all if you\'re willing to ""settle"" for 1080p. If anything I\'m now CPU bound for the first time in like 10 years.That said, unless you\'re upgrading from as old of a GPU as I am and noise levels are more important to you than raw performance this probably isn\'t a great choice at what I paid for it (~$270 new) to start 2023, especially since I still need to upgrade my CPU. Also definitely not worth it at the $350(!) it\'s listed at as I type this since that blows puts you into 3060 territory and there are a variety of AMD options between $150-400 (including just settling for integrated graphics) which might make more sense depending on your situation.The gaming X line from MSI is pretty great though and definitely worth going over budget for compared to simpler cards if noise is a concern for you.', 'Me parece muy bien diseño la gráfica aunque el único ""problema"" es q en mi gabinete ya no le pude poner una regita por q estorba la parte plástica del ventilador de la tarjeta pero pues fuera de eso sin problemas ya no me interesa mucho lo estético ya q también lo puedo poner en vertical y otra cosa las temperaturas son muy buenas lo máximo q se me a calentado en temporada primavera fue 77° juegos como apex o valorant ya de allí estado jugando en 57 q es lo q identificado', ""Upgraded to this card from a GTX 960 on my aging system and the difference is night and day.I'm not an enthusiast by any means and am mostly doing retro streaming in 1080p60fps which the card handles great.  I'm also able to do some casual gaming in 4k.  Stellaris looks great and I'm even able (with some tweaks) to push 55-60 fps in most areas in 4k with Final Fantasy XIV.Installation was simple.  Fan noise levels are about what you'd expect if this isn't your first budget card.  The included software makes overclocking safe and simple.Highly recommend this card for anyone looking to get the most for their money.  There's a reason my last 2 cards have also been MSI.  They know what they're doing."", 'La compre hace 3 meses sin saber mucho de hardware, creí que por su precio era una grafica media-alta.

This isn't a super high end gaming card but if you are not a serious, hard core, gamer, this is the card for you.  The prices are above suggested retail right now so that's why the low value score BUT that should ease up as the pandemic weakens and the supply chain gets stronger.  For what I do with 4K content editing and production this card works quite well as a replacement for my old card that was at the edge of not being quite enough card for all that. I have a Tri-monitor setup so the 3 Display Ports work perfectly to run those and that left the HDMI port open to run my 4K UHD projector.  Even with all of these running at once, this card doesn't skip a beat BUT the variable speed cooling fans do ramp up when running all that at once!  That is a nice feature of this card, when not needed and the card is at a low graphic processing load, the fans slow down so much you can't even hear them, not that they are very loud at full load/speed to begin with!"", 'GPU market was at the worst state for most gamers.

Fortnite on competitive settings on proformance mode will easily grant you over 300 fps in mostly all scenarios in the game, this card is also a pretty decent overclocker as I can get +130 mhz to the boost clock in msi afterburner. Overall great value card for the proformance you get', 'Over clocking is great', 'easy to install , i play eve online and it goes over what i expected .so ya i can run easy 5 toon on high quality !!!! wich is amazing no lag :))']"

It\'s marginally better then the 5700xt but the fact remains it is *better* so it\'s still worth getting this over the 5700xt. But honestly the real reason to get it over the 5700xt is not the extra frames but the Nvidia software you gain access to with it which is infact purely better then AMD and doesn\'t look to be caught up to for a while. Absolutely best buy if you arnt going crazy and buying the 2080 TI(the 2080 Super is just flat not worth it when the 2070 super exist). Please note though do not buy this card if all you do is play on high and add mods. This card is very much for heavy load gaming which only applies to select and mostly non popular titles.

The material is thick, and very sturdy.  The rest of it you can tell was made in China.  The cable is stiff but good quality. Though when it arrived it was horridly packaged.  One standoff was not screwed in well because the tapped hole was burred. The tap was amateur at best and I had to de-burr then re-tap the hole myself.  The slot mount holes are just a bit too small to let the screw through and screw down to the base (if you get one you will quickly understand what I mean).Once you get it all together and get passed all the design flaws then it will work and will look good in a case.UPDATE: Ok, so I got further into my build, and I am finding that the strudiness of this is really a key KEY feature.  I have a couple of different vertical mount kits from the market and I believe this is probably the best one once you get past the flaws (which I call some fit and finish issues like poorly tapped screw holds, packaging, etc.)  The killer design of this is that they have a support screw at the opposite end which gives this two points of support one where it attaches to the PCIE slot/brackets and a lift screw at the other end.  This is so much better than what I have seen elsewhere on the market, it is enough to give out this as probably the best, no mod vertical mount provided your case is large enough (mine is).  It sets the card off well and pushes it back far enough that cabling is not a problem at all.  I must say, after mounting and working with this I am thoroughly impressed.  Pushed it from 2 stars to 4, 5 stars would be warranted if I did not need to de-burr and re-tap screws holes.UPDATE2: So I am now going to say this is probably the best generic vertical mount GPU bracket available that does not require you to cut and modify your expensive case or that is not part of the original case design.  Still at a solid 4 stars for the issues listed above and because of the packaging/lack of instructions.  Reading through other reviews there were others who could not figure out how to assemble and mount it.  Fair enough, if you never used one I can see that.  Took me about 5 minutes but for the inexperienced I can see this as frustrating.  The most important thing to keep in mind is that this mount sets the graphics card back, and away from the PCI slats in the back plane by a good 40-50 mm (maybe about 2 inches) so it will be hard to use a large video card in a small case, you will likely run out of room in less roomy cases.  Beware.', 'Quedó más o menos bien instalado, solo que noté varios detalles que no me han dejado muy conforme, aunque decidí no devolverlo, porque ya me tocó devolver uno de estos a Amazon USA hace algún tiempo, y en Amazon México me hicieron el reembolso de otro producto (un mouse pad que quería mucho y resultó no corresponder a lo que pedí) hace unos días. No me siento a gusto con situaciones de este tipo, a mi me gusta pagar por lo que adquiero, aunque a veces si mi inconformidad lo amerita, decido hacerlo.Van las observaciones:1. El cable decía que era de 250mm, me llegó de 300mm, algunos dirán que es bueno, sin embargo se amontona de más si tu gabinete es más angosto, como mi Cougar Panzer-G, ya había realizado algunas mediciones y el de 25cm hubiera sido perfecto, pero logré acomodarlo.2. Venía golpeado de la parte frontal, una pena, tuve que pintarlo y esperar a que estuviera seca la pintura para seguir con el ensamble.3. No trae instructivo de ensamble ni de instalación, pero realmente no es muy complicado deducir cómo hacerlo funcionar.4. Tiene patitas con imanes en la parte inferior (cosa muy buena si no puedes fijarlo bien en los tornillos de las ranuras de expansión PCie), uno de imanes llegó roto, en la bolsita venían todas las partes, me dí a la tarea de pegarlo con calma y quedó perfecto.5. Hay que tener cuidado, tengo dos monitores conectados con Displaty Port, estos conectores normalmente son más largos que un HDMI, por lo que acomodar los cables se vuelve tedioso y hay que encontrarles su forma para no dañar el cable, el concetor, o las salidas de la GPU.6. Venía empacado de forma muy simple y me atrevería a decir que algo descuidada.Finalmente fue posible rescatar el producto y tuve que evitarme la pena de solicitar devolución o reembolso nuevamente, mi M.2 ya no se calienta tanto y el equipo luce muy bien. Como siempre la entrega excelente por parte de Amazon. Gracias.', ""I needed an option that would enable me to keep my water-cooled graphics card vertical (without pushing it close to the MB) and still allow space to install a rad and fan on the bottom of my case (underneath the gpu). I didn't want to mount my GPU horizontally and block the air that flows mostly from bottom to top in this case. To my surprise it worked beautifully. The cheap-feeling metal construction and black paint is mediocre admittedly and the mounting screws easily scratch the black paint off, leaving a silver circle behind. However, this was much more functional for me, unlike the more expensive CableMod vertical bracket that is primarily for air-cooled cards (pushes your GPU close to your MB and away from the side panel).Since the bracket had slotted holes, unlike most vertical brackets, I was able to slide it up and mount this to only the top 4 PCI-E slots (instead of using all 7 of them). However, the side mounting is not really holding the full weight here; it just adds rigidity. Most of the weight is probably on the bottom section with the magnetic feet. This adjustment allowed me to mount a 28-mm thick rad and fans underneath the bracket. The bottom part of the bracket sits nicely over the fan housings without risking anything clipping the fan blades. For my case if I wanted to use a thicker rad underneath I would have had to lose the side bracket (and with it some rigidity) and just use the bottom piece with the riser cable. In that case though you could just buy a cheap kickstand and you would also start to obscure your CPU at some point, depending on your case. If you have a nice CPU waterblock, you might want to show it off! I can still see my CPU waterblock, but from certain angles it is covered.I also just love the little details on this bracket. The bottom piece has long slots that allow air flow from the bottom of my case, and the PCI-E cable is sliced into 5 or so ribbon segments, so the air flow isn't completely blocked there. Also there are 2 options for mounting to the PCI-E slots on the back of your case, since you can mount that side section to the front or the back of the bracket. This allows you to display your vertical card closer to your glass panel OR push it closer to the MB for better air flow (for air cooled cards).The one downside for me is that the vertical gpu does somewhat obscure the view of my CPU waterblock now, but that is more to do with my case and not necessarily a criticism of this bracket.If anyone is curious my GPU is a Radeon VII with the EK Quantum Vector (plexi + nickel) waterblock in the EK-Classic InWin 303EK case."", ""I've instances where I've turned my PC on and have my GPU not turn on. I'll upload images at a later date but I'll describe my experience with it thus far.It's sturdy and appears well built. In my case, when I initially connected my GPU to the case after mounting it, it sat at an angle. The card was sitting diagonally as opposed to parallel to the motherboard as you would expect. I did a little modding to get it to sit correctlySecond, I installed it in a new build. When I'd put everything together and turned the PC on, the GPU initially didn't turn on. I did an emergency shutdown since I couldn't see anything on the screen and restarted it. This seem to do the trick. This has happened on two different occasions. At first it didn't occur to me that the mount was the cause but it finally clicked when it happened a few more times.That's been my experience with it so far, keeping in mind that I installed it about 4 days ago. I haven't tested whether it affects performance but I'll update this when I do so"", ""This came unassembled and loose in a non-descript box too large for the item inside. The screws were also loose in the box, I'm not even sure if all of them made it as there were gaps in the box.  The individual parts of the mount were scratched because everything was left to bounce around.  The riser card at least was in a plastic bag, but no telling if it was damaged by the pieces of metal bouncing inside.Second issue was the item design, it will not fit just any case.  In fact, of all the case I currently have or have had, this would not mount properly to any of them.  The threaded holes do not line up, no matter how the individual parts are oriented. Threaded are poorly cut and/or damaged preventing screwed from being inserted. Lastly, the magnets/feet are not attached.In summary, I could make a better mount with a few hours of free time (which I don't have much of), some scrap metal in the shop and a can of spray paint. Which is probably what I'll have to do after ordering the Phanteks universal rise card mount that also is somehow specific to certain cases.Anyway, hope this helps potential buyers from making the same mistake I did.  Of course, I could have cut this mount, drilled/tapped new mounting holes and made this work. For the purchase price, it was just not worth it.  As stated above, I could design and fabricate a better mount for much cheaper.  Therefor, this was returned."", 'The bracket it’s self is great, sturdy and easy to assemble and install. Instructions are not needed since it’s incredibly easy to put together. The riser cable is strong and not flimsy.The huge flaw; the screws and screw hole threads do not match whatsoever. You have to physically, and painfully screw the screws and it sucks. I spent more time with pliers and a screw driver trying to get the screws in and it’s impossible without breaking anything.Specially the magnetic feet. They were threaded at an angle and they don’t hold down tight making them completely useless.3 stars for the  bracket and riser. Everything else was a disaster. I would recommend above all others since a ton of them are flimsy, but they need to fix that huge issue.', 'In its stock form, it is great. Its a little long set on the mounting bracket. I would like it to be a little shorter, but i can make a new shorter piece for that. The lower mount is very nice with feet that sit on the psu cover, only problem is in my current case my ssd sit right in the way of using that feature. I am very happy with it right now, and after some modding it will be a perfect fit for my build.', 'Pretty decent vertical mount, I did have to do some adjustments to make it fit correctly and a couple zip ties.  But if you have common sense you can make it work..  I also painted mine white to match so all in all I like it.', ""Awesome vertical gpu mount! You don't have to mod or cut your case to make it work. The magnets on the bottom do a good job if you always work on your pc upright. I added a zip tie to the bottom portion and looped it through the cut outs on my case floor. That way I can lay it down without stressing the bracket part that attaches to the back of the case. Great price and I'm very happy with how it turned out. P.S. Add 4 pieces of eletrical tape to the magnetic feet. That way your case floor won't get scratched."", 'I like that the frame is an inch & half from the side of the case, the magnetic feet work well in a steel case, seams to be OK construction but the best is the split ribbon pci16 connecter.

Is it worth it, normally I would say unless you are a commercial business, no.  But because of the silicon shortage, then it is absolutely a  viable solution for low settings, entry level gamers with knowhow (see above about fan mods).  That being said, I would also say that if you can wait for another year (perhaps months), we are going to be seeing Intel ARC shortly and perhaps also a crap-ton of used GPUs being dumped by miners if crypto crashes like some are indicating.  Then again, if you do pick this up and mod it and then migrate to better gpu, it could go into a multi-media entertainment system and perform competently.That\'s my 2c on the RX 560X4EYEGX in Dec, 2021.', 'Edit: Customer Service swapped my flawed GPU with a new in box video card.It works well, 85fps in Cinebench. But it does have two issues, and they are tenable. The four rear outputs are mislabeled. I have a programs that looks for device default audio on ""Playback Device Digital Audio 1"". I had to put the cable in port 3 to make it do that in the sound properties.The fan on the GPU is erratic. I used Speedfan to work around. On the ""Fan Control Tab"" I made a ""Fan Controller"" and used GPU Fan from ATI Video Card as the ""Controlled Speed"". With my 50MM helper fan controlled by the CPU Temp, the temps stay between 26C and 53C.About one year ago I bought my first USED peripheral from Amazon, a MSi RX560 4GB that still works great. So when I discovered that the New VisionTek RX560 4GB LP I ordered was fulfilled with an open box instead. I didn\'t panic, because I always have a great experience with Amazon.How an open box got in with the New products, I will never know. The Amazon CS seemed surprised also, that I got an open box. But, she was very kind and ordered a replacement. So I predict happy days ahead.I did extensive trouble shooting prior to contacting Customer Support. And, after trying this GPU in 3 computers (W10 64 and W7 64), I am of the opinion, that this is a lightning strike or OC damaged GPU that was returned to Amazon. I would think it should have been RMA to VisionTek, for repairs.Since my PC had a working Radeon, a R7240 using V19.12.2 Adrenaline driver. I device manager uninstalled GPU driver, installed VGA and shut down. When RX560 card was installed, it booted, found it\'s driver in the Adrenaline package and rebooted, but halted after the W7 ""Starting Windows"" swoosh disappeared. I used DDA (removed the whole smack) driver uninstaller and tried the V19.12.2, V21.4.1 and V21.5.2. Got same freeze at boot but would reliably boot to W7 desktop in VGA or Safe Mode. In W10, it booted, found the Windows Standard Video Driver, (which looks pretty darn good BTW), but when I ran WUpdate and installed the AMD Driver, it rebooted and froze with a Blue Oops Screen. I was able to get W10 to the Desktop only in Safe Mode or VGA mode. I was certain by then, I had received my very first DOA GPU.I read that some users feel the 50mm fan is insufficient. Some even modded the stock fan or heatsink. I have tight quarters in my HTPC case, so I added a 50mm that blows on the heatsink to help cooling.', ""Ok, the GPU works as it should with last AMD adrenalin drivers like any other RX560, BUT the aluminum heatsink and fan are CRIMINALLY selected for that type of chipset. These small fans and heatsinks were found as standard on the GPU industry, and have been there in multiple low-end GPUs since early 2000s. Thus this is an old heatsink/fan combination design. The selection of these on this card puzzles me. Must be a reason behind, cutting costs may be the one.You really have 3 options when you are buying this card, if you plan to use it for GPU consuming demanding tasks such as gaming, rendering, etc:1. Wear earplugs. If is not under your control, the fan is VERY noisy. Not a little, but a lot, high pitch style.2. Let it run hot. There are software's that let you control the fan/power (such MSI afterburner). The card running the fan at 25% is comfortable and noise is not noticeable. As far as you keep it bellow 85 Deg, it should not present any issue.3. Mod it. There are cheap fans out there, (i.e Noctuas at $19) with some tinkering the small factory fan can be replaced by a better silent quality one. This will likely void the warranty so to each his own.So yes, the card is noisy as hell under load, but is also capable to run 4 monitors from it. If your tasks do not demand high GPU productivity such as MsOffice, web navigation etc this card, under software control could be also whisper quiet, but will stay hot which may sort the lifespan of it.Note, that it is priced in a really competitive price bracket for what it is so, there it is the trade off. Got mine for $220 where other brands are selling currently same or inferior chipsets for >$300 due to silicon shortages. Definitively not a GPU for all type consumers out there, a controversial design where you'll decide if suit your needs."", 'I bought this after reading some of the other excellent reviews, and knew what I was getting into.The PROs:its an RX560its a fair priceit has 4 ports, and adapters to use DVI or display port (2 of each)  (you will want to use display port for best refresh rates)It seems to work well several months inThe CONsNo HDMI adapters included. I did not need any, but others need to purchase separatelyThe heatsink/fan solution is just terrible, and the card runs extremely hot and noisy all the time.So I modded mine: I removed the tiny horrid fan, cut off the plug from it, and attached it to a 80 x 25 mm quiet fan I had lying around. I attached that over the heatsink (too big to fit in the little fan recess) using some foam stickies and zip ties to the PCB (there are obvious places you can do that without interfering with how it fits into your motherboard). Finally I installed Speedfan to take over control of the GPU fan speed to the profile I wanted to use.It still runs a little hot, but way better and far quieter.I get the frame rates I would expect for the games I play for an RX560', 'Solid built card works flawlessly in different operating systems. Comes with four breakout dongle’s with mini display port screw down terminals to DVI and two full-size display port dongle‘s. The card is perfect for a small form factor Computer also comes with a bracket for a full height card slot. My only complaint, I wish the heat sink and cooling fan was a little bit stronger, decent amount of heat separation from the GPU but not enough heat separation from the ram on the card. I wish it was more of a solid copper. Plate that cover the GPU and the ram.', ""I bought the VisionTek Radeon RX 560 with the intention of setting up a four-monitor workstation. Unfortunately, my experience with this graphics card has been rather disappointing and frustrating.Right from the start, I encountered issues after installing the card. Each monitor would briefly display an image and then go black, as if the signal from the card was being lost. Even after trying different cables and troubleshooting steps, the problem persisted.I decided to seek assistance from VisionTek's tech support. They suggested that an outdated video driver might be causing the problem and recommended using a third-party software called DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller). Despite following their guidance and trying various solutions, the issue remained unresolved.After consulting with customer support again, I was advised to send the card back to VisionTek for testing. Since I was still within the return window offered by Amazon, I opted to mark the card as defective and return it for a replacement. In the meantime, I reinstalled my old graphics card.Upon receiving the replacement card a few days later, I diligently followed the installation process: uninstalling the old drivers, installing the new ones, and swapping out the cards. Unfortunately, this time things took a turn for the worse. I couldn't get any signal to the monitor, and despite my efforts, the situation did not improve even when reverting to the old graphics card or attempting to use the onboard motherboard graphics.Frustratingly, VisionTek's customer support could only suggest sending the card back once more for testing. I even sought assistance from IT professionals, both internally and externally, but they too were unable to resolve the issue or establish a connection to the monitors, although the system was passing the POST test during boot.Eventually, I decided to utilize the manufacturer's warranty and sent the system for inspection. While they were able to fix some aspects remotely, the root cause of the problem remained a mystery. When I received my PC back, I cautiously tried installing the VisionTek card again, only to encounter the same blinking monitor issue.Unfortunately, due to the extended process involved in the manufacturer's warranty, I now find myself outside of Amazon's return window. This leaves me with a $200+ graphics card that I'm unable to use effectively, resulting in a rather frustrating outcome. While I had initially heard positive things about VisionTek and their US-based customer service, this experience has left me quite disappointed, and I'll be hesitant to purchase any more products from them in the future."", ""Worked fine while it worked, but it has now started crashing several times a day.

Air cooled only, but is still impressive.Longer story:I had an overly expensive GTX 690 in my Alienware PC. I later replaced it with a cheaper and better EVGA GTX 980Ti. After some amount of years I noticed the GPU was running hot. There was another malfunction w/ the PC, which killed that GPU, so I replaced it with this one.  Not much later, I built a new PC and put this GPU in. Since the 980Ti, I feel like I cannot settle for a non-Ti GPU with less than 6GB of VRAM. This GPU is a great replacement for the old one! It can even run Ark: Survival Evolved on epic settings, which I couldn't do before. It didn't always give me 60fps (frames per second) in those games, but it wasn't noticeable, Ark looked amazing once I played it with this GPU! I did eventually see it reach just over 90fps in a certain area. As I said, I'm very impressed with the price/value of this GPU. I'm also impressed that it doesn't require as much power as my last two GPUs, but still performs better. I'm also really impressed with it's cooling capacity. Near the end of their lives, my two previous GPUs got hot, reaching the 80's and 90's (Celsius) easily. I remember near the end of it's life the 980Ti would reach the 60's and 70's just idling. The idle temp of this one is high 30's, mid 40's. I tested it with some software I can't recall the name of. Under heavy load it did reach 80c, which concerned me. I asked EVGA and they said that this is definitely within tolerable range for this GPU. While gaming it hasn't reached 80c, which is impressive for an air cooled GPU. At first I was disappointed that I couldn't find some kind of AIO water cooling unit for it, but I've since realized that it doesn't need it. I did try to overclock it, but I don't think I really noticed a difference in performance. The only reason I noticed an increase in FPS and how fast it was running was by monitoring it with EVGA's Precison X1.I bought this for the value and because ray tracing isn't widely used yet, so I realized I could live without an RTX GPU. Now that ray tracing is coming to Minecraft, I wish I had the money to buy a RTX 2080 Super or Ti, but they're expensive! Luckily, EVGA has a Step Up program that may let you upgrade your GPU to a new one for a discount. I may do that eventually. I did spend more money and bought the 10 year warranty, which I think is impressive. So far, I love this GPU!"", 'I was concerned about a couple things. Not about the performance of the card per se but more about the quality of thermal paste they used between the GPU and heatsink. And equally as concerning was the quality of heat dissipation the VRMs were getting. Its safe to say my concerns were no more after checking temps in games where they settings were up and my power usage was around 105% (worth noting I did overclock 2115 and 6201mhz on core and memory respectively) In all of my tests 60% fan speed was enough to maintain low 60s in temps and in less power hungry games, was enough to cool the vrms to the point were it was maintaining that 2115 clock across my graph. However, to a surprise to no one, in power hungry games and synthetic work loads, the card would lower voltage and clock speeds to accommodate the higher power draw the VRMs were experiencing. In Furmark at 1440p fullscreen with 8x AA the card was maintaining mid 60s on the GPU but did throttle the clock to between 1980 and 2065mhz. This is a clear sign of VRMs getting too warm and throttling. The only way I was able to maintain a clock over 2000mhz was to put the fans between 90 and 100%. And I must say, if being quite is something you want, you\'ll be fine at the barley noticeable 60% fan speed but if you are looking for best overclock the sound will be present. However, this is 1400p Furmark, there is 0 surprise such an event occurred. But its also worth considering the sound compared to the fact that each fan spins at nearly 4000rpm. And since there is 2, you are moving a lot of air. So with that in mind the amount of noise they make is expected and by no means is ""loud"" if you take their power into consideration. All-in-all. A very good card for the price. With 1080p ultra and 1440p high being completely expected in most games. If you are looking for 4k this card can game at 4k. But the games will have to lack some graphically intensive settings to allow this. However, even with modern less graphically intensive games 4k is achievable at 60fps.', ""Key Point- Thick Card; Shorter Length; Stays Cool; Solid CardAlthough the price is a touch higher than alternative options, I specifically chose this one because the length of the card is shorter while the width (or thickness) of the card is bigger compared to other cards. This works for me because I was not sure if my PC could fit a long card given where my PCI slot was. I did, however, have expansion slots to fit the card (take 3 slots).Gameplay:Plugged it in and ran a few games. For the most part, I was impressed by the boost from my previous GTX 950. Games like Apex I get around 80 FPS on Medium settings and Warframe 100+ frames on almost Max settings. Of course, this varies with other components in your rig (I feel like my card is currently being bottlenecked by my CPU). Because this is a mid-high tier card, you're not going to get maximum possible performance on modern demanding games (and you should not expect to with this price range). I had to mess with the graphics settings for a bit for each game to see what I liked. Sometimes, it is worth sacrificing frames for visual appeal and vice versa. It's up to you to dictate how you want to play your game.That being said if you are looking for 60 FPS at High settings, this will almost always achieve that in whichever game WITH a decent rig.Cooling:As mentioned earlier, this card does have an increased girth and the heatsink does seem much larger in width when compared to other cards. However, this card does stay relatively cooler than I expected. The default temperature before my card begins to throttle is 83 degrees Celsius. An hour of gaming of the mentioned titles and my card never pasts 75 celsius. It usually hovers at 65-70 degrees range.Overall, a good card that does not disappoint."", ""Thermals and CoolingFirstly, the singular fan only gets good airflow over half the heatsink, the rest gets some but not anything notable. even with the holes in the heatsink that is supposed to let air through lets very little through. It is most likely due to the vertical oriented fins blocking a good bit to the rest of the card. if the fins were oriented horizontally then air would get to more of the heatsink. I haven't hit it with something like FurMark, or something that blasts the card with heat, but playing GTA V at 1080p/60 with Very High/Ultra settings (using the most of the card's capabilities) it hits 75C most of the time, still boosting in frequency, but not as good as it could be. the fan spins to nearly 3,000 RPM to keep the card cool resulting in high noise levels. At idle, it's barely only about 3C over ambientGaming performanceGame performance is a huge upgrade from a 1050 Ti, I can play Ghost Recon Wildlands at 1080p with TAA and medium to high settings at 60 FPS, versus my 1050 Ti which had to have minimum settings at 1080p scaled to 80%. As for other games, it has very good framerates/frametimes in Battlefield 4, GTA V, Unturned can run at 4k max, Car Mechanic Simulator, Borderlands TPS and 2, name a game, you can most likely play it at Med-High settings at 1080p 60 fps, unless it's poorly optimized, or very graphically intensive.Price: when I bought the GTX 1660 TI XC Black, it was the only 1660 TI EVGA had on Amazon, and was $280, and at that time GTX 1070s were $400, so it was a no brainer, however with 1070s being about $200-250 I would rather have that.This was written by the person who actually uses said item, rather than my mother, who owns this account."", ""Upgraded from a 1060 6GB EVGA to this 1660 Ti. It's about 30 to 35% faster than the 1060 from my initial testing.Haven't played much with it as yet but after a few benchmarks I can see the card boost really high compared to the advertised boost clocks on EVGA's web site of 1845MHz. In the Superposition benchmark it gets 110fps max 64 min and 77 avg and stays boosted around 1925MHz on average.In Furmark it gets 96fps but will only boost to around 1815MHz.I got the triple slot version with the single fan, if you get this make sure you have 3 PCI slots free. Better yet have 4 slots free so there is not another card blocking airflow to the fan.As far as temps go it is good out of the box with the standard fan profile hitting around 73C in the Superposition benchmark with minimal fan noise. My PC is not right beside me it is about 7-feet away from me hooked up to my TV so I changed the fan profile to aggressive and the temp now stays around 67C in the same benchmark. I can hear the fan spin up but it is still really not noisy. Your mileage might vary as my case is well ventilated with a side intake 140mm fan right over the the PCI slots and there is sound dampening material built into the case an old Fractal Define R3.So from my short time so far with the card I would have to give it 4 out of 5 stars. The card could be cheaper given it is technically the replacement to the 1060 more so than the 2060 is. If the card was 45 to 50% faster then the price would be more understandable, this is more of an Nvidia thing than EVGA's as this card is one of the better price cards with good boost clocks and good cooling."", ""It's a great card for 1080p gaming, and the performance boost in my modest rig makes the upgrade from a perfectly good EVGA 1060 6G OC is noticeable.  I was afraid that the difference wouldn't be worth the cost, but so far I'm liking the results.  I went with EVGA based on the build quality and durability of the last few EVGA cards I've owned, no reason to think this card will be any different.I've got an I5-4400 on an older Dell MB with 16GB DDR3 ram and a 750W PSU shoved in a Coolermaster case.  It's a budget rig, and this budget card lets it run Insurgency: Sandstorm with all the settings maxed at 75 fps.  With the 1060 i'd turn down the settings to get smooth gameplay.  Runs CIV6 like a champ, and the 1060 would chug a little in the late game.Fan noise is the same or less than I had with the 1060.  It does eat up three slots, so make sure there's room or look at a double fan version.Bottom line is that if you've got a modestly good CPU with enough RAM and the required power supply, with the space in the case to support the 3 slot profile, this card will let you crank the settings up to max on anything but the most bleeding edge games in 1080p at under three bills.Budget gamers will like this card."", 'Received product in a fairly timely manner  - just a little slower than the rest of my Prime order.One thing I have to mention to anyone thinking of buying this, or have on on the way, is be VERY careful when installing to not even breath on the cooling fins. They might as well be made of tin foil and I bent a few of them with very very little pressure from my thumb. Every.single.other VC I’ve ever had has some sort of cover or shroud protecting these so wasn’t anticipating this.While I am getting better frames than I did from my GTX 970, I now have been getting some micro-freezes and slight stutter  - which for FPS games, is a real drag. I did a fresh install of my GPU drivers and yesterday used UDD tool to remove all reminiscence and reinstall but the problem is still there. I need to do a fresh OS install soon anyways, so will see how this works out. If this still doesn’t help, then I’ll have to give this card a 2. I have a brand new i7 8700, 16GB of Corsair LPX so there’s no bottleneck here.', ""I've had this card for a good while now and I only have amazing things to say. I ordered 1 for my personal test bench and ended up ordering many more for PC builds. This is the BEST card you can get for the money right now.

I\'ve always been a budget-minded PC gamer, and with that in mind, this card is an absolute blessing. It runs beautifully in a modest Lenovo ThinkCentre M720 tower with 8 GB DDR4 RAM and an Intel Core i5 8400 processor. I haven\'t tested it on any recent AAA releases, but it plays Dark Souls III and Fallout 4 on highest graphical settings without going over 60 degrees C in a tight factory case.There are some things you should consider before purchasing this card, though. You\'ll need a pretty recent motherboard and BIOS setup to run a Turing GPU like this one (I learned this the hard way.) Also, you\'ll need a fairly wide case to hold this card; the PSU pin connector is located on the opposite side of the PCIe slot, so you\'ll need about an extra inch of clearance for the PSU connection and the wires trailing behind it. I barely got this thing to fit in a 6.5""-wide case after moving my HDD to the optical drive bay.Overall, I highly recommend this card for mid-range gaming rigs.', ""Amazing value. I had my gtx 770 for about 6 years and I finally decided that I needed to upgrade. I'm extremely satisfied and pleased with how well I can run games now(very high-ultra on 1080p). Compared to the other brands, the EVGA build quality is very solid, with no cheap and loose components. I am extremely satisfied and would recommend this to anyone who is looking to upgrade their card with a budget below $350.  If you can save the extra $60-80, I would recommend you purchase the rtx 2060.Edit: 2.28.19Please don't be discouraged by the initial rating. Amazon initially posted the wrong image for the 1660ti, alot of people including myself assumed this was the xc ultra which included 2 fans and didn't take up 3 slots. This was an Amazon error and not an issue with the product itself. It's unfortunate that it wasn't corrected immediately but it's unfair to punish the rating of the image low and not the product itself. Regardless, if you have room to accommodate 3 slots and have an ATX mobo then this is a great option. Just make sure you have a compatible mobo to go with the card.""]"

Das Fractal Vector RS Blackout Dark TG Gehäuse entspricht nicht nur meinen Erwartungen, sondern es hat auch auf einer Seite getempertes Glas und die Möglichkeit, eine Grafikkarte vertikal einzubauen. Ergo. musste ich mir ein passendes Kabel für den vertikalen Einbau der Grafikkarte suchen. Das ging aber nicht gleich von heute auf morgen, denn ich musste nun erstmal mit dem Studium zum Einbau einer vertikalen Grafikkarte beginnen.Nachdem ich mit diesem Studium fertig war, wusste ich genau, was ich wollte. Laut meinen Messungen und Berechnungen, benötigte ich ein PCIE 3.0 16x Riser Cable mit einer Länge von 30 cm. Davon gibt es auch mehr als nur reichlich und so musste ich die ausgesuchten Kabel eingrenzen. Zum Schluss blieb das ""LINKUP {30 cm} PCIE 3.0 16x Riser Cable Super Abgeschirmt Twinaxial PCI Express Steigleitung Kabel Portverlängerungs-Platte 2020 Rev | 90 Grad Buchse"" übrig und wurde dann auch bei Amazon gekauft.Dank Amazon, war dieses Kabel schneller hier als das neue Computergehäuse. Beim  Fractal Vector RS Blackout Dark TG Gehäuse, sind die Bohrungen für den vertikalen Einbau einer Grafikkarte bereits vorgegeben. Die benötigten Abstandshalter sind von der Höhe her die selben, wie sie auch im Gehäuse für das Mainboard genutzt werden. Somit wurde de Einbau des PCIE 3.0 16x Riser Kabels zum Kinderspiel. Auch die 30 cm Länge, erwiesen sich als perfekt berechnet.Nachdem der Computer nach seinem Umzug in das neue Gehäuse wieder komplett zusammen geschraubt war, kam de spannende Moment.

I was disappointed to see that I was getting constant BSODs after booting with the riser cable recently installed. Couldn\'t even load the desktop in some cases.I set the primary PCI-E lane to use x16 Gen 3 (PCI-E 3.0) and sure enough it booted just fine after that. So even though the packaging material says it\'s ""4.0 Ready"" it is sadly not. My BIOS was set to use ""AUTO"" as the PCI-E Generation spec, so it was likely defaulting to 4.0 and crashing on boot.I decided to give the Extreme Gaming edition riser cable a try even though it only comes in 30CM at the minimum, but hopefully it will function at PCI-E 4.0 standards. I will update this review once I know if the ""Extreme Gaming"" version of these riser cables will work for PCI-E 4.0UPDATE: I got the 30cm (Right Angle) Extreme Gaming version of the cable and while, yes, I am able to boot up with PCI-E 4.0 mode enabled (BIOS set to ""AUTO"") I got fairly frequent Blue Screens of Death with ""Video TDR Failure (atikmpag.sys)"" crashes. I decided to just run the PCI-E_x16_1 lane in my BIOS at 3.0 to prevent the crashes, but it just seems like these LINKUP available riser cables won\'t work for my motherboard + GPU combo.The cables work well, and seem to be well made, and I don\'t have issues running at PCI-E 3.0 but they are certainly not guaranteed to work with PCI-E 4.0 in any and all scenarios.**UPDATE**I was notified about an updated riser cable from LINKUP called the ""Ultra PCIe 4.0"" Riser Cable and quickly ordered a 20cm right angle version of the new cable directly from LINKUP to give it a try, and to my delight it\'s working great with PCIe 4.0 x16 so far! I ran several benchmarks (3DMark PCI Express Feature Test, Time Spy, Fire Strike, etc.) and tests and have gamed quite a bit with it installed and my PCIe lane set back to ""auto"" and haven\'t seen any issues or BSODs so far using this new Ultra PCIe 4.0 riser cable. I\'ve confirmed with GPU-Z that the PCIe mode is entering 4.0 while gaming or a video rendering load is detected. LINKUP will launch their true PCIe 4.0 riser cables in March, 2020 on Amazon.

This is my bootable drive containing Windows 10 Version 1809. I mounted the hard disk almost the full length of the 40 cm (right angled slot) riser I bought away from my dual Nvidia Titan RTXs. The data strap was folded twice (not excessive angles) and the slots in the riser cable tied gently to prevent it touching the two GPUs.While the disk was still detected by the BIOS; the system would not boot. Windows kept giving error messages instead of booting from the disk. The fact that Windows was giving these issues means the disk was readable. I then removed the riser and placed the SSD back in the motherboards x4 slot and it booted first time and continues to work fine.In short this may work on GPUs (graphics cards) and sound cards but may not be suitable for hard drives. I have read that GPUs will tolerate some data loss e.g. a few missed frames in a game or a sound card may crackle/distort but a hard disk needs seamless data transfer (I may be wrong but hard disks don't appear to feature error correction from their cables/interface but only in their data storage on the solid state/magnetic media) and may be this is why even with a high quality and well made cable; my use case just wouldn't work.I only deducted 1 star since I feel the product is of high quality and would have been perfect for me if I was re-locating a device other than a hard disk. Your mileage may vary. Thanks for reading."", ""I'm currently using a Thermaltake Riser with my Gen 4 AMD motherboard for my GPU.

Once I connected this riser, it said PCIE 3.0 @ PCIE 3.0, which suggested that the motherboard was detecting everything ok.That wasn't the case. After many crashes, I realised I had to change an additional setting in the bios which was for PCIE Slots. Once I changed that from Auto to Gen 3, I was good to go.Just be sure to change your PCIE Slots to Gen 3.

Let me explain why.I bought this used, and first off, the price for it Used - Very Good was absolutely absurd. This was shipped by Amazon and sold by Amazon Warehouse (Warehouse Deals).The price of it used, which was $412.76, was more expensive than buying it new from another retailer (I believe if I mentioned the retailer, this review will get delete). Also, the MSRP for this item from launch was still cheaper than this... and this was Amazon Warehouse that was selling this. When did Amazon become scalpers too (said without proof, please don\'t delete this review).Secondly, I have a dual monitor setup. One of the ports doesn\'t work. Whoever did the check on this at the Amazon Warehouse definitely was only looking at the device from the outside and didn\'t actually test it, which is ridiculous because because this is an electronic device which is almost always going to need a check on it\'s functioning. Which leads me to...Third, this card just doesn\'t work the way it\'s supposed to. That is, the VRAM exceeds it\'s capacity apparently, the GPU utilization is only 0-5% while in game, and it shows no GPU RAM is being used but all my system RAM is being used. The GPU is clocking at more than it\'s OC Boost stats, while not even being over clocked... this is all using MSI\'s Afterburner program to monitor the GPU.This entire GPU is a complete bust and messed me over because I ended up selling my GTX 970 because I assumed something sold and shipped by Amazon Warehouse/Amazon would be checked for quality. There was very little of a quality check and now I\'m stuck with a GPU that does work, but will need replaced to ensure I don\'t cook over anything else on my PC.Absolutely disgusted in Amazon for selling this as Used - Very Good, let alone for it\'s price it was set to. Even if it was ""Used - Very Good"", why am I paying more for a used card than I would if I bought the exact same card brand new.In all honesty though, Amazon has been helpful and have issued me a partial refund to compensate, but when I return this card whenever (if) I can find a new card, that credit will be gone (as it was applied to the order, so when I return it I\'ll just get the rest of the order).

I can run games like Resident Evil 2, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Destiny 2, Soul Calibur VI all run at 1080p/60fps. With some games like RE2, D2 and SCVI, I can downsample from higher resolution (mainly 2560x1440px) and still maintain 60fps on high settings. I’ve yet to test it with other games, but it handles those ones well. Temperatures idle around low to mid 30’s  and during gaming ranges from 45°C to 65°C depending on the game.

Great build and quality.  DO NOT INSTALL Mystic light! It is the only downfall to the whole line. But compared to the 2060 super (I have one of them as well) the jump in price is not noticeable for the common 1080p gamer. There are not many games to utilize the new features in the rtx line and unless you just have to have it. With 100$ jump you are not going to tell a difference.

In AMD\'s corner, at the same price point is the RX 590... this card is 25% faster than a RX 590 and uses half the power consumption, running cooler, quieter and playing games better than the RX 590.Nvidia has also enabled AMD Freesync monitor support in their GeForce drivers... and it can be any Freesync monitor, not just one on their shortlist.

Certainly there are faster cards out there, but you need to compare how much you are spending for the performance you are getting... the 1660Ti is a great card for the performance at this price point.*Late 2019 update: my initial review was written launch week of the 1660Ti (Feb 2019)... as with anything in the tech industry, things change as time marches on. While this card is still an awesome card, and I have ZERO regrets having purchased it and enjoy it every day, if you\'re looking for a new GPU at the end of 2019 under $300, the only real competition to the 1660Ti is NVidia\'s own competition... the recently released 1660 Super. The 1660 Super\'s performance is nearly identical to the 1660Ti across the board... usually the 1660Ti will just barely edge-out the 1660 Super by a frame or two here or there, so the 1660Ti is still technically faster than the 1660 Super, but not anything that anyone would notice (literally only one or two FPS in any game)... the difference is the 1660 Super is cheaper than the 1660Ti... so you can save a good chunk of change and ALMOST get the exact same performance of a 1660Ti if you pick up a 1660 Super.

I\'d sell my old card for massive profit, but then i\'d have no video card! After two years of great service, I was considering a 30-series GeForce card (i\'ve updated my MB/CPU to a 10th Gen i7-10700F), but it\'s either out of stock or crazy overpriced as of this posting, so i\'ll stick with my 1660Ti... still a solid card in 2021... glad I had a good card for a decent price before the craziness of 2021 hit.', 'Until this day this Geforce 1660Ti is giving me no reason to buy any new graphics cards! Imean i get a decent 200+ FPS playing fortnite.', 'Awesome card for 1080p game play.', ""Bought this from Amazon when my previous MSI 780 ti bricked. Would have preferred another brand since the previous did stop working, after all, but this one was available next day and production time yada yada. Arrived 14 hours later at 2:30 pm. Bit of a struggle for some reason to get the port end into the side slots but it did go in.Card is, if anything, more compact than the previous 780 ti,  and uses less power, with a better overall finish. There's a back plate to cover the fish and chips on the circuit board. Fans are OK noise wise but not the quietest (Zotac, for example, quieter under load).I was dubious about the memory bandwidth and shaders, but, in fact, no worries, the newer design more than compensates. Playback and export in Premiere only uses 60-70 percent of the card, even with 4K clips with a ton of filters, so this card is fine for most people. You can step up to the 20 series but it is an incremental gain.Using neat video, interestingly, the optimum frame rate uses *only* the GPU! That frees up the CPU. Getting over 6fps render in Neat video with 4K clips using GPU only. Not great, but better than what I had before. The 6GB ram seems OK for 4K, I doubt it will handle 8k but whatever. Has display ports and HDMI 2.0MSI terminology for the flavors of these cards is confusing, and *Ventus* sounds like a coffee term, and you may have to install the USB C driver even if there is no port. Still, a solid card."", ""So, Carefully I took my time standing on a piece of metal and touching the metal parts to keep from esd and unplugged and disconnected the wires, also uninstall the old graphics card drives before I took my old gpu out. So after all that I installed the new one carefully taking my time after seeing how others did it online on youtube and was able to do this myself pretty easily. After I installed it and install the drives from online that I had download from nivida website beforehand, I installed them and that's it, it worked. Nothing more needed to be down. Just had to make sure i didn't accidentally unplug anything on the motherboard and make sure nothing was in the way of the fans. I keep my wires nice and tidy so its not one big mess, but other then that, I don't think I could of done this any better. Everything works, didn't get a bad gpu as far as I can tell and i'm pretty content with it. Thank you, I look forward to my next upgrade in the future... Although there was one strange annoyance I had with it and had discovered what it was online, something about a c-port drive that couldn't be updated because I think I was suppose to install some sort of virtual drives for a vr head set even though I don't own or use one. Anyways I found out what it was on reddit and was mention that it was okay to disable it since it wouldn't do any harm, so I did and haven't had any troubles since. So Just a heads up if your buying this or a higher end graphics card. Also I held down the power button for 60 sec's when making sure there was no more electricity after I had unplugged everything(to avoid esd)."", ""Très bonne carte, la précédente a rendu l'âme en plantant mon ordinateur 4 fois pendant un jeu.Celle-ci a peine installé, j'ai pu reprendre mes partie en profitant de meilleurs rendu graphiques.Très bonne carte pour mon utilisation modéré"", ""This is my first Nvidia GPU and  it has been a revelation. I stepped up to this after running a Crossfire configuration of 2 AMD R9 290. From 2014. So I have no bias one way or the other. With my setup of a Ryzen 5 3600, an OS SSD and a games-only SSD, this GPU and 16G RAM, I can play anything I have. Doom '16 gives me 110 fps at 1080p and 80 fps at 1440p. Even at full 4k I get about 50 fps so it's quite playable and that is at max settings. Fallout 4 is 60fps at 1080p and 1440p, max settings. Metro:Exodus- 70fps at 1080p, 55 fps at 1440p, max settings. Metro:Exodus is probably the game I have that most pushes this GPU and it still does well. It will play 4k but at 30fps, less sometimes. I consider that unplayable but others might not. The fans are quiet and the size is great. I recently moved to a mid size case in the Corsair ICUE 220t RGB which is a fairly compact case for being mid-size. The GPU fits it perfectly with a little room to spare. I think this GPU will last me a good long while until I step up to a true 4k/ray tracing big boy. For now, this card is a bargain for the price ($264 is what I paid in 11/2019)."", ""I'm happy with it, mostly.It easily demolishes even the newest, prettiest games on maximum/ultra graphical settings at 1080p. And for the most part, it can do 1440p (which is what I run my games at) with a minimum of 60 FPS just fine. However, do expect certain new AAA games or simply poorly-optimized games (or even indie games that use Unreal Engine 4 and go crazy with the engine's graphical capabilities) to sometimes dip to around 55 or even down to 50 FPS occasionally at this resolution. Sometimes even down to 40, which I find happens in effects- and especially shadow-heavy games. Although, I have never witnessed any game I've thrown at it turn into a slideshow yet.It is (or was?) a mid-tier, bang-for-your-buck card at the time I bought it, so it's hard to complain about it. If you decide to get it, be prepared to turn down shadows from High down to Medium or even Low in your graphically-intense games if you want to consistently hit 60 FPS in the prettiest games out there.To summarize, this is a 1080p card, but it gets away with 1440p in many games too."", ""I bought this 01/2020 for VR (and because it allowed me to not replace my PSU, this card only requires 450w PSU), I needed it for Half Life Alyx, and it cost about $230. Now as I write this in 12/2020 they want $550. What the heck happened/is happening, scalpers? But why?? This card suits my needs, it has good performance for mid to upper mid games, and *was* the affordable card before moving into the RTX 20-- cards. Do not pay a hair above $250 for this card, it good but not worth 500+. MSI made a good product with this one, but again at this time this card is on its way out, now that we're into the RTX 30-- series. When doing VR it gets the fans moving but not to bad or loud or annoying. I hope to get another year or so from this card, there have been no hiccups, easy plug and play and install the drivers.-Dell Inspiron 5680-460w psu-16G RAM"", ""This Graphics card is the product of capitalism at its finest. In an all-out attempt to reclaim considerable market share from AMD, Nvidia releases a mid-range graphics card that is anything but. I came from an MSI GTX 1060 6GB that I had overclocked with MSI afterburner, so I wasn't sure if this was going to offer the performance that would justify the upgrade cost. After just one Benchmark, all my worries were put to rest. This card is an absolute Powerhouse and is only about two-thirds of the size of my 1060.  It offers performance that at times beats a 1070, and has incredible overclock potential. My GTX 1060 I could overclock the memory speed by about 450 megahertz. The 1660 I have at the maximum overclock MSI afterburner will allow of 1500 megahertz for a total clock speed of 7500 megahertz for video RAM. The core clock can handle what appears to be about 120mhz overclock.  I have yet to find a game that makes it fall below 30 frames per second on 4K resolution, with all Graphics settings maxed out.  This card also handles virtual reality very well and I would highly recommend for anybody looking to have a cost-effective VR system. You can expect about a 50% jump in performance over a GTX 1060, sometimes more sometimes less depending on the game. It appears that newer games see more of a performance increase than older ones but still a considerable increase no matter what game. I am beyond happy with my purchase and would absolutely do it again and recommend anybody who's on the fence about upgrading from a 1060, to do it""]"

I only heard a little bit during really hard stress test with MSI afterburner.If you only have about 330 bucks to spend go with the 1660 ti over the RX 590/RX vega 56.

If I run into any issues I will update this review."", 'I will never be buying any electronic from Amazon Warehouse and I highly recommend others to be cautious. Let me explain why.I bought this used, and first off, the price for it Used - Very Good was absolutely absurd. This was shipped by Amazon and sold by Amazon Warehouse (Warehouse Deals).The price of it used, which was $412.76, was more expensive than buying it new from another retailer (I believe if I mentioned the retailer, this review will get delete). Also, the MSRP for this item from launch was still cheaper than this... and this was Amazon Warehouse that was selling this. When did Amazon become scalpers too (said without proof, please don\'t delete this review).Secondly, I have a dual monitor setup. One of the ports doesn\'t work. Whoever did the check on this at the Amazon Warehouse definitely was only looking at the device from the outside and didn\'t actually test it, which is ridiculous because because this is an electronic device which is almost always going to need a check on it\'s functioning. Which leads me to...Third, this card just doesn\'t work the way it\'s supposed to. That is, the VRAM exceeds it\'s capacity apparently, the GPU utilization is only 0-5% while in game, and it shows no GPU RAM is being used but all my system RAM is being used. The GPU is clocking at more than it\'s OC Boost stats, while not even being over clocked... this is all using MSI\'s Afterburner program to monitor the GPU.This entire GPU is a complete bust and messed me over because I ended up selling my GTX 970 because I assumed something sold and shipped by Amazon Warehouse/Amazon would be checked for quality. There was very little of a quality check and now I\'m stuck with a GPU that does work, but will need replaced to ensure I don\'t cook over anything else on my PC.Absolutely disgusted in Amazon for selling this as Used - Very Good, let alone for it\'s price it was set to. Even if it was ""Used - Very Good"", why am I paying more for a used card than I would if I bought the exact same card brand new.In all honesty though, Amazon has been helpful and have issued me a partial refund to compensate, but when I return this card whenever (if) I can find a new card, that credit will be gone (as it was applied to the order, so when I return it I\'ll just get the rest of the order). I still am grateful that they sent me a partial refund, but I wish I never got this card.', 'I still play on 1080p monitor, and this card performs well at that resolution. I went this GPU because the RTX cards (particularly the RTX 2060) were a bit too expensive — this one sufficed. I can run games like Resident Evil 2, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Destiny 2, Soul Calibur VI all run at 1080p/60fps. With some games like RE2, D2 and SCVI, I can downsample from higher resolution (mainly 2560x1440px) and still maintain 60fps on high settings. I’ve yet to test it with other games, but it handles those ones well. Temperatures idle around low to mid 30’s  and during gaming ranges from 45°C to 65°C depending on the game. I have no complaints about fan noise — I find it’s pretty good. I’ve had much louder GPU’s in the past.', 'Great card for the price. No need to go to the rtx series. There are cheaper 1660 ti cards any of them will do the job for less. This is a premium card and I have had good luck with  msi products so stuck with it. I also like the look and feel of the card. Great build and quality.  DO NOT INSTALL Mystic light! It is the only downfall to the whole line. But compared to the 2060 super (I have one of them as well) the jump in price is not noticeable for the common 1080p gamer. There are not many games to utilize the new features in the rtx line and unless you just have to have it. With 100$ jump you are not going to tell a difference. The 1660ti card avg 100 to 140 FPS in most titles on high settings. Hope this helps', ""This was my third video card installed because the prior ones were so noisy.  This gets 5 stars alone just because it's smart enough to only use the fan when the temperature requires it and it's significantly quieter than others.  There are plenty of better video cards out there, but this is the perfect solution for anyone with a Dell XPS and doesn't want to mess around with also upgrading the power supply.  This is as simple as getting a 6-to-8 pin adapter ($7 on AMZ), for the PCIe plug in and you're good to go.

After two years of great service, I was considering a 30-series GeForce card (i\'ve updated my MB/CPU to a 10th Gen i7-10700F), but it\'s either out of stock or crazy overpriced as of this posting, so i\'ll stick with my 1660Ti... still a solid card in 2021... glad I had a good card for a decent price before the craziness of 2021 hit.', 'Until this day this Geforce 1660Ti is giving me no reason to buy any new graphics cards! Imean i get a decent 200+ FPS playing fortnite.', 'Awesome card for 1080p game play.', ""Bought this from Amazon when my previous MSI 780 ti bricked. Would have preferred another brand since the previous did stop working, after all, but this one was available next day and production time yada yada. Arrived 14 hours later at 2:30 pm. Bit of a struggle for some reason to get the port end into the side slots but it did go in.Card is, if anything, more compact than the previous 780 ti,  and uses less power, with a better overall finish. There's a back plate to cover the fish and chips on the circuit board. Fans are OK noise wise but not the quietest (Zotac, for example, quieter under load).I was dubious about the memory bandwidth and shaders, but, in fact, no worries, the newer design more than compensates. Playback and export in Premiere only uses 60-70 percent of the card, even with 4K clips with a ton of filters, so this card is fine for most people. You can step up to the 20 series but it is an incremental gain.Using neat video, interestingly, the optimum frame rate uses *only* the GPU! That frees up the CPU. Getting over 6fps render in Neat video with 4K clips using GPU only. Not great, but better than what I had before. The 6GB ram seems OK for 4K, I doubt it will handle 8k but whatever. Has display ports and HDMI 2.0MSI terminology for the flavors of these cards is confusing, and *Ventus* sounds like a coffee term, and you may have to install the USB C driver even if there is no port. Still, a solid card."", ""So, Carefully I took my time standing on a piece of metal and touching the metal parts to keep from esd and unplugged and disconnected the wires, also uninstall the old graphics card drives before I took my old gpu out. So after all that I installed the new one carefully taking my time after seeing how others did it online on youtube and was able to do this myself pretty easily. After I installed it and install the drives from online that I had download from nivida website beforehand, I installed them and that's it, it worked. Nothing more needed to be down. Just had to make sure i didn't accidentally unplug anything on the motherboard and make sure nothing was in the way of the fans. I keep my wires nice and tidy so its not one big mess, but other then that, I don't think I could of done this any better. Everything works, didn't get a bad gpu as far as I can tell and i'm pretty content with it. Thank you, I look forward to my next upgrade in the future... Although there was one strange annoyance I had with it and had discovered what it was online, something about a c-port drive that couldn't be updated because I think I was suppose to install some sort of virtual drives for a vr head set even though I don't own or use one. Anyways I found out what it was on reddit and was mention that it was okay to disable it since it wouldn't do any harm, so I did and haven't had any troubles since. So Just a heads up if your buying this or a higher end graphics card. Also I held down the power button for 60 sec's when making sure there was no more electricity after I had unplugged everything(to avoid esd)."", ""Très bonne carte, la précédente a rendu l'âme en plantant mon ordinateur 4 fois pendant un jeu.Celle-ci a peine installé, j'ai pu reprendre mes partie en profitant de meilleurs rendu graphiques.Très bonne carte pour mon utilisation modéré"", ""This is my first Nvidia GPU and  it has been a revelation. I stepped up to this after running a Crossfire configuration of 2 AMD R9 290. From 2014. So I have no bias one way or the other. With my setup of a Ryzen 5 3600, an OS SSD and a games-only SSD, this GPU and 16G RAM, I can play anything I have. Doom '16 gives me 110 fps at 1080p and 80 fps at 1440p. Even at full 4k I get about 50 fps so it's quite playable and that is at max settings. Fallout 4 is 60fps at 1080p and 1440p, max settings. Metro:Exodus- 70fps at 1080p, 55 fps at 1440p, max settings. Metro:Exodus is probably the game I have that most pushes this GPU and it still does well. It will play 4k but at 30fps, less sometimes. I consider that unplayable but others might not. The fans are quiet and the size is great. I recently moved to a mid size case in the Corsair ICUE 220t RGB which is a fairly compact case for being mid-size. The GPU fits it perfectly with a little room to spare. I think this GPU will last me a good long while until I step up to a true 4k/ray tracing big boy.

And for the most part, it can do 1440p (which is what I run my games at) with a minimum of 60 FPS just fine. However, do expect certain new AAA games or simply poorly-optimized games (or even indie games that use Unreal Engine 4 and go crazy with the engine's graphical capabilities) to sometimes dip to around 55 or even down to 50 FPS occasionally at this resolution. Sometimes even down to 40, which I find happens in effects- and especially shadow-heavy games. Although, I have never witnessed any game I've thrown at it turn into a slideshow yet.It is (or was?) a mid-tier, bang-for-your-buck card at the time I bought it, so it's hard to complain about it. If you decide to get it, be prepared to turn down shadows from High down to Medium or even Low in your graphically-intense games if you want to consistently hit 60 FPS in the prettiest games out there.To summarize, this is a 1080p card, but it gets away with 1440p in many games too."", ""I bought this 01/2020 for VR (and because it allowed me to not replace my PSU, this card only requires 450w PSU), I needed it for Half Life Alyx, and it cost about $230. Now as I write this in 12/2020 they want $550. What the heck happened/is happening, scalpers? But why?? This card suits my needs, it has good performance for mid to upper mid games, and *was* the affordable card before moving into the RTX 20-- cards. Do not pay a hair above $250 for this card, it good but not worth 500+. MSI made a good product with this one, but again at this time this card is on its way out, now that we're into the RTX 30-- series.

In an all-out attempt to reclaim considerable market share from AMD, Nvidia releases a mid-range graphics card that is anything but. I came from an MSI GTX 1060 6GB that I had overclocked with MSI afterburner, so I wasn't sure if this was going to offer the performance that would justify the upgrade cost. After just one Benchmark, all my worries were put to rest. This card is an absolute Powerhouse and is only about two-thirds of the size of my 1060.  It offers performance that at times beats a 1070, and has incredible overclock potential. My GTX 1060 I could overclock the memory speed by about 450 megahertz. The 1660 I have at the maximum overclock MSI afterburner will allow of 1500 megahertz for a total clock speed of 7500 megahertz for video RAM. The core clock can handle what appears to be about 120mhz overclock.  I have yet to find a game that makes it fall below 30 frames per second on 4K resolution, with all Graphics settings maxed out.  This card also handles virtual reality very well and I would highly recommend for anybody looking to have a cost-effective VR system. You can expect about a 50% jump in performance over a GTX 1060, sometimes more sometimes less depending on the game. It appears that newer games see more of a performance increase than older ones but still a considerable increase no matter what game. I am beyond happy with my purchase and would absolutely do it again and recommend anybody who's on the fence about upgrading from a 1060, to do it""]"

If a 590 is just an overclocked 580, and the 580 is just a retread of the 480, how can the 590 possibly be a good deal?  Well, easy... if you get the 590 for the right price, and only need a 1080/1440p-type card, you could be in luck.  I've noticed that all video cards are fluctuating wildly in price right now, but if you can get this in the 165-185 range, this is a really great deal.  While it's priced similarly to the 5500XT and 1650 Super, the 590 is faster in both compute and 1080p (and about tied at 1440p).  About the only thing you may regret is the power usage, which is higher than more modern cards.  The heat situation, though, isn't a problem with the chunky AIB cooler.  I even managed a pretty significant overclock (using just the AMD-based overclocking), without having my card sound like a hair dryer.The bottom line is that this card is part of a market segment that won't exist for much longer.  APUs are going to chew up the low-end dGPU segment, and high-end dGPUs are going to remain very expensive.  When the new Navi cards fill up the channel, I'm fairly certain that the low end will go to the Vega cards, and the Polaris cards will go away.  In the meantime, this is a great option for fast 1080p (or usable 1440p).  Conditionally recommended."", 'Die Karte ist preiswert, das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ist gut. Die Karte wird nicht auf dem neuesten Stand sein, dafür muss man dann halt mindestens 400 € hinlegen. Bei unter der Hälfte darf man keine Wunderdinge erwarten.Ich spiele meine Spiele auf der Playstation.

Gute Karten verbrauchen viel Strom.', 'The Radeon RX590 is one of the best GPU chipsets for price/performance ratio. It won\'t outperform the higher end graphics cards, but for 1080p games it will lock in consistently at 60-70fps or better, which is more than adequate for smooth, crisp gaming. The RX590 evolved from the RX480, which then became the RX580. The RX590, compared to the RX480/580, went to a smaller die size and has a higher clock speed. On average the performance boost is 10% compared to the RX580. The downside - the RX590 draws more power and generates more heat. That being said, the RX590 is a great value in the sub-$200 range.This card is a monster, it\'s called the ""FatBoy"" for a reason. Make sure you have room in your case for it, as well as adequate cooling. At 100% utilization during benchmarking, this GPU will hit temps around 80-82C IF you don\'t use the AMD Radeon software to manually tune your fan. These temps are borderline as they will cause the GPU to throttle/shut down and potentially cause a system crash. Make sure you go into your AMD Radeon Settings - either Wattman (if you\'re using older drivers) or if you\'re using the 2020 Adrenalin drivers, go into ""Performance"", then select ""Tuning"". Manually tune your fan, and make sure that fan speed comes up to over 75-85% when your GPU is above 50-55C. At higher temps above 65-70C, you want that fan to run at 100%. It might be audible, but it will absolutely save your GPU from overheating and throttling down (which will crash your system and potentially reduce the life of the GPU). Once the fan is properly tuned to ramp up when the GPU is above 50C, run benchmarks (3DMark is a good one) and use the Radeon Metrics Overlay to ensure your GPU temperature stays below (ideally) 70-75C. With the fan cranking, the GPU core should stay well below 75C, ensuring that other components on the card don\'t exceed their rated temps. Many reviewers have given this card bad reviews and mention overheating - chances are these reviewers never bothered to tune their fan control within the AMD Radeon settings.I mounted this card using a PCIe riser cable to keep it away from my CPU, and had to relocate a couple of my HDD\'s to ensure it had adequate clearance.Overall, the XFX is a great graphics card at a lower cost than other brands using the identical RX590 chip set. The ""Core"" edition card does not have any RGB effects, so if you\'re looking for a card with RGB lighting, this one isn\'t it.*** The XFX RX590 Fatboy is a DUAL BIOS card. By default, the card is set to run in ""stealth"" or ""quiet"" mode from the factory. There is a small switch next to the power connector - flip this switch to change to the ""Performance"" BIOS. This will run the card some 28-30C cooler at max load because the fan settings within this BIOS are much more aggressive. You can also make these adjustments in Wattman or within the Radeon Adrenalin 2020 settings by ramping your fan up as temps increase. I recommend throwing the switch in ""performance"" mode because wattman and fan tuning settings can be reset to default after a system crash. You\'ll know you\'re in the ""Performance"" mode BIOS because the GPU fans will come on as soon as your system is powered on (switch position is farthest from the power connectors...by default the BIOS switch is closest to the power connectors).', ""LA RX590 8 GB di XFX si è dimostrata una vera e propria bestia, in tutti i sensi.L'ho acquistata per €199 in offerta su amazon, erano le ultime, e nonostante - per scelta personale - avevo deciso di non acquistare più schede video da Gaming, quando mi sono imbattuto nella RX590, a quel prezzo, ho dovuto acquistarla per forza.Gli 8 GB di GDDR5 sono la ciliegina sulla torta di questa GPU che sprigiona potenza e mantiene basse temperature. Insieme alla RX590 vengono regalati 3 Mesi di XBOX Live e 1 gioco a scelta tra: Borderlands 3 e Ghost Recon Break Point ( dovete inviare una comunicazione al Venditore che tra le altre cose è stato gentilissimo).Ho effettuato 2 tipologie di Test per capire appieno la potenza di questa GPU.Nel primo caso, ho provato a Minare Monero utilizzando Minergate, e mi ha piacevolmente stupito, regalandomi cifre davvero interessanti, parliamo di valori superiori ai 600 H/s. ( no overclock )Il test in gaming invece l'ho effettuato prima con Far Cry 5 New Dawn, ho impostato  tutto ad ultra e non è riuscito comuqnue a saturare la potenza di calcolo della Scheda. Gli FPS ( con V-Sync e Free Sync attivi ) non è mai sceso sotto i 60.Il secondo gioco che ho usato per effettuare un test è proprio Ghost Recon, qui sfortunatamente ho dovuto giocare un po' con i settings grafici, impostando tutto su Alto, e alcuni effetti su Ultra. Nonostante il 3D Load ( voce del Task Manager ) fosse sempre vicino al 95/100%  il gameplay è sempre stato super-fluido e i frame non sono mai scesi al di sotto dei 50 FPS.Con un Load del genere e sessioni di gioco intensive la scheda video avrebbe dovuto scaldarsi mostruosamente, tuttavia impostando ( via speed fan ) le 2 Ventole al 100%, nonostante un così alto Load la temperatura di lavoro si aggirava intorno ai 50/55 gradi.Per via degli impegni lavorativi ho sempre meno tempo per poter giocare, tuttavia lavorando con 2 Schermi questa scheda svolge un lavoro più che egregio. Se poi calcoliamo anche il prezzo al quale viene venduta allora è un Acquisto super intelligente, che almeno per me durerà altri 3/4 anni."", ""Ho acquistato questa scheda video dal warehouse con un problema non segnalato sulla plancia con le uscite HDMI e DVI della scheda che mi ha creato qualche problema sul montaggio, ma nulla di tragico.La scheda si presenta, a parte il difetto, apparentemente come nuova con cavi sigillati e perfino i tappi sulle porte HDMI tranne una... nessun segno di usura o graffio... Io penso sia nuova con solo quel difetto sulle porte!!Il montaggio è molto semplice, ricordatevi solamente di togliere il blocco PCI su cui inserirete la scheda video e 2 copri slot sul retro del case. Per l'alimentazione troverete due cavetti da collegare a loro volta ai cavi dell'alimentatore: impossibile sbagliarsi.In game, con la mia configurazione che vi lascerò in fondo, è eccezionale! In Full HD con dettagli ultra non ha nessun problema a tenere saldamente i 60fps  anche con giochi come Star Wars jedi: fallen order con dettagli in epico.I problemi di questa scheda video sono la rumorosità e i consumi.Il rumore delle ventole, quando sale la temperatura, è davvero forte. D'obbligo le cuffie! I consumi vanno dai 140W ai 180W con temperature intorno ai 75/80° nel gioco con cui ho testato.Io ho acquistato questa scheda con un forte sconto (153€), ma onestamente non so se la consiglierei a prezzo pieno per via del rumore e dei consumi appunto, considerando che, aggiungendo una trentina di euro al prezzo pieno, trovereste sicuramente alternative con le stesse caratteristiche ma senza quei difetti.Build:MB: B450 Aorus proCPU: Ryzen 5 3400GRAM: 16Gb 3000 MHzPSU 500W Riotoro (le mie componenti sommate per eccesso assorbono circa 400W)Monitor Full HD 75Hz"", ""La scheda video comprata per 199€ risulta essere la versione top della serie RX 5xx di AMD con ben 8GB di DDR5. Questa è la versione FatBoy di XFX ed è leggermente più spessa perché il telaio del dissipatore copre anche i circuiti sul retro della scheda.Nella confezione ho trovato due cavetti che nel mio caso non mi sono serviti per nulla e un disco per i driver (non l'ho usato perché basta scaricarli dal sito web ufficiale AMD più aggiornati).La scheda ha due ventole che non si sentono assolutamente per un uso home office e continuano ad essere silenziose anche se si gioca.Le cose possono cambiare quando i video giochi diventano più impegnativi e pesanti. La scheda inizia a riscaldare parecchio e nel mio case ha raggiunto tranquillamente gli 84°C e le ventole iniziano a farsi sentire ma comunque rimangono accettabili.Pro- Top di gamma serie RX- 8GB di vram- buona costruzione nell'insiemeContro- A prestazioni elevate un po' rumorosa e alte temperature- Scarna dotazione software (niente giochi in bundle)- Scarna dotazione hardware (2 cavetti a mio avviso poco utili)Consiglio di controllare il case se ci entra perché è lunga circa 27cm e quindi almeno 28/30cm di spazio per l'installazione. Meglio installare nel case delle ventole più grandi per avere la giusta areazione e soprattutto su panello laterale del case se avete possibilità.I giochi vanno fluidi e senza problemi. Può essere paragonata quasi a una nvidia 2060 ma ovviamente non ha il supporto alle nuove RTX e ha una potenza inferiore (10%-20%) ma ovviamente compensa con il costo della scheda.Quindi per chi vuole fare un upgrade la consiglio benissimo e per i prossimi 5 anni sta tranquillo in attesa di evoluzioni ini campo grafico."", ""*Update 3*I was a little upset on update 2.

What I can say about this card is that so far it has met all of my expectations.My first card that I purchased for my current computer was an rtx 2060 black from EVGA.  I didn't do any research before I purchased it, I just saw it had a fair price and claimed to operate rather silently.  It didn't.  It was loud, and warm, resulting in dropped clocks (76 degrees during heavy load).  This was probably a result of the one fan design, despite the rather large heat sink.  For some people, the loud fans probably wouldn't be an issue, but with nearly everything else silent on my rig I found it to be annoying.  It performed okay, it was just too loud, and from what I have seen a lot of the rtx 2060s run pretty warm resulting in increased fan use (noise).  I was even considering liquid cooling the 2060 just to get temps, and therefore noise, down, but decided to instead return the card and get a card with good thermals to begin with.Having not been satisfied, I checked reviews for the different 2070 models.  After seeing that this was a no-frills card that managed to keep rather low temps, I was on board.  At first, after installing, I was worried when I saw it idling at around 48 to 50 degrees, and I thought that furmark would push it up to 90.  Nope, this gpu has fans that are completely off at idle, which is why it runs a little warmer than normal.  This means no noise at all from the gpu… and you can even set a custom fan curve to have it run cool at idle if you wish.  Idle temps don't really bother me.  I shouldn't have worried about furmark, because the curve topped out at 65 degrees with silent case fans (noctua), and with a custom (still nearly silent) case fan setup I dropped a further 3 degrees to 62.  These temps are with a front mounted radiator, by the way.  Also, this was with a +200 on the core, +800 memory, 114% power limit, and 88 temp limit.  That blew my rtx 2060 out of the water, and because the temps stay low this card boosted rather high and rarely dropped clocks during heavy gaming.Now, for the important stuff.  I play some games 2k, some 4k, depending on the game.  2k this card is a winner.  4k I have run some older games at max or extremely high settings (Killing Floor 2 runs buttery smooth, so does GTA V).  I don't have any newer games to test at 4k so I can't say how well this card does, but I'd assume that with concessions in your graphics configurations you could get a lot of them going well.  I have a 4k monitor that runs at only 60hz refresh, so your mileage may vary.  I find 60hz to be fine for casual gaming, but some people don't.  I don't play many first person shooters so I don't need high refresh as much as I appreciate greater visual fidelity.In any case, as I have seen reviews that this card may fail after a while, I may update this review.  If I don't, awesome, this card rocks, and they have worked out their issues.  For now, however, I am enjoying my new graphics card, and it is definitely worth the money.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good budget (at 500 dollars, it can be 100 or 200 cheaper than other rtx 2070s so I suppose that fits) rtx 2070 for their build.  Great thermals, noise, and performance."", 'I purchased this EVGA RTX2070 for my son\'s birthday - he\'s an avid gamer.  He previously had an AMD R270 that was purchased 4+ years ago which was underpowered for current/recent games he would host.  I researched various video card reviews. The early reviews (when this RTX card was initially was released in 2018) cast shade on the RTX series stating they are overpriced and that Ray Tracing is hyped.  Ray Tracing is coming on now and will be more prominent in games.  And, leaving Ray Tracing aside for those games that don\'t support it, this is still a powerful/quality video card.  I wanted to purchase something built for the future with a good warranty.  I choose EVGA due to their warranty and good support and product quality reputation.  My son currently games at 1080p,  says he can have all the visual goodies maxed out on various recent games. (NOTE / PERSPECTIVE:  My son is not big on first person shooters anymore, just occasional FPS use, he\'s more into strategy games.  I don\'t game anymore, I used to in a different life.  : )  This 2070 card will support WQHD (1440p) gaming quite well.  From the reviews I have read, at resolutions above1440p (i.e. 4K gaming) the RTX2070 performance is nominal, just enough/adequate.  However, 4K gaming is nothing my son is interesting in.  Now before I get a mountain of opinions, I will say for my son\'s needs and purposes this card is excellent.  No hassles, no artifacts, high quality, high framerates.  He is in happy hog heaven.  The experience delivered to him is more than enough for his purposes.  This will most likely meet his needs for at least 2 - 3 years.  P.S. We are brand agnostic.  My main PC has an AMD card in it and I would and will buy AMD again if it\'s the solution for my purposes.  The AMD CPU releases are currently on fire.  I will say my son was relieved - or it was a plus to him - to receive an nVidia card.Only minor complaint:  It would have been nice to have video cable or two included.  We had to get in the car and drive to local Best Buy to purchase a Display Port cable.  (I own a mountain of HDMI, VGA and DVI cables but have not needed DP yet and son\'s current Dell monitor doesn\'t support HDMI.)  The new WQHD monitor he may get for Xmas will certainly support HDMI).  Other than that, no complaints.  I suppose unless you buy the uber deluxe cards you don\'t get a cable bundle.P.P.S.  DRIVER ANECDOTE:  Son\'s PC has Windows 10 OS.  I had cautioned him to first disinstall the AMD video card drivers from his older hardware he was leaving behind before powering down and then advised to replace with a fresh download of latest nVidia drivers. (I was also willing to burn a disk of latest nVidia drivers for him).  He waved off, didn\'t do that.  I was expecting problems from this.  But No!  He boots PC up with new nVidia RTX 2070 card.  It was flawless!  He was able to begin using his setup immediately.  The ""native"" nVidia drivers supplied in Windows 10 gave him a no drama experience and he could start using the PC and begin gaming.  I was kind of surprised.  In the ""old days"" that was a guaranteed recipe for problems.  Your Mileage May Vary but that\'s what we experienced.  I still encouraged him to obtain the nVidia site drivers ""to be sure"" but for now, things are fine.', 'Alright fine... I\'ll review the card since nobody wants to go first. :)Decided to get this card due to its price point compared to the big brothers (2080 and 2080ti respectively). I don\'t think I\'ll be the first or last when it comes to this reasoning. The RTX 2080ti is just too darn expensive and the 2080 is literally $300 more. I mean wow... just wow! Even at $570 the 2070 is a bit questionable. However, this card comes with a rigid back-plate and MASSIVE cooler/heatsink. In fact, the 2070, 2080 and 2080ti Ultra editions have the same huge heatsink. I know many of you might be wondering if the ""Ultra"" edition is worth it. YES! The noise/sound is significantly lower when on full load and well worth the extra $50-$70 you\'ll shell out. Do it!The 2070 is a good alternative to 1440p gaming, but I want to make it very clear. This card does not have the horsepower of its elder brethren. Don\'t get me wrong, this card will pull it\'s own weight and is much more justified in the price point than others; however, when compared to even a 2080 it\'s rightfully not in the same category. There is a noticeable difference between the two. I know what you\'re saying... there should be with a $300 difference in cost, but if you\'re looking for REAL power you may want to shell out the extra dough and go for the 2080. Wondering what this guy is talking about? I have both the 2070 and 2080... tested them both and the 2080 has raw power and is absolutely the perfect match for 1440p (144hz) gaming. So hard to justify the extra cost, but worth it (Figuratively speaking).The cost of the 2080 and 2080ti are simply a joke when you think about it, but if you\'re looking to game hard they are just better cards and NVIDIA/EVGA know it. I cannot tell you how beautiful and smooth Battlefield 1 runs with the 2080 in 2K. I know what you\'re thinking... the 2070 is just as good; it\'s just simply not! Yes, it will run things nicely and look fantastic... but you must understand the shear power isn\'t on par with the 2080 boys. Take that for what you will in a review format.The 2070 would be hard to justify for 1080p gaming as it\'s a beefy card. Instead, it\'s a good alternative to 1440p (No way it can handle 4k at high res). Notice I said a ""good"" alternative and not great to 1440p. The 2080 (Or old 1080ti) is the absolute perfect match for 2K (1440p/144hz) gaming and could do a decent job with 4K. However, I think we\'ll all agree the only way to play true 4K gaming is with the almighty 2080ti.Final thoughts... the 2070 is a great card all around. It will draw far less power than the 2080. On full load I never got above 63c (Compared to 72c with the 2080). If you\'re a true gamer, you\'re probably not too worried about power draw, but it\'s good to have this knowledge as power = heat. You\'ll sacrifice 20-30fps in most games when matched up against the 2080. Is that worth $300? You\'ll have to decide that for yourself. Just keep in mind you\'re making an investment here and if you\'re looking to future proof your computer...I hope this helps anyone on the fence wondering if the jump to 2080 is really worth it? Hard to justify with the cost... it really is. However, if you\'re a true gamer and want the best ""experience"" it just might be worth it to bump up to the 2080. :)', 'I\'ll jump right in. The RTX line is marketed as having distinct cores for both ray-tracing and artificial intelligence. This is a great design element. However- contrary to Nvidia\'s CEO- this functionality is not merely ""turned on"" at a whim. Game developers must use the new tools provided to them by both Nvidia and Microsoft to make full use of the Turing architecture. At the same time, they still must keep their games performant across as many devices as possible. Remember, hardly anyone has an RTX card. There\'s little incentive for game developers to rapidly adopt a potentially locked-down and proprietary technology. Nvidia may be forced to make their tools more open and transparent in the distant future if they wish to remain competitive.Therein lies the problem. There are very few current titles that utilize their RTX and DLSS cards, and the ones that do aren\'t necessarily stable. In 10 minutes of research you may read about Battlefield V\'s limited and quirky support for ray-tracing. Owning this card will allow you to run ray-tracing on \'low\' in BFV. Yes: \'low\' is the recommended setting for a $500+ retail card with both a 2050 and 2060 lined up for future release. I gave ray-tracing a go and while it looks O.K (yep, just O.K) a cataclysmic decrease in frame-rate manifested. This functionality is not ready for prime-time: period. Here\'s how 2018 should have ended in a better timeline:* Nvidia should have kept Turing in development for another 8-12 months, working closely with game developers on current and future titles to fully utilize their new APIs and toolset* Nvidia should have maintained production of the Pascal series, which is a wonderful, versatile architecture and arguably their best work to date* EA should not have rushed their flagship RTX game BFV, which has manifested as negative marketing for NvidiaAlas, Turing cards were released prematurely. Hardly any games fully use their functionality and Nvidia\'s brass runs the company like Google and Apple now- aiming for ever increasing profits with little to no risk. Reality has bit them hard.By the time RTX is ""optimal"" and developers have been caught up to speed, there may be a new series of graphics cards available for greater consumption. This includes cards produced by AMD, which has staged a comeback in the graphics arena. For this reason, if you\'re interested try to get an RTX on sale.With that said, performance of my RTX 2070 is solid. It\'s a respectable card. It can keep BFV (no RTX) with my GSYNC monitor at a stable framerate between 80 - 100 fps. Older games work fabulously. The card is a bit large; make sure you have the clearance. The various models listed here are mostly differentiated by the size of the heatsink. There is some silicon binning going on but it is unclear how much that matters for this particular lineup; the heatsink is the primary differentiator. I would only grab RTX cards on sale at the moment, especially considering AMD is staged to release a new card sometime this year. Temperatures are somewhat hot but fairly reasonable. I\'m seeing 60-68 degrees C under load during extended BFV multiplayer. Airflow is paramount with these cards as they critically rely on the heatsink, and the default fan curves tend to be very modest (to both reduce noise and prolong lifespan).TLDR* Good card overall, but marketed technology is not ready for showtime. Hardly any games fully utilize the architecture of distinct RT and AI cores. Current RT support is wonky and underwhelming. Consider picking up on sale.* Runs hot relative to Pascal. Avoid packing in a small and/or poor airflow case. Tweak fan curves (for both card and case) as needed.* Large. Make sure you have the space.', ""First of all, it is a mixed bag for me as a gamer. The card performs well enough to be as good as the GTX1080 or better but I can still get a GTX1080 for about the same price. The thing is, the RTX2070 does NOT have NVlink nor SLI, which is a bummer but then not all games will run SLI. I know which game does use SLI and I played them well with the previous generation. With the RTX2070, I will only need one card for 1440p with decent performance. So basically, it will lose out to the GTX1080 with SLI. So I'm not thrilled about that. Also, I gleamed at some benchmark that suggested that there is NO difference using SLI or NVLink on RTX cards. Using RTX2080 with NVLink does NOT have an advantage over 1080Ti with SLI (other then it being already slightly faster by itself). Not sure if this is really true. Maybe someone can shed more light on this. Anyway, this a good card because it is an EVGA XC card (XC Ultra is even better), which is by itself very well made and at this price worth getting. There are well-designed heat sinks and two metal plates which is great for cooling. So very glad it is EVGA (this is my 4th EVGA card).The second part is that I wish to use it as machine learning that can make use of the FP16 that the Pascal gen does not seem to have. Confusing benchmarks at different sites suggested that the RTX didn't have much or any advantage over the 1080Ti that I wish it would be because of the FP16. Apparently, the benchmarks are more about FP32, so again, there's not much I should be happy about having FP16 UNTIL the FP 16 and Tensor Cores are fully made use of. The FP16 codes are few and far between other than benchmarks. Maybe I'm new. I wanted to get the RTX2080 or RTX2080Ti to use the NVLink but according to a site that has tested NVLinks, it works like SLI BUT not in TCC mode which allows 2 linked cards to share memory, effectively doubling the size in a high bandwidth bridge. So using it for Rendering is pretty much no advantage over the 1080Ti unless the Raytracing cores are fully utilized. When that happens, you will wish that you can use the cards in TCC mode when you run out of memory because the scene is big! The infinite number of Ray Tracing cores will not help because it will most likely run out of memory with big scenes and you do not want to just do little small scenes like a hobbyist (there are setups with 8x1080Ti for GPU Rendering).  AMD VEGA FE (16GB) with HBCC uses available DDR4 RAM. Not as fast but better than crashing when running out of memory. There are Rendering engines that can do distributed GPU loads but through the PCIe bus (much slower than the High Bandwidth link). Anyway, this is not PCI-E 4.0. Even if it is, a single NVLink will have the same bandwidth.So that's about it. It is still a really good card regardless. IF by any chance NVLink is enabled in TCC mode in the future, I'll think about getting a few more of the RTX2080Ti."", 'Got mine OC\'d to a stock 1080Ti with the built in(to EVGA Precision) automatic overclocking software. My Galaxy S9+ came with a USB C to USB A 3.0 adapter so I plugged it into my GPU\'s USB C port and what do you know my 3 Sensors and HMD are no longer starving my PC\'s USB Bandwidth - to be clear, I could barely even get a mouse and keyboard running on this - I had to unplug a sensor every time I wanted to plug in a flash drive (with 2 sensors) or use a (blasphemous) wifi dongle. So now not only can I plug stuff into my USB ports (glorious controllers and bluetooth devices ;u; ) but I can also tell that my sensors were fighting for bandwidth because it seems that the tracking is better to boot! (:You\'ll notice that I seriously just spent my entire review up until this point praising the fact that this has a ""built in Inatek USB HUB"" and that\'s because it\'s kind of the only thing it has over a GTX 1080 Ti (and my micro atx motherboard didn\'t have a PCIE Slot which I didn\'t find out about until AFTER I ordered the USB Hub >.< ). RTX isn\'t here yet, DLSS is clearly and obviously worse than current AA solutions, and there\'s no guarantee that you\'ll get a GPU capable of overclocking like mine did (while STUFFED in a small case that isn\'t supposed to be able to fit this card and fans pressed up against the bottom of the case which has a PSU blowing hot air + an overclocked R5 2600 blowing hot air right next to it and TERRIBLE ventilation in this cheap case.. you get the idea).I recommend, quite frankly, to either get a 2080 if you want performance, 1080 Ti / AMD\'s new GPU for this price, or a 2060 if you desperately need RTX but don\'t want 1080 (maybe 1080 Ti) performance. This card is priced weirdly is what I\'m getting at. It can\'t do RTX well enough for most gamers to love considering it can do 4K at ultra settings OR pretty puddles. A 2060 would be a far better choice for most prosumers not planning on getting into VR and a 2080 is so much better than this that I can\'t imagine why one wouldn\'t upgrade to it unless you\'re like me and only play VR games and develop games / create CG in your spare time / hobby.I hope that wasn\'t too rambly. If you\'re getting a 2070 I do highly recommend this one. Only weird thing is that it\'s blue by default. WHY make an NVIDIA card blue??? Thankfully it\'s easy to change the colors and I set mine green but COME ON guys :P', 'This card lasted me 5 years and endless hours of videogames, what more could i say? It could probably last another 5 years at this rate.', ""Installed like a champ and booted right up. Nvidia Drivers are the easiest to install IMO. I'm now able to run MHW at full spec texture pack and all at 1080p with great results. Rise of the tomb raider did give me a hiccup though when it crashed after about30-40 minute playing at full on max settings. I don't know if that was the card or the optimization of game. I must say though While i was playing rise of the tomb raider the game ran EXTREMELY well at full setting. I had no inclination that it was going to crash before it did. no screen tearing no jitters. it just ran perfect. The bench mark tool in ROTR got an average FPS of 55 at fully maxed out settings with DX12 on which i think is pretty respectable. I also ran warframe on this card. obviously warframe can't even touch the max capabilities of this card. I have yet to try out other demanding games like FF15 and modern shooters but i have no reason to believe this card won't run those at max settings 1080p with no problems. I'm going to DL the FF15 Demo tonight and try it with RT on and off and see what kind of results i get and update my review later.  this card is VERY pricey. If you already have a 1080TI there is no reason to upgrade from that card to any current card. You still have the best card on the market. If you have a card that is weaker than a 1080ti and you want to upgrade this card is great option to future proof yourself with the ray tracing capabilities  but if you need the most vram you can get go for the 1080ti with it's 11 gb of ram.  I want to recommend the RX5700 and RX 5700xt because of their great performance to price ratio but i have had 2 5700's and neither would even boot into windows. Any who do your research and compare cards old and new and figure out which card is best for you and your budget. I happen to really dig this one.*UPDATE* YOOOOOOOOO i just got an email from amazon with a code for two free games because i bought this card: The games are wolfenstein youngblood and control! Hey can't complain about free haha."", ""I wanted to make sure I waiting for a while before I submitted a review due to the concern of artifacting. I have had my card for about 3 months and I have zero issues. I have been very happy with my purchase.I decided to go with the Ultra model because I was interested in overclocking as well as hoping to have a better shot at the digital lottery for the chip set. It comes out of the box with a clock speed of 1725 MHz, and with minor use of the EVGA Precision X1 software I was able to get it to 1975 MHz. The oversize heat sink looks massive in my case, but it keep my card at some pretty reasonable temps while I play games at around 60 C with the fans at only around 50% speed and when I am just web browsing it sits at about 43 C with no fans going which is nice for the noise level. Games I play are Forza Horizon 4, Sea of Thieves, Anthem, WoW, and Fallout 4. Every game is performing at the top or near top settings and are playing great on my 27 inch 2k monitor at 1440p. Finally RGB lights, which shouldn't effect your buying decision, but dang they are fun as well as look good.I do have some downsides to this card.Thickness: This card is massive taking up 3 card slots, which is something I knew ahead of time. But if you need all 3 PSI slots on your motherboard you might want the slimmer version.RTX Format: As of right now there isn't much that can take advantage of this technology and the hit it takes on your fps is kind of disappointing. I am hoping that RTX gets better overtime.Price: I picked up this card at $570 sale which was somewhat nice since it helped offset the cost of tax that I would have paid if I paid full retail price. Otherwise if you don't want RTX (or RGB lights I guess) then you might be better off looking for a 1080 card.All in all I am very happy with my card and it was a drastic upgrade from my 1050 Ti EVGA card.  I hope this review helps someone else with buying this card."", '** Update 12/7/2018 **I\'ve been using this graphics card for almost a month. I\'ve paired it with a 24"" G-SYNC Dell S2417DG monitor. For gaming, I\'ve used it mostly for Black Ops 4.  I can run it on the highest video settings in 2560x1440dpi at about 100-110fps, but I tone down some of the graphics settings to High vs. Very High for a little better performance.  The fps drops down to perhaps 80 at times when a lot of action is happening, but it\'s for a a second or two and varies depending on which weapon or character is being used. I like running at the higher dpi for browsing, looking at photos, etc.  and this video card handles rending everything quickly.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase and didn\'t want to spend any more money than this on a video card. I\'m not sure if the ray tracing feature will make much difference and it didn\'t factor into my decision much, but I look forward to trying it on upcoming games whenever possible.****I upgraded from a GTX 760.  Reading text and YouTube reviews, this card specs out similar to a 1080 at around the same price (for the Ultra model, even less for black edition).  Though it has less cuda cores than the 1080, it has a faster memory architecture which makes up the speed difference.The card didn\'t seem as massive in my system as the reviews make it out to be.  My tower case fits it just fine with room left to spare.  My 620 watt power supply is sufficient.The cooling system is well engineered and I don\'t hear the card fans at all even when gaming (playing Black Ops 4 lately). The two fans don\'t run much while you are not using it for gaming.  I initially wondered if the fan system was broken when I first put it in with the case side cover off to check on it. :)Overall, this card is a good alternative to the 1080 which will probably be phased out and still seems somewhat scarce on Amazon.  The 1080ti would be nice, but I didn\'t want to pay $800-900 for a bit more performance.Get yourself a higher performance monitor with a DisplayPort connector to match this video card power.  HDMI caps out at around 75hz.  This card can technically go up to 240hz with a DP connector.  A better monitor is my next purchase.']"

Very happy', ""Product is working great with my Z390 (Intel 9th Gen) motherboard and RTX 3070.  I was almost scared off from reviews on here saying the cable caused GPU failure, but glad I wasn't.  Its only been 3 days of use, but the system has been left on for long periods of time during those 3 days and everything is working great.  I haven't had any signal loss issues and the cable is working perfectly.  I am using the cable in the Phanteks P600S, which is one of the cases this cable was specifically designed for.  It securely mounts in the case and provides a good resting point for my graphics card.  I was worried about heat issues with the GPU since it is somewhat pushed up against the glass wall of the case, but my temps have been the same as when it was mounted directly to the motherboard.  The Phanteks P600S provides 3 slots for vertical GPU mounting so this card sits back far enough from the glass that it isn't an issue. (1-1.5 inches)*AMD RYZEN USERS PLEASE NOTE*:  I have seen some questions regarding RTX 3000 cards (and other PCIe Gen 4 graphics cards) and this riser cable.  The riser cable is only rated for PCIe Gen 3, not PCIe Gen 4.  The new RTX 3000 cards are PCIe Gen 4, but backwards compatible with PCIe Gen 3.  The problem could arise when using the cable with a Ryzen chipset that is PCIe Gen 4 and an RTX 3000 card that is PCIe Gen 4 with this PCIe Gen 3 cable.  Before purchasing this cable, check your BIOS to make sure you can select PCIe Gen 3 as an option.  Doing this should allow the cable to work perfectly.  As far as speed is concerned, PCIe Gen 4 is much faster than PCIe Gen 3 on paper, but current GPU hardware can't fully utilize the speed of PCIe Gen 4 so you shouldn't see any performance drops switching back to Gen 3.  The only performance drop you may see is if you are currently using a PCIe Gen 4 M.2 NVME SSD.  NVME SSDs run on the PCIe lanes, so switching back to Gen 3 could see a loss of performance.  That being said, if you are primarily gaming, you won't notice the performance loss.If you are running any intel chipset, then this should work fine since all intel chipsets through Intel 10th Gen are PCIe Gen 3 (11th Gen is slated to be PCIe Gen 4).  Also, it should work fine on any older graphics cards that are PCIe Gen 3."", ""Actually this cable is working perfectly fine, and it is premium feeling and solid, I liked it, unfortunately now with my case and my big fat GPU I had to make my GPU horizontal again, so now I'm not using it to not sacrifice performance of my GPU as fan will be so close to the side panel.If you have a 2-slot GPU or you can watercool your GPU, you can't be wrong using this."", ""This product comes with very little documentation and I almost returned the product thinking it was broken. It turns out it was a BIOS setting that needed to be changed.What it should tell you but doesn't, is that you need to set PCI-E speed to 3.0/4.0 and enable above 4G decoding in the BIOS.

If it's too close you can start to get overheating issues as the fans be choked for air."", 'Product works great for what it is meant for - extending your PCIe interface somewhere else.  My intended use case was to vertically mount my GPU in my case.  I though that since I have a dual slot card and the case had room for a triple slot in its vertical mount position, things would be ok.  Sadly the vertical mount increased the perceived fan noise (louder from my sitting position at the same rpm) and increased thermals by 5 - 7 degrees celsius.  *This is of no fault to the product!*  It worked perfectly for what it is meant to do and the vertical mount position looked great as well.  Sadly trading the performance for looks was not in my interest so I did end up returning the product.  Just remember to keep everything in mind when looking to re-orient a major component such as your video card.', 'Testato con GTX 1060 funziona perfettamente.', ""What I don't like is that I had to buy this separately from my new Phanteks P600s case.  That said, the product looks and feel durable and well made and up to what I think of as Phanteks' typical quality.  I did buy the 220mm version and I'm glad I did as while the shorter 200mm version might have worked fine, this one gives me just a little bit of flexibility in attaching it to the video card and MB - I do not feel like it is too long.I'm not seeing any of the crinkling of the cable when it's bent as some have reported and the thickness and the cable is not overly stiff.  In fact, I think the feel and flexibility of the cable is perfect.The 200mm cable would almost certainly have worked, but I'm glad I went with the 220mm.  It's working perfectly and I think it's as well made as I can image such a cable should be, so I highly recommend this riser if you want either show off your video card or simply take the weight off the MB and not deal with sag (though consider the more restricted cooling you might have if you mount your card vertically!)"", ""This is a well made cable, but does not support PCIe Gen4 at all. This is fine, as it isn't advertised as such, but I want to make people aware.Also, it is a sleezy move for Phanteks to basiccally design their case mounts to only fit with their own brand of rise cable and then charge a premium for it.If you want to save money, use a dremel and a cheaper riser cable.""]"

Less noise, but more heat and heat is a killer of speed.  I used EVGA Precison X1 to set manual fan curves.  Mine are 70% through 80c then 100%.  My case has 6 Noctua fans ($20.00 each).  While the stock Corsair fans are reasonably quiet, the Noctua fans are silent.  Yes, you hear AIR whooshing, but the video card rarely gets above 70c.  My TV is a Samsung 4K 48"" with no Gsync or Freesync.  Playing WoW with all but ground clutter at max (so i can see chests etc. easier) the lowest fps was 70 (flying really fast over the tree tops) and my average is 120 (pretty much every where).  No tearing or stuttering and no AA enabled in the WoW menu.  This particular card is HUGE.  If you did want to use two of them, the top cards fan air intakes would be severely restricted.  Why you would need two does beg the question as one RTX 2080 Ti (EVGAS\' top model) runs 4K with ZERO issues.  Replacing my EVGA 1080 Ti FTW3.  My 1080 ran my 27"" rogswift IPS monitor (same settings) with no issues, but did struggle at times running my 4k TV, but it DID run my 4k TV.  If like me you really really want to play games on a large 4k TV, EVGAs 2080 Ti fits the bill.  down side? it\'s $1,500.00.  I was holding out for AMD and Nvidia to release their next set of video cards, but decided not to wait until October or even later. My ASUS X-99 decided to quit working, so went with GIGABYTE X570 Auros Master, two Sabrent 1T 4.0 and 3600x chip set.  Only one M.2 slot is pcie 4.0 the other 2 are 3.0.  I liked the cost and feature set of the MB versus other offerings that had two or more 4.0 enabled M.2 slots.  I do not have any tools that would show how fast the X-99 (with Samsung M.2) versus the X570 are, but both boot quickly (at least the X-99 used to).  Cost was just under $1,000 to replace my MB, chip set and two HD.  I included information on my system so you would know what the 2080 ti was running in.  I\'ve built 5 computers for family members and all 5 used Corsair carbide air 540.  Windowed panel, thumb screws for panels and filters and VERY easy to install components in.Bottom line:  If a 2080 Ti is in your budget, it\'s a great performer.', 'I have an old Cool Master case that has 7 120mm fans pulling and pushing air. This thing DOSE NOT GET THE LEAST BIT HOT! I have NOT overclocked at ALL. Just out of the box hooked it up and this thing is a beast and has not stopped impressing me. It does all the graphics and rendering I want without hiccups or lags. I LOVE this video card and have trusted EVGA for YEARS! I will NEVER buy ANYTHING LESS. I am blown AWAY! Why did I wait a Year to post a review? To just see if all the nightmares that everyone was saying about it would happen. As I suspected. EVGA did the right thing and changed the cuda cores chip sets and did not skimp on the hardware in manufacturing. Why do you think it cost the price of a used car? I mean you may be able to pick one up cheaper today. A year ago it was $1500+, so yea. I wanted to make for sure that this baby was going to perform and do what I wanted. Furthermore, as a older computer Nerd I need to tell the newbies. AIR FLOW AND COOLING IS KEY NUMBER, 1, UNO, TOP OF THE LINE WITH THINGS LIKE THIS!!!!!!Gezz, I see so many people out there complaning that their rig burned up because they over clocked it with 2 case fans! :/ WHAT? WAIT? YOU SAID WHAT? MY HEAD HURTS NOW! I digress.If you are looking to have a MONSTER and you got the $$$$ buy a EVGA RTX 2080 Ti because this thing is a beast just out of the box without any overclocking. I can not imagine, well YES i can IMAGINE, BUT I do not want to. This thing cost alot for me. Some people make this kind of $$ in seconds and blow this kind of $$ on a night on the town. I would be kicked out of the house if I did that. I have to work to pay this off. So you see this is a investment for me, not a toy. Have Fun and I hope this helps someone who is looking to upgrade to a MONSTER of a video card. I know I love mine. I will have it for a very long time. My work is slow at the moment because work on my shop is in progress, and this THING that was sprung on us ;).', ""+ Excellent overclocking headroom+ Beautiful design and LEDs+ Runs fairly quiet and cool+ Incredible performance+ Precision X1 software has some very useful tools and information- Had to return the first one due to crashing and BSOD- Price to performance is awful (NVIDIA's fault, not EVGA)- Potential for GPU sag- Precision X1 software loves to crash on my system a lot of the timeThis card is an absolute star performer and will handle gaming, video editing, art design, and anything else you can throw at it, with ease. I don't blame EVGA for the pricing as NVIDIA controls the pricing points for each level of GPU, but because of this pricing, it is hard to recommend this card to pure gamers unless they are after decent frames in 4K. The price to performance ratio is abysmal for gamers.Ray Tracing (RTX), the card's main selling point, is not readily available in mainstream gaming titles, and when it is activated, it becomes a major performance hit as it will drop frames dramatically. NVIDIA's answer to this drop was supposed to be Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), and while it may work, there are even fewer titles that can utilize that feature.I have had no issues overclocking between 100-150 MHz on the core clock, and over 1000 on the memory clock, and during both stock and overclocked settings, this gpu never went over 70 degrees celsius on the stock fan curve. With a custom, and more aggressive fan curve, the temperature hovers between 60-65 degrees in my terrible summer weather.Precision X1 software is useful and provides the user with lots of data and temperature read outs that you will not find on other software, and overclocking is a breeze within this utility. I still do not use it over MSI Afterburner simply because it crashes about 50% of the time when I use it. It is more a question of when, rather than if, but when X1 becomes more stable through patches and updates it will be an excellent software program to use with this card and others.Overall, it is an incredible graphics card which I would definitely recommend to people who are after a gpu that will excel at more than just gaming, like video editing and graphic/art design, or alternatively, if you are a hardcore gamer, with an enthusiast level PC that is after 4K 60+ FPS or 1440p 120+ FPS on maxed out settings, this card will fit the bill, and that bill will be large.My specs for reference:Intel i7-9700K @ 5.0 GHz32GB RAM @ 3200 MHz"", 'This is an absolute beast of a GPU. It’s basically overkill. It can run every game ultra settings on 1440p. It can also run almost all games high settings on 4k. If you are gaming on 1080p or 1440p, You don’t need to turn on the fans, because the card can easily handle these resolutions, which makes it extremely silent. While gaming on higher resolution and higher settings, you still might not need the fans on that high, but if it makes you comfortable, go for it! On the EVGA Software, you can pick the speed of the fans, if you put anything under 40% speed it’s practically silent, and it cools the gpu very well. Even for heavy gaming, there is no reason to take the fans to over 60% because 60% speed with these 3 fans and big heatsink, cools the card just fine. However, this card is extremely expensive right now, and won’t fit most people’s budget. Any card really won’t fit your budget currently. But if i’m just reviewing the card and not the price then this card is probably overkill, but a gamers dreams. Again, this thing is a beast, and will satisfy your gaming experience for years to come. If you know that these prices aren’t going down soon and you need a beefy GPU, this is the card for you. PS. You might want to buy a sag bracket at the time of buying this GPU, this gpu is a monster in performance, and size. I forgot to buy one, and I can already see the card tilting down, this really isn’t a problem at first, but overtime that sag can grow and potentially rip the pcie connecter of the PCB of the GPU or rip the pcie slot of the motherboard.', 'Im torn between the review on this card.  I previously had 2 x 1070\'s SLI getting 130 to 200 fps with 2 x 28"" monitors on the same game comparison, that is single core game.With the 2080 ti, Im getting 100fps with  the same 2 x 28"" monitors with additional 49"" monitor.  With that being said, maybe the reason Im not getting 200 fps with the added resolution/pixel count having to be pushed.  I know there Is other factors but seems for a $1400 gpu, I should get atleast the same fps that I would using 2 x 1070s with screen tearing even when 49"" was added.  Customer service agreed it shouldnt of lowered to half the fps.Pros:- 100 fps 4k gaming- Good looking card- 100 fps on 3 monitors (49"" @ 144hz. / ultra settings, 2 x 28"" at 60hz)- Smooth game play- No Screen tearingCons:- 100 fps- On the noisy side. Albeit, the fans do get up to 3k rpms, the air flow its self is going to be the cause. Tolerable at 2k rpms.- Slight fan scraping noise only at start up.... its not my pc, qs I keep the witing tight and wasnt making noise with the 1070\'s.Now I was getting screen freezing from the initial startup of the 2080 ti. Called customer service and the recommended switching PCI slots, I did and it resolved the freezing issue (weird).Additionally, I am happy with the final result, and will continue to be as long as this card lasts 2 years, with the price in mind to make it worth it.PC Specs that may or may not have something to do with my giving it 4 stars.I7 6700k: Although not an i9, there are no signs of bottle necking as it runs under 15% under load.  I know... might be completely wrong on this.Gigabyte gaming 1 motherboard3400hz ram: oc\'d and running stable qround 3200.1000w evga gold standard power supply3 monitors (49"" Asus, 2 x 28"" Asus)Samsung Pro SSD', ""Neither EVGA nor NVidia can be totally blamed for the insane prices of video cards (Good Ole Capitalism) but price aside this card is amazing.I'm using the Precision X1 software to OC the card and I am very pleased with the results. MSI Afterburner is regarded as a superior OC tool but it does not provide control for the three fans on the 2080 Ti Ftw3 Ultra, which are recognized by Precision X1. I have been able to push the settings far enough to get a graphics score of 18715 in 3DMark-Time Spy. The card is installed in a system running Win 10 64bit with an Intel i5-3570 3.4GHz CPU and 16GB RAM. The bottleneck is the Intel Motherboard and CPU; they are both over ten years old, so the benchmarks would probably be higher with more up-to-date hardware. On games without ray-tracing (Mass Effect: Andromeda, Starcraft II, Crysis 3) the card barely hits 60C. Games with ray-tracing (e.g. Metro 2033 Redux) it maxes out at about 72C with no visual signs of any stress.As for the physical card itself, EVGA builds a rock-solid piece of hardware. It is compact (for a 2000 Series), rugged and reliable. I have been pushing it hard for over a year now and it shows no sign of fatigue. And it is darn pretty to boot.This was a gift to myself and I'm glad I ponied up the cash, especially since prices have gone even higher. If you are serious about gaming you can't go wrong with this card - if you can still find it."", ""The first one of these I bought had a stability problem.  I'm not sure if the built in boost was too much or what.  The card ran fine for the most part. Passed the all the extreme 3dMark Stress Tests and benchmarks easily. My brother happen to ask me what it scored on the FFXIV Benchmark. I wanted to see high numbers, so I tried it out.  I never got to see those numbers with that card though.  Every time the benchmark got to a certain point it crashed.  By crashed, I mean it actually reset my computer.  That got me looking for what could be the problem (This is a brand new rig I just put together, so it could have been anything at that point.). I eventually found out that if i reduced the clock speed of the card by 200 it made it through the Benchmark. I requested an exchange of the card on Amazon, and they sent me a new one.  The new one worked perfectly through all the stress tests and the FFXIV benchmark (I got my high numbers).  That is my reason for 4 stars.  It's a great card...if you can get one that works.  I never expected the FFXIV benchmark to point out an instability that 3dMark extremes tests didn't, but it did.  All in all, I'm happy with the card. I just wish it was not such a gamble.-Update (4/15/19)I'm going to bump this to 5 star since I have now found the problem. I started having the same problems with the new card I got. If you run into the same problem I had of the computer suddenly turning off and resetting, try using separate cables for each 8pin PCIe Power plug on the card.  I found that one PCIe cable that splits into two 8pin connectors cannot supply enough power (or atleast the cables that came with the corsair HX850i cant).  After I plugged in separate cables for each 8pin PCIe slot, the card worked fine in the spots the computer was crashing in."", ""I have a 1440p 120hz monitor and this card runs everything on ultra at 60+ fps. Often times above 90+ fps. After some tinkering (including setting a voltage curve in MSI afterburner), I can get the card to run at 1.093 v and 2130 mhz clock (and 8000 memory). Unfortunately, the clock can drop down to 2025 mhz if the game is demanding enough.  So that's frustrating. It seems like others have better luck but I don't know under what conditions they maintain their clocks.It seems that the struggle the card has is cooling. I can crank all fans to 100% and the degrees continue to creep up. Most games top out around 65 C but some march on to 70-72 C. To me, that doesn't seem too hot, but the issue is that the card downclocks with each mystery interval of temperature gained. So I start at 2130 and watch it retreat to 2025.Strangely (or maybe not strangely), I've done in-game benchmarks comparing the FPS in a full OC state vs just sliding the power gauge to max and there really isn't a difference in the numbers.This card does promise to have a higher power limit, and it does deliver. I can watch it pull 373 w consistently. I don't know if that translates into more performance, but I think it's awesome.Anyways, I think it's a great card. Games perform really well. Turning on RTX does drop FPS down to 50-60.I just don't understand why I can set the GPU temp target to 89 when this seems to be completely ignored. As early as 50 C I can see the clock drop by small intervals. But I dare not question the mystery and majesty that is Nvidia."", 'This is a 20series card and for months I held off buying one cause of the reports of many failing cards. However I decided to risk it and buy this card and I made sure to get all the protection plans. I will update this review more in the future too but for now my thoughts...This card is insane. Hands down one of the best and strongest gaming cards out there. The water cooler keeps this card very cool never goes above 61c in high gaming loads for hours on end. This card is a little noisy with the water pump but the fans themselves are extremely quiet and was very suprised how effective the watercooling is at such low fan speeds. So if your wearing headphones you will not hear this card at all. There is a little bit of coil whine but not much at all especially compared to other cards I have owned. This cards smashes everything I throw at it in 2k/144hz with games like AC Odyssey running around 80-120fps. If you have the money and can afford it I do recommend this card. As for longevity we will have to see. Had this card for about 2 months now and 0 problems and the installation process was very easy. I have had many EVGA cards in the past and have always loved their build quality and warranty. This card has an amazing build quality to it and the hoses are very sturdy and durable. I have not overclocked this card so I have no information to give regarding how this card overclocks.So all in all my final opinion on this is if you are willing to spend the money for this card it is definately worth it. I recommend getting at least a year warranty along with this card.']"

Pure Power L8-CM 630W ATX 2.3"", ""Awesome cables!  Very thick but this is great if you need heavily shielded. I was able to twist these cables to get fit into a half height slot, and they worked fantastically (most cables did not). These babies are expensive, but well, well, well worth the price. No other cable that I twisted was able to fit through a half-height slot and continued to work. NO LOSS OF SIGNAL, and can be twisted any way you want!  Best of both worlds.  I literally spent $100 on cheap cables and after a while they resulted in a system halt due to PCIe signal fault.  I had to throw them out.  I am using a souped up 256GB 82TB RAID 6 SuperMicro  Dual E5-2697 v2 48 cores. The case is only 2U and thus only has half height slots.  ALL OF THE OTHER CABLES REQUIRED TWSITING OR CRIMPING TO FIT IN THE 2U SLOT ON THE CASE!  This is why they failed, If you see the pictures, these cable DO NOT use ribbon cables, these are individual wires that are shielded and divided.  This way you can navigate these cables to fit into very tight spaces. MOREOVER, and this is the best part.... NO SIGNAL LOSS. Moreover they do not obstruct the adjacent PCIe lanes. If you look at the supermicro X9dri-ln4f MOBO you get alot of PCIe slots, but he space is very, very tight, especially in a 2u case. Yeah they aren't cheap, but you better believe they are worth every damn penny, especially if you had to go through wasting the time, energy, money and suffering the frustrations all the other cables caused me."", ""A riser cable can never increase your framerates.  However, it can absolutely hinder them.That said, I saw zero framerate drop between cabled and my 2080 (non-ti version) plugged straight into the motherboard.  I ran multiple benchmarks (3DMark, in-game, etc) with and without, and differences were within margin of error.I did notice about a 4-6C drop, under load, in temps on the card, and about 2C drop on the CPU, due simply to the fact that the card was off and away from the motherboard.  These temps are with the case side-door open (more on that below).Cable seems very high quality, and was sufficiently long (actually just a bit TOO long) for a standard mid-tower case.  Kind of wish there were color options other than just grey, as a vertically mounted GPU on a showcase PC is sexy, but kinda let down by the bland cable.  I think CableMods exists because I'm not the only one who cares about aesthetics to the point of custom-coloring our ATX cables.Sadly, the ASUS ROG Strix 2080 I bought is a 2.75 slot card, and is just too thick to mount vertically in my Corsair 500D case.  It gives me about a 1/4inch gap if I close the case door, and then the temps just skyrocket.  I used it instead in my old case with my old 980ti, which seems to get enough airflow; dropping temps by a few degrees even with the door closed.Good product, despite me not checking if I could properly fit my GPU vertically.  Hopefully one of you learns from my oversight."", ""Comprato per un progetto DIY in cui necessitavo per foza di questo tipo di prolunga, con questo tipo di connettore.

I paid upwards of $70 for this thing and expected it would be good and essentially perform the one basic thing that it’s designed for without dropping frames. In my experience, a high price point usually indicates exceptional material and quality assurance. In this case, it absolutely did not.I read some of the bad reviews and should have listened, but I figured they were probably talking about the budget line of cables, not the premium one I was looking at. It’s hard to tell since they’re all grouped together on the same page. One more selling point was that my mobo has 2 PCIe 4.0 ports on it so I figured I’d go the future proof route and this item is sadly it right now if that’s what you’re trying to accomplish.Immediately after connecting this thing to my RDX 2080 ti and plugging it into my Prime X570 Pro  motherboard, I experienced boot issues and the fan on my graphics card ran constantly at full speed,  then BIOS would try to load, the error light on the mobo indicated an issue with the graphics card, boot would fail, then the system would reload and repeat the cycle until a reset screen appeared from too many failed attempts. After the reset screen, I could get to Windows without making any actual changes in BIOS. Windows took significantly longer to load than normal and crashed sporadically while running. Every time I would reboot, I would have to do the same thing. I tried removing and reinserting the riser firmly. It doesn’t really lock in place on the motherboard (which felt cheap) so I thought maybe it wasn’t seated correctly. I tried reseating it and using multiple ports - nothing helped.I have read some cables aren’t well shielded and thought maybe that was the source of the issue. To test this theory, I wrapped the entire cable in anti static shielding plastic four times over and from terminal to terminal - absolutely no change.The second I took the riser cable out of the situation, everything went back to working flawlessly. I seriously hope this thing didn’t damage any of the components of my rig. I thought I could trust it because I paid enough to expect a good quality cable. Save yourself a few hours of wasted time and potential damage to your rig and look elsewhere. At least to me, it’s not worth the risk and this thing is getting returned first thing in the morning. Lesson learned: never buy a Linkup brand cable again.', 'Das Produkt ist nicht zu gebrauchen, die Leistung der Grafikkarte kommt nicht am Mainboard an. Ferner friert der PC ein sobald die GPU Last zu bewältigen hat.', ""Brought this for my new case (Cosmos 700p) after reading about the potential patchy support for PCI 4 with the current riser cables available on the market.It is easy to fit in a case where i can reposition the graphics card to any angle between 0 and 90 degree's and after playing Hitman 3 and Forza Horizon on my 3090 i can confirm it works as though it were slotted directly into the motherboard without having to change any BIOS settings.I have attached a a picture with it at a 75-80 degree angle. It's definately worth the purchase if your having issues or want to prevent issues.""]"

For reference, I paired this up with a Framework laptop for testing, and I used Linux as the OS of choice. Initial OS issues aside, this did a decent job. With a decent (don't waste money on a high end GPU) GPU, it can easily improve or outperform the onboard graphics present on many laptops. However, don't forget its one major limitation: data throughput. The PCIe port is only 4-lane, and Thunderbolt 3 is limited to the same. Don't tout Thunderbolt 4 when it comes to this kind of usage; In reality, Thunderbolt 4 is a poor performer when it comes to eGPUs because it doesn't increase throughput and also it holds back an entire data channel for other purposes, resulting in LESS bandwidth for your eGPU. That's a Thunderbolt design standard, not a fault of this device.Just pair this chassis with a decent GPU designed around an x4 PCIe slot. Once you do that, you'll get surprisingly good performance from this little case. Also remember not to unplug it without shutting down the laptop first. eGPU hotplug is not yet reliable, and that's on Windows. It's entirely non-existent on Linux.The cable that comes with it is short (1m), but this is somewhat by requirement. If you need a longer cable, spend the money for something well-made and don't go cheap. With the bandwidth this device uses, quality cables are critical. Also, don't plan to put this chassis distant from the laptop. You won't find a cable longer than 2m. If you do, it's a scam. Look up the specs for Thunderbolt 3 if you don't want to believe my word. A 2m length cable is the longest length supported, and that is backed up by testing and design requirements. Adding extenders to break that limit will only result in problems.The chassis is solid metal, but the design has some issues. You'll need to remove one or both side plates to install your GPU (and maybe a SATA drive for the adventurous; there is no mounting bracket but there is a port). The side panels are structural for this device, but the fittings aren't that solid. Yes, that means it does warp over time. There will be gaps that form, and it's not going to keep perfect appearance for long. However, it is stable enough to work without risk of it collapsing or warping too severely on its own.People complained about the 1Gb Ethernet port being glitchy. This may have been the case on previous drivers, and I've experienced them with the same chipset on other devices. However, the network here stayed connected and perfectly reliable over testing that lasted multiple weeks. Hopefully this means that a driver update has sorted out all of the issues.Overall: Let your need be your guide on this. It's a good, solid platform, but it's not without its limitations. Simply put, you're not going to get an equivalent to a high-end gaming workstation's performance."", ""Using it with a PowerColor RX 5600-XT on a 16 inch MacBook Pro, it works, but only just. If you've got a Mac, this is a good pick. If you have an older TB3 ultrabook, stay away.First of all, just forget about using any of the expansion ports on this thing. If you're building a laptop docking station, just get a USB-C hub for the rest of your stuff. The ports don't work at all on Windows, and while I did get them to work on MacOS, my keyboard still flickered out every 30 seconds. The fact of the matter is, the GPU needs to use as much of the TB3 bandwidth as possible to maximize performance, and anything else you connect takes away from that. It's actually the same logic board that the Sonnet 550 uses, but Sonnet chose not to include the expansion ports because of the issues.I tested it with my Macbook and with an older HP Spectre x360. On the Mac, it's plug-and-play except for the ports being finnicky, the GPU works like a charm. But when connected to the Spectre, it doesn't even power on. Just makes repeated clicking noises. This might be related to the TB3 controller on the Spectre going through the PCH versus the direct line to the CPU in the Macbook. Doesn't seem to be a faulty PSU like other reviewers have reported though.Finally, the build quality is about what you expect for the cheapest eGPU box you can get. Installation of the GPU requires taking out quite a few screws, and the whole thing is made of a cheap-looking powdercoated metal that scuffs and scratches very easily. It's also got a very obnoxious blue power LED on the front, which is fortunately very easy to disable by unplugging the blue/white wire from the logic board.Bottom line: This unit seems picky about which laptops it wants to work with. I got lucky, but I'd say it's worth the extra 60 bucks for the Core X if you don't want to take that chance."", ""I shopped around for many of these before I settled on this one. What I liked about it was that it's essentially a complete dock for my laptop. It has an ethernet port, USB ports on the front and back, and of course, a PCI-E slot for a graphics card.Noise is pretty good with this. You can hear it when it's working hard, but it's not annoying, better than a full PC I would say.The ethernet port seems to work without any issues. I have had a few instances where it drops out and I have to reboot to get it back. But it's happened maybe 2-3 times since I've been using it. I also suspect this is due to the power in my home not being so great.The USB ports I have to review pretty critically, they're full USB 3.0 which is great, and you can get full USB 3.0 speeds with them, however, the power they produce is really not great, if I plug my phone in to charge, I will usually have less power on my phone after a few hours. The power issue can be problematic especially with devices that need extra power when they're working harder, like a portable disk drive. This was solved by getting a powered USB 3.0 hub. So a separate power supply handles that and just uses a USB jack on the box to plug into.For the PCI-E performance, I don't have too many issues with this. I think performance on a full PC would be better, but as an EGPU, I have no complaints at all.Some details about my day to day use of this.My OS is Manjaro Linux, I use an AMD Radeon 580 GTS, I use 2 4k TVs and a 1080p monitor (No screen tearing or lag with this setup)."", 'Works great for macOS and usb works. Ethernet requires a driver from the power color website.Could not for the life of me get the USB ports to show up on windows 10 though. Spent probably 20 hours on it tweaking drivers etc with no luck. Reached out to powercolor and they offered nothing besides get a replacement. Got a replacement and it also doesn’t show up.After tons of research the board inside is flashed the same as the discontinued Mantiz Venus egpu. The difference is that the MV has driver support and is flashable  to newer firmware that allows use of the ports on windows. Powercolor has no support for such a thing. Also the power supply and main pcie board are literally identical to the sonnet egpu. I had both at the time to check.I am extremely bummed because I was wanted to use the SATA port and usbs for a more seamless single cable experience. Sonnets website claims that they didn’t add the USB ports because of “issues”. Maybe these are those issues.So for macOS gaming on inferior amd cards this is the box. For windows you can technically get the cards to work just not the extra ports... which was my whole point in getting this over the sonnet one.', ""I installed a Radeon 5700XT and hooked it up to a new Mac Air and a Macbook Pro via the Thunderbolt 3 port and it works fantastic gaming on both Air and Pro laptops and getting 2k at 144 FPS no lie with an external GPU it will turn most anything system into a gaming rig. The only requirement is having a Thunderbolt 3 port available. I loaded up Steam and Origins and was very happy on the playability on the Mac's. A little hot but that the external case doing it's job of heat dissipation. No issues with the Mac's or the external GPU setup. Very happy. Now have a gaming dock anywhere. It does weight a bit and about the same size as a Shuttle ITX system.  Or the size of a shoe box."", ""As for gaming performance, this thing is great. You get most of the performance of whatever GPU you put in it depending on how well your laptop supports it and what sort of resolution/frame rates you are expecting. The real problem with this device is the USB ports. They are awful. Forget plugging any peripherals in. You will get massive delays and jumpiness. As for any USB audio, you will get horrible interference. If you're alright with just using this for the GPU and ethernet port, 100% recommend, otherwise, not really."", 'I have a Thinkpad X1 Extreme (six core i7-8750, 32 gigs of memory, 1tb NVME,) with the TB3 running through a PCH chip that likes to get hot. In the eGpu is a 1tb SSD drive and an MSI 1080 TI, and I am running games on my 32"" ultrawide at Ultra settings without an issue. The only hiccup is that I have to use a laptop cooling pad to keep the internals cool, otherwise, the PCH chip gets to hot and the FPS will jump around a little. Aside from that, worth its weight in gold. I have an insane laptop, that I can just pick up and go, sit on the couch, go outside, and then come home and play triple-A titles at 4k without issue.', 'Works well with MacBooks and Thunderbolt3 equipped ThinkPads.Please note that your laptop MUST have 4 PCIe Gen3 attached to Thunderbolt.

It had served me well at the time, but over time, I found an increasing number of video games that I wanted to play that it wasn't capable of running. I finally decided to bite the bullet and upgrade to a new video card this year. After a very long search for a video card that was superior to the 740, but that still cost under $100, I decided on this GT 1030.I used websites such as GameDebate and PCGameBenchMark to help me make sure that it would run the games I like best. This is highly recommended because it saves a ton of time over searching for sites about each individual game to read the system requirements.Will it run the very latest games that just came out? Not all of them, but it will run a few of the ones I'm interested in. For example, it'll run Valorant and Fortnite, even on recommended settings, which came out very recently. It'll run almost anything made before 2018 except for notoriously high system requirement games like the Far Cry series (which it can kinda handle on low settings). Most of the games I enjoy the most are older games anyway, so this is a good choice for me.Update: Since I wrote the initial review, I have upgraded my processor from an Intel Core i3 3.4 GHz to a Core i5 2.8 GHz. I was getting good performance from the GeForce GT 1030 before, but games run even better now with this better processor working with it. If you have a processor that's even better than an i5, you'll likely notice and even better gaming performance than I do. I've noticed that many of the games that I tried the card with before where it only did just okay, now play noticeably better. Upgrading the processor hasn't given this video card any new abilities that it lacked before, of course, but it takes some of the processing stress of the video card allowing it to do a better job of what it can do.I realize that it would also be helpful to list the system specs of what I'm running this video card on: Windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit, ASRock H55M-LE motherboard, 8 GB DDR3 RAM, Core i5 2.8 GHz processor (which will go up to 3.1 GHz when it needs to), 650 Watt Corsair power supply (a bit over-kill now since this video card has actually lower power requirements than my GeForce GT 740 had), 1TB Western Digital hard drive, Antec Nine Hundred case with all fans installed, Razer Cortex used on games that support it. With a 'legacy' system like this, the sub-$100 GT 1030 makes sense as an upgrade since it takes the system much closer to its performance limits so that gaming on it will be more fun without costing so much that I can't afford to get a new motherboard, RAM, etc. down the road for a more drastic upgrade.The card itself is surprisingly small for something that's more capable than the bigger GT 740. It is thinner and a little shorter than the GT 740. It also doesn't need you to plug in a power cable into the end of the card itself as it is more energy efficient and gets all the power it needs through the PCI express slot provided that you have a good enough power supply. You need at least a 300 Watt power supply for it. I have a 650 watt PSU, which is more than enough.The small size gives it more room for air flow in most cases. Some video cards today are so huge that they'll barely fit, even in a big ATX mid-tower case. This card has plenty of room in my Antec Nine Hundred case (which is excellent by the way, if you can still find one). This video card only takes up one slot on the motherboard, so if you want to install another card such as a sound card, in a PCI slot near the video card, there's plenty of room for it.The GT 1030 runs very quietly and coolly. It doesn't increase the fan noise of my computer at all. I use Piriform's Speccy program to monitor my PC and even when I've been playing a graphics intensive game like Diablo III for an hour or two, this card isn't even close to exceeding its maximum temperature threshold of 96 degrees C.It sports two DVI ports which let you hook up monitors and display at up to 7680×4320@60Hz resolution.  I use it on twin Acer K202 HQL monitors running at 1600 x 900 @60 Hz resolution with no problems. Just be sure to get DVI cables with narrow frames around their plugs. If you can't find one that has narrow enough plugs, you can trim off the plastic frame on either side of the actual metal male DVI plug to make room without damaging the cable.It's not the prettiest video card I've ever seen, but it is quite capable for the price range and is a great choice for computer cases that are not very roomy."", 'If you don\'t need a top of the line video card for gaming, this is an excellent choice. It\'s a quality card and is far superior to the two prior cards I had previously mounted in my old Dell 980 (EVGA Nvidia GT 610 and GT 630).I purchased the GT 1030 card because I wanted to eliminate the digital breakup I was experiencing whenever I streamed movies. But once it arrived I ran into a big problem. It would not fit into the mounting slot on my PC. Why? Because the heat sink for the CPU and the PS2 connection box were getting in the way. However, after studying the problem for a while I realized that if I modified the plastic casing on the card I could get it to fit.Luckily, this card was a return that I purchased from Amazon at a great price. So, I decided it was worth the gamble, knowing full well that if something went wrong I wasn\'t going to be able to return it.(Please note, this modification will void the warranty for the EVGA Nvidia GT 1030 — do it at your own risk.)HOW I MODIFIED THIS CARD TO FIT MY DELL OPTIPLEX 980 MTI knew this video card would work in my Dell 980 Optiplex MT, but I had a problem, the plastic case covering for the card kept it from fitting in the mounting slot.The head of the card would not fit because of the PS2 connection box on the motherboard. On the other end, I had a similar problem where it was striking the heat sink for the PC\'s CPU. My solution? Modify the plastic casing on the video card by cutting it and the card\'s heat sink aluminum blades.How do you do the modification?First, you need to remove the four screws that hold the plastic casing to the GT 1030. They are located on the backside of the card (see pictures). Once you remove them, the case will come loose except for the power connector for the fan. Be careful with the fan\'s power plug, it\'s hard to disconnect from the card but can be done if you use a jeweler\'s slotted screw driver to release it from the mount by pushing on the plastic spring holding it in place. Once it\'s disconnected, you are free to work on the case.You now need to remove the seven screws that hold the fan and the heat sink to the casing. With the plastic case released from the fan and heat sink, you can cut the case in two places removing about two inches of the plastic on each end (see pictures). I used a fine toothed hacksaw to cut the plastic case. I then used a Dremel (rotary tool) with a cutting disc to shorten the heat sink\'s aluminum blades on the back end by about 1 1/2 inches. Cosmetically, the card won\'t look so hot, but the important thing once reassembled it will fit.Reassemble everything in reverse order and then mount the modified case and heat sink back to the card. Once everything is back together mount it in your PC, boot up your computer and update the drivers. Windows automatically updated the drivers to version: 23.21.13.9135 dated: 3/23/2018. I also downloaded and tried the latest drivers from Nvidia, but they caused problems so I just stayed with the ones I had.Important Note:1. The bottom of the aluminum heat sink has ""thermal heat sink compound."" You\'ll need to have some just in case you accidentally remove it as you do the modification. It\'s available here on Amazon. It\'s cheap. When I did this modification, I decided the easiest think to do was to remove the compound and replace it afterwards during the reassembly process. Thermal heat sink compound is used to transfer heat from video card\'s CPU to the aluminum heat sink where the heat is dissipated and cooled by the internal fan.2. The 7 screws you remove from the fan and plastic casing are tiny. You will need a jeweler\'s set of screw drivers in order to remove them. Also, be careful not to lose them as they will easily roll off your work surface.3. The power plug for the fan is difficult to disconnect from the card — be careful when you pry on the tiny plastic spring. If you exert too much force on the connection point you can damage the mounting slot on the card.The GT 1030 has been in my PC for almost a week now and it\'s working flawlessly. I\'ll try update this review in six months.', 'Me a canta que no hace nada pero nada de ruido. Si le pones un ventilador silenciso.

The research took some time because there were many conflicting information regarding whether the card will work with Legacy BIOS or UEFI BIOS only.  I can confirm that this card works well with the XPS 8300.The installation was not without a snag, though. (not sure if it was due to user error or not). In summary, I followed the usually recommended steps of first removing the old driver for the existing graphics card, shutdown, install new graphics card, startup, download/install latest driver for the new graphics card.Somewhere in the process, I was not able to see BIOS boot screen (only saw black screen) after installing the new card. I had to hard shutdown by long-pressing the power button.  This is when the problem starts. Apparently something had caused the RAID-1 array in the XPS 8300 to be in a state where the two drives in the array were not in sync.  The BIOS showed the RAID-1 array was repairing. How I eventually recovered from this was unfortunately not clear.  But, I tried removing the graphics card, and putting the old one in (still working but has loud fan noise), the BIOS showed again. Had also tried the built-in VGA graphics port (covered by plastic tab), etc.Not sure what eventually fixed it.  Took a long time for the RAID-1 array to stability. I also had to run the check disk when Windows 7 come up and suggested that I do that. Eventually managed to get the card up and running.  I noticed a slight improvement with the overall graphics function in the computer.  I don't use the computer for gaming.Overall, I would recommend the card to extend the life of an old computer like my Dell XPS 8300."", ""My work PC was in need of some upgrades. It started out life, about 6 years ago as a very low end office PC , it's an HP 6305 SFF that came with an A4-5300B, 4GB RAM (single channel), and a 500 HDD.  I intially upgraded the CPU to an A8-5500, added another stick of RAM (8GB dual channel), and a low profile Radeon 6570 so I could mess around with AMD's ill-fated Dual Graphics  (APU + discrete GPU) tech. That setup served me well, it did everything I needed to do, and could even handle some light gaming.  Given the age of the unit, I figured I was due for a replacement sooner rather than later,  but unfortunately,  I was informed that desktop replacements were not coming for the foreseeable future, and what we got is what we're going to have for a while now.  Another round of upgrades were in order.  I considered the RX 550, but the low profile models were $30 more than the GT 1030 and it's performance is about the same, a low profile GTX 1050, which was significantly faster, but nearly double the price, and the RX 560 which was also more expensive (and faster) but whose power draw made me nervous (60-80 TDP against a 240 watt PSU).  So the 1030 GT it was, very low power draw, and a big performance upgrade over the old 6570.  I also added an SSD, along with another 8GB (2x4GB) of RAM from some discarded desktops and now I've taken this thing about as far as it can go for the most part.  The GT 1030 is about as fast as old GTX 460, which isn't much by today's standards, but it handles most older games and Source-based games just fine, even at 1080p.  It's not going to handle new AAA titles with any grace or dignity, but for $70, it's an ideal upgrade for older office PC."", ""The graphic card was very easy to install. Now I don't recommend this card if you can afford a 1050ti 4gb. However, if you're on a very tight budget and need a gpu or want a better one, I do recommend this. Since Fortnite and Genshin Impact are decently popular I'll use it as my reference for graphics. Something important to also mention my CPU is i5 6500. With fortnite it ran the game 1080p with frame rate unlimited all other settings at their lowest and vsync off at 50-90fps. It runs on Genshin with 1080p at all highest settings other than render resolution being at 1.0 and shadows being at low, with about 30-60fps other than in dragon spine, dragon spine with the same settings is about 10-20fps. I've been happy with this card so far, it's done the job for me while I wait to earn enough money to actually buy a new PSU and PC case to support a better GPU and money for the better GPU itself."", ""I recently acquired an older Dell Optiplex i5-3470 SFF PC that was being thrown out and converted it to my HTPC connected to an Epson 1080p Projector. To modernize it a bit I dropped in another 4GB of RAM (taking it to 8GB total), a black friday 250GB SSD and this EVGA GeForce GT 1030 SC 2GB GDDR5 Passive, Low Profile using the included bracket so it would fit the SFF case. These upgrades (~$100) have made this feel as responsive as my day to day workstaion (dual xeon e5) and gaming PC (i7+1080ti) in most tasks and admirably when it comes to gaming.Given that the GPU is passively cooled I was very curious to see how it would perform thermally. While periodically checking temps in windows outside of games it was typically around 42-43C. For gaming thermals I ran it through it's paces in Unigine and a few games monitoring the GPU temps & clocks via MSI afterburner using complete factory default settings. Basically until the GPU hits ~83C the GPU core clock stays around 1.7GHz. Upon hitting ~83C it will begin to throttle the GPU clock down to around 1.5-1.6GHz and stay in that range while fluctuating from about 81-83C. Memory clock was pegged at 3GHz and never moved.Anecdotal game experiences:World of Warcraft: At settings 5 and foreground FPS cap set to 66 it held 60+ in most zones while I was testing. In the Auction house and Uldir 45-50 FPS seemed to be the norm. Completely playable.Overwatch: On High at 1080p with render scale set to 100% ~45-50FPS seemed to be the average. On Medium with auto render scale it stayed pegged at 60+In any event for a passively cooled GPU for a budget SFF HTPC this is more than I could have hoped for."", ""Upgraded a TV to 4k, so needed to upgrade something that would stream/display 4k.

Más ruido = mejores temperaturas. En general, con los valores por defecto, la gráfica no se calienta demasiado, aunque siempre configuro que vayan al 100% cuando sube de 60° y el ruido ahí se nota, obviamente.A temperaturas bajas los ventiladores se paran, como las demás gráficas de Gigabyte, es un punto muy a favor aunque muchas gráficas lo hacen.Potencia:Por comparar diré que tiene la misma potencia o incluso más que la 1060 de Nvidia sin utilizar juegos con api vulkan, con juegos con vulkan la Rx580 le da un buen repaso a la 1060. Consume un poco más que la 1060 pero nada alarmante, son consumos normales.Software y drivers:Una auténtica cagada, lo mejor habría sido que no llevase el CD porqué los drivers que vienen ahí no funcionan bien y eso si te deja llegar a instalarlos. Me los bajé de la web y ahí todo perfecto y a la primera, lo iba a hacer de todos modos, pero de primeras lo monté en un sitio sin acceso a Internet. Así que en este punto, respecto a los drivers del CD muy muy mal.Precio:La he comprado por 200e es un choyo sinceramente, más teniendo en cuenta que a día de hoy hay una promoción en la que te regalan dos juegos AAA recién salidos a la venta que valen 60e cada uno.En resumen, podrás jugar a cualquier juego a 1080p 60fps con todo en ultra por 200e (siempre que no haya cuello de botella en otro componente) , se mire por donde se mire es una ganga. Y no hagáis caso a algunos de los comentarios que he leído de este producto, hay gente que comenta sin tener ni idea.Todas las anteriores gráficas que compré han sido de Nvidia, en mi pc de jugar habitualmente tengo una gtx1070, lo comento para que no creáis que soy un fanboy de amd. La Rx580 es una muy buena gráfica por el precio que tiene.', 'Me ha llegado hoy y no he tenido mucho tiempo para probarla, pero lo poco que la he probado me ha encantado. Vengo de 2 RX 580 anteriores, una Sapphire de 4GB y una MSI Armor de 8GB.La Sapphire, a pesar de que tiene muy buena fama, fue una completa basura. Coil Whine brutal, mal rendimiento, temperaturas muy altas...Luego pase a la MSI. Esta funcionaba bien, pero tenia varios problemas. El primero es que no tiene backplate, esta todo al aire, los ventiladores esta atornillados a la placa sin ningun tipo de ""proteccion"". Esto provoca que de su propio peso se doble un monton, provocando daños en la ranura pci de la placa base y en la propia tarjeta de video. El segundo problema era que era tremendamente ruidosa. Pusieras el juego que pusieras, los ventiladores al mas minimo movimiento ya hacian ruido. Como te pusieras a jugar a algo mas o menos exigente, parecia que tu pc iba a despegar.Finalmente, he comprado la Gigabyte (ya tuve una 1050ti de 4GB de esta emsambladora y fue genial, parece que esta va por el mismo camino).Es bastante mas corta que la Sapphire y la MSI (algo que la gente con torres poco espaciosas agraceran), es MUCHO mas silenciosa (he estado jugando en silencio a juegos que con la MSI era un avion a reaccion), no se dobla, tiene luces RGB (que es una chorrada, pero se agradece) y cuenta con un led que te indica si le falta energia para funcionar.Si no le pongo 5 estrellas es porque solo trae un hdmi (que si, que se puede comprar un adaptador dvi o displayport, pero la msi por ejemplo si traia 2 hdmi) y porque el precio sigue estando muy alto. Actualizare si tengo algun problema con la tarjeta, pero de momento, como he dicho, todo muy bien. Estoy muy contento, Gigabyte es una muy buena ensambladora.', 'Le he puesto cinco estrellas y, sin embargo, estoy algo apenado con la compra. Lo explico, la tarjeta es muy buena y potente y por eso se merece las cinco estrellas, no obstante, cuando la vi por primera vez estaba en unos 174€ pero Amazon empezó a escalarle el precio inmediatamente hasta los 267€ que me costó a mi o los 287€ creo que vale ahora. Yo la compré para un centro de estudios donde se imparten clases avanzadas de programas de diseño asistido por computador, con lo cual la intención era comprar un número considerable de unidades para renovar gran parte de los equipos pero debido a este incremento de más de 100€ he tenido que considerar otras opciones y aunque sigo necesitando más unidades si Amazon sigue con este precio, simplemente no podré adquirirlas aquí muy a mi pesar.En lo que respecta a la gráfica va estupendamente incluso en operaciones de texturizado, simulación dinámica o renderizados exigentes. Respecto a juegos no la he probado pero estoy seguro que los mueve sin problemas.En definitiva, mi primer gran decepción con Amazon porque si quiero comprar aquí 10 ó 12 tarjetas me supone un desembolso de unos 1200€ más que respecto al precio original. En resumen, si no os importa pagar 287€ por esta tarjeta, es una gran compra en lo que a resultados se refiere. Decir también que en lo relativo a embalaje, rapidez, etc, Amazon impecable como siempre.Actualizo:Después de unos pocos meses de uso en diseño CAD, de repente ha dejado de responder. He contactado con Amazon y amable y ágilmente me han reembolsado el importe.Tengo también otras tres tarjetas similares de Gigabyte, una RX570 y dos RX590. Estas últimas son las que estoy probando más a fondo a ver si fallan también, en cuyo caso pensaré que es un fallo generalizado de Gigabyte. Si siguen bien, es para pensar que ha sido un fallo puntual de la RX580.Pasado un tiempo más comentaré cómo va.', 'Man kann für diesen Preis im Moment (Stand Januar 2019) wohl keine leistungsstärkere Grafikkarte bekommen. Wer also seinen PC wieder updaten muss, ist mit der RX 580 8GB sehr gut beraten.Lediglich die Lüfter auf der Grafikkarte sind leider extrem laut, sodass man sich auf einen hohen Geräuschpegel oder ein Schalldämmendes Gehäuse einstellen sollten.', 'Produit très certainement génial mais à ne jamais combiner avec la carte mère Gigabyte B450M !Malgré les dires de Gigabyte, Configomatic ou encore Amazon, ne jamais combiner les deux: la compatibilité est aléatoire. Autrement dit, ça passe ou ça casse...', 'Buena gráfica para lo que me costo(encima viene con dos juegos de regalo),mueve los juegos actuales a 1080p con todo en ultra a 60 FPS sin despeinarse,la he probado con juegos como el ultimo Tomb Raider y con juegos como como Gears of War 4 y otra serie de juegos,UN DETALLE IMPORTANTE: no valláis a instalar el software Aurus engine desde la pagina de Gigabyte por culpa de este software estuve apunto de devolver la la gráfica,este software tiene un bug que hace que los juegos no pasen de 15 FPS,según todos los test que se le pueden hacer a la gráfica funciona bien pero con el aurus engine instalado dan una puntuación muy baja,cuando estaba a punto devolverla ley a un usuaria que comentaba lo del programa y lo probe y resulta que ese era el fallo.Por ultimo decir que para que me enviaran el código de los juegos tuve que llamar a atención del cliente de amazon porque no recibía el coreo con el código.', 'Pues no tenia mucha confianza en amd rx 580 pero madre mia como va!!!! es mejor que la 1060 apenas hace ruido, juego en 1.080p a tope incluso a 2k y la e probado en 4k en lol y todo en ultra ,asi que para los juegos que no sean exigentes tira en 4k , para otros juegos en 2k y 1.080p a tope ,es muy estetica los leds ayudan a verla a traves del cristal , apenas hace ruido ,no se calienta nada ,tengo una curva personalizada del 10% a la temperatura, por ejemplo; al 40grados 50%ventilador , a 50grados  60% vebtilador y asi va genial , tengo que decir que el precio siempre puede mejorar pero para lo que vale tienes una 1060ti  o 1070 asi le llamaria yo ,porque rinde mejor que una 1060 ademas se puede hacer oc con el programa facilemente para mejorarla un poco aunque no hace falta .para los que le han salido rana simplemente descambienla por otra precintada porque no hace nada de ruido.', 'Erstmal zur Grafikkarte kann man für knapp 200€ kaum was Besseres bekommen. Leise brauche ich hier wohl nicht erwöhnen da im Ide die Lüfter aus sind und bei niedriger Drehzahl auch kaum hörbar sind. Die Leistung reicht für mich locker aus, die Karte bringt fast überall 60 fps auf mittleren oder bei etwas älteren Spielen sogar hohen Grafikeinstellungen. Bezüglich der LED-Beleuchtung kann ich nichts sagen denn ich habe ein Modell bekommen welches weder Logo mit Hintergrundbeleuchtung, noch die metallene Backplate besitzt. Und da gehen wir dann auch schon zu meiner Kritik am Support über.Ich habe dem Support freundlich mein Problem geschildert, dass ich ein Modell bekommen habe ohne metallener Rückenplatte und LED-Logo (auch bekannt als Rev. 2) und dass ich ein Modell mit eben diesen Merkmalen erwartet habe weil es so auf den Produktbildern angegeben wurde. Chat verlief problemlos, man bot mir schnell an, die Karte umzutauschen. Soweit so gut, nur dass eben diese Karte genau die selbe Karte ohne LED-Logo und Backplate ist. Naja, die Leistung bleibt die selbe, ist nur die Optik, daher gebe ich mich dann wohl zufrieden mit der Karte, bevor ich wieder 4 Tage auf die gleiche Karte warte.', 'Ich betreibe diese Gigabyte RX580 in einem AMD 7850K Rechner mit Gigabyte Motherboard. Sie passt gerade so in mein Towergehäuse und das 6+2-Pin Kabel welches beim Rechner dabei war, passte um die Karte mit 8-pin an mein Netzteil mit 8-pin anzuschliessen. Da mein Gehäuse ""durchlöschert"" ist, sieht man schemenhaft auch den beleuchteten Schriftzug ""Gigabyte"" hindurch. Wie erwartet ist die Karte flüsterleise im normalen (2D) Betrieb, also beim arbeiten, Surfen, mailen, etc. In meinem Silentmaxx quasi lüfterlosen Rechner unterm Tisch ist sie praktisch nicht zu hören (im Gegensatz zu günstigen Grafikkarten im Büro).Bei 3D Spielen beginnt aber nach kurzer Zeit der Lüfter zu drehen. Selbst bei so grafisch einfachen 3D Spielen wie ""AER memories of old""  drehen die Lüfter so laut auf, daß es unerträglich wird, wenn man nicht einen entsprechend lauten Sound zum Spiel hat. Immerhin passt sich der Lüfter relativ langsam an und heult nicht so eklig auf wie bei den Rechnern bei uns im Büro. Das Ganze wird unter Ubuntu16.04 LTS mit einem 3440x1440 Monitor betrieben. Benchmarks:Unigine Heaven 4.0 (3440x1440): 36.7 avergae FPSUnigine Superposition 1.0 (1080p): 6481 Punkte (und damit gleichauf mit diversen NVIDIA Titan), avg FPS 48.48Karten!)Fazit: das Teil ist richtig schnell (wesentlich schneller als meine alte RX460) aber beim 3D Spielen leider auch sehr laut - ohne Kopfhörer oder laut aufgedrehten Boxen ist der Lärm viel zu groß, daß man es einfach ignorieren könnte. Schade - der Lärm kostet die Karte 3 Sterne! Denn für den Nicht-Spiele-Betrieb genügt auch eine schwächere passiv gekühlte Karte.', 'Si estáis buscando una tarjeta gráfica que gire en torno a los 200€ y queréis que sea versátil (multimedia, render, juegos...), la RX 580 es vuestra elección. En este caso, tenía un poco de miedo por las temperaturas que sacaría, pero tengo que decir que Gigabyte lo ha hecho genial, ya que sacaba una temperatura de 30-35 grados en reposo a unos 20-22 grados exteriores.Además, tiene lucecitas RGB en el dorso, por lo que si tenéis caja acristalada donde se pueda ver el interior, está genial.  Para que os hagáis una idea, la rival de esta gráfica es la GTX 1060 de 6GB, una gráfica que vale 150€ más aproximadamente.Un precio insuperable y una calidad muy alta. Le doy lo que se merece: 5/5.']"

I\'ve drilled a 1/8"" hole in a 2"" diameter disc of plastic and placed it in the center of the diode to overcome this problem. I secured it in that position with 100% silicone  caulking but I still have a problem but not with arcing. These diodes are rated at 10 ma but 15 kv RMS x 1.414 =  a peak AC voltage of 21.21 kv.  I have a high voltage 2 meg ohm resistor in series with the diode and it charges a high voltage capacitor.  This produces a short lived peak current that slightly exceeds 10 ma and I see some heating effects on the diode.  Perhaps this is just the silicone heating up to give a little smoke. Time will tell.

This is not how I like to receive electronics.', ""After 4 years of talking myself out of buying a Quadro - I finally broke down and selected this beautiful balance of OpenGL brilliance. The PASCAL series is excellent technology - but, I was shocked at the speed of this card. (Very smooth transitions - video capture/editing; excellent OpenGL support in rendering and simulation software). I'm currently test-driving the newest Blender software.I use Solid Edge / Works extensively (which I consider both a parametric-marvel) - and, I needed to get pass the ridiculous hang-ups that I was experiencing while working with large files with face sets during surface modeling (not always a memory issue!).In Solid Edge, I try to avoid using the Sweep command; I'll practice the 'built-in' face-set command and grab the face/profile of objects (which is excellent for piping systems and merging complex walls / boundaries). However, the GTX card's limited OpenGL functions are obvious after about the 50th face-set down the tree. My advanced files used to require that I disable the 'shaded with lines' command - because the lines (vectorization) require extensive OpenGL resources and memory (which causes the detail to suffer a little; bad stuff for surface modeling)Quadro is designed for accuracy, detail, and heavy vector calculation; GTX is designed for shooting things at 100 frames/secondOpenGL support is premium - and, the Quadro card will unlock drivers (OpenCL) for those looking to develop their own software (i.e. Blender, 3Ds Max)INTEL 6700k (liquid cooled)ASUS Z170 SabertoothSamsung Pro 950 (with Windows 10 Pro); make sure you have the latest Samsung NVMe drivers installed (Windows will install generic)16GB DDR4 - 3000 MHz - Crucial Ballistix Elite memory (I used this stable and durable profile in all my systems)Nothing else really matters - this is a very efficient system with a Quadro Pascal card***If you switch from GTX to Quadro - make sure you grab the Quadro drivers and make the appropriate settings in your software (OpenGL will need to be set manually in NVidia control panel) - beautiful things will unfold. Also, try to match your CPU and Memory speed to a synchronous value (i.e. 2133cpu & 2133memory) - ***UPDATE: synchronous is a reference to stability and accuracy of data - not normally associated with overclocking (in professional use)"", 'Satisfied with the card but after 4 years the fan started to emit an extremely annoying continuous screech.  For this amount of money, that is irritating.  Update:  After removal and thorough cleaning with canned air it screeched for a little while longer, but then quietened down and is silent again - thank goodness.  I hope it stays that way.', ""Incredible! I'm not a techie when it comes to video cards, but the P4000 was able to run Minecraft + OptiFine + Wisdom Shaders with MAX settings on AMD Ryzen 7. What I understand is anti-aliasing and rendering (shadow and lighting) is resource intensive.The time it takes to render projects in AfterEffects, Blender, and SolidWorks has also been cut in half after upgrading from EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB. For the price and performance, you really can't go wrong. The question comes down to if you need powerful graphics for what you do or do you want to save by buying a card that's not overkill and does what you need at a fraction of the cost.

It can be purchased with mini-DP to HDMI adaptors or a mix from other vendors. The standard adapters are 4 of the mini-DP to DP adapters.  As a note, the audio output can be a bit odd with it sending too strong of a signal to a system with a rear speaker setup making them WAY too loud.  This is a Nvidia driver software issue more than a hardware problem though and can be fixed with some creative settings tweaking between the Nvidia and Windows drivers to get it right. Another odd thing with the Nvidia drivers is that, as a default, it limits the color range to that of a HMDI television for each connected monitor. If you are using monitors and not TVs, you must go into each connected monitor's settings and change the color range to: FULL 0-255. Doing this will help make the display colors pop more and the contrast will also be quite improved.

This card won the battle with me after far too many hours of battle. Let\'s start with what worked and go from there.I have four AOC monitors plugged into the card via 4 ""passive"" Mini DP to HDMI cables. My system is an AMD FX-8320 based machine in case anyone cares. I am not a gamer, this machine is used exclusively as an engineering workstation. As others will tell you, this is not a high end gaming card but it is more than qualified for most non-gaming and will work fine for less intensive games.Installation was the same as any other video card I have installed. Open the case, find the PCIex16 slot and plug it in, power on and wait for Windows to do it\'s thing, then go in and install the NVIDIA drivers from the disk. Everything went as expected and within a few minutes, I had all four monitors lit up with a nice crisp display. The card performance was much better than my old GT730 card on video and fast moving graphics. The difference wasn\'t life changing, but it was detectable. I was very happy with four monitors from a single card so I used the card all day without any issues. At this point I would have rated this card five stars but continue reading to see what happened.I came in to work the next morning only to discover that my monitors were still on and the PC did not enter sleep mode. The screens were blank, but the backlight was on and the power indicator LED\'s were green (not amber) so it was clear there was a problem before I even touched my PC. I proceeded to wiggle the mouse to wake it up and all four monitors sprung to life. I checked all of the usual screen saver settings and timeout settings and everything was fine. I changed them to 1 minute to test and sure enough, the screens went blank but did not power off so the problem was repeatable. From this point I ran the powercfg /requests at an elevated command prompt and is showed my USB camera and the sound card were active and possibly preventing sleep mode, so I unplugged them and ran the command again and it showed that the system was clear to enter sleep mode. After one minute, the screens went blank but did not power off, same as before. I was at a loss so I contacted NVIDIA and they spent 2 hours with me reloading all the drivers and reconfiguring everything with no success. They said they believed the card was defective and I should contact PNY and return it. PNY was a complete waste of time to deal with. I provided the entire transcript of all that I had done and the first response I got from them after 2 days was, ""Do you have your screen saver set up correctly?"" (Seriously! Wow!) Anyway, I played the game for 3 more rounds of email, each take a day or more to get a response. I reminded them that I provided the transcript so they knew what else was tested to avoid rework but they didn\'t seem to want to read it or help so I decided to do one final test on my own.I moved the card over to another PC I had in the office and set it up. This machine was an AMD-6300 based machine with a completely different motherboard. It had nothing but a clean copy of Windows, Mouse and Keyboard connected so it was a good test subject. I fired it up and it behaved exactly the same, blank screens that did not power off. From this I could only conclude there was either a defect in the card or the drivers preventing the PC from turning off the screens or entering sleep mode, I relayed this information back to PNY and would you believe they just asked if I had my screen saver setup right again! Luckily for me, I was still within the return window for Amazon, so I just returned the card and went back to my old configuration with the G-force GT-730 card and everything is working normally again. My motherboard had a second video card slot so I added an old G-Force GT-620 card there and to my amazement, they are both working without any issue at all. They are slightly lower performance on fast moving video, but work flawlessly for watching movies or streaming video so as far as I am concerned, I am happy and will not be trying to replace the Quadro P600 card.So my review is best broken down as follows.Video card in use ...................... 5 starsVideo card at rest ...................... 0 starsNVIDIA support ......................... 4 StarsPNY Support ............................. 1 StarsHope this review helps someone else that might be experiencing a similar issue. You are not crazy if your PC will not sleep after installing this card.', 'First let me say that the rating of this review does not reflect the capabilities of the card and I am only making this review so you can avoid the problem I ran into. The reason I cannot review this card properly is because the one I received turned out to be defective and had to send it back. So, I wanted to share my experience here and am not sure what would be a fair rating so I gave it 4 stars because I do not think I should down rate the product just because mine was defective yet, my experience was negative so I cannot give it 5 stars.I use TVs for monitors in my office (see attached) and I needed a graphics card that can drive my new\xa0\nSamsung UN65MU8500 Curved 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV\n\xa0so I purchased this card along with 4\xa0\nMini DisplayPort to HDMI Cables\n\xa0and was waiting for the TV to be delivered. When I got the TV, I installed the card and used one of the cables but I got no video. I used an older DP to HDMI cable that I had and got video on the TV but after Windows installed the drivers and asked for a restart, my PC would no longer boot. I would have no video and the hard drive led would not even blink once. Now, I know you are thinking this was a windows drivers issue but it is not because I would not even get the BIOS prompts. Using my old nVidia card I updated the BIOS and made sure all settings are correct but could not get passed this problem with the new card.I guess my point here is that you should avoid these\xa0\nMini DisplayPort to HDMI Cables\n\xa0with this card because they will not work (at least on a 4k TV). I ended up getting a Radeon RX 560 card from a local store which has an HDMI output and worked right away with no problems and has been working great since. I returned the Quadro card along with the 4 cables but I still think that this Quadro card would have been a better fit for my needs compared to the Radeon RX 560 and they were both at the same price range.', 'I got this specifically to work as a hardware media transcoder on my server. For what I paid, it is an amazing powerhouse. Yes, there are cards that can have unlimited streams at once, but also cost 10x as much. This can do multiple 4k streams at once, no problem. Unless you have a need for 13 streams, you get a Titan GTX. Otherwise, absolutely best bang for your buck.', 'This card was a pain in the canary to set up.  I\'m running Win 10 Home in a Dell desktop.  First, the card only comes with mini DP to DP adapters, so plan on buying cables.  Second, the CD that came with it didn\'t auto boot, or boot at all.  I dug down through the tree to find the driver.exe file and install it.  Third, the driver.exe failed.  So tried again and did an Advanced install of just the basic driver.  That sort of worked.  At least I could see my screen now.  Contacted NVIDIA chat customer service and the front line assistant lasted 4 lines of exchange before booting me to India and second tier customer service.  Okay, he got me up and running, but now my splitter didn\'t work anymore.  Busted back to front line customer service was told ""NVIDIA doesn\'t recommend the use of splitters with their product.""  Well, I need to have one of my screens echoed to a big screen TV so others in the room can watch what I\'m doing, and I need all four of the outputs of the card for 4 monitors.  Got offline and played around a bit with cables and discovered that a ""Cable Matters Mini DisplayPort to HDMI / DVI / VGA (Mini DP to HDMI / DVI / VGA Male to Female 3-in-1 Adapter in White - Thunderbolt / Thunderbolt 2 Port Compatible-Supporting 4K Resolution via HDMI"" adapter that I had purchased so that I could test and diagnose older monitors must be what they call an ""active DP"" thingy and by running my signal through there to the splitter, it now works just fine!  NVIDIA always makes me nervous so in the future I\'m going back to Radeon.  For the extra $30 I could have gotten a twice as fast card and I\'ve never had problems with their cards in 30 years.  Would guess they would have known about and suggested the ""active DP"" thingy rather than just telling me something just wont work.  Anyway, the picture is good now.  But if I discover any more limitations to this card in the next week, it\'s going back.', ""This was purchased for a friend who thinks they control the Matrix (just kidding).  My friend is extremely talented at multitasking and cannot survive without a 4 monitor setup.  (Seriously who needs more than 2 monitors.... again kidding... sort of).  This was a forced purchase to replace a very expensive ATI FirePro 2650 card.  ATI stopped supporting this card in 2015 and because of this doesn't work as well with the new Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (blue screen and reboot).  Microsoft may fix this in the future, but this is no way to run a business, and my friend could not wait.  This has a lot of advantages over the FirePro.  For one, Mini DisplayPort are clearly numbered vs the VHDCI to DVI solution ATI chose.  The ATI cables kept getting loose and mixed up, causing resolution problems and the icons to be rearranged frequently.  The Nvidia Quadro's MiniDP are very tight and do not fall out or come loose.  The first thing noticed even without the drivers being installed was that the 2d images and text were definitely crisper and more vibrant than the ATI.  The fan is very quiet and the power draw is very low.  The box comes with 4 MiniDP male to HDMI female adapters about 2-3 long each and a low profile bracket preinstalled.  The full size slot bracket needs to be installed manually.  My friend decided to go with 10ft Mini DP male to HDMI male cables to simplify things."", 'The video card works perfectly on my Lenovo Workstation running Windows 10 (1903). The only caveat is that I needed to purchase four video cables for my particular installation since the supplied cables are not compatible with most older displays that with VGA, Digital or HDMI. Other than that the entire installation took about 30 minutes with the longest part of the install being that Windows 10 initially only recognized one video port. Once I ran an internet driver update, one by one the other three monitors came up. One other thing to note is that even though I plugged the monitors in and set them up in the order displayed on the video card itself that is not how they appear with the Operating System.  The video card has the ports listed as 1 2 3 4 but for me port 1 is actually monitor 2 and port 2 is actually monitor 1. Port 3 is actually monitor 4 and port 4 is actually monitor 3. Windows allows you to easily reorder the displays so no biggie with that, but one would think that plugging the monitors into the ports as they are labeled and then placing them on the desk in that order that they would come up that way, but sadly... No. Other than that the displays look fantastic for my use which is mixed business. I hope this helps.', ""I have three Quadros cards, all different manufacturers and models. All of the cards work flawlessly on both Linux and Windows machines across a wide range of display formats. These cards typically run under 40C when idle and I've yet to see mine past 50C. Very little noise compared to larger cards. I used to run GeForce line of cards but that was a mistake.If you don't care about achieving 300fps in the most cutting-edge video games then you should probably get a Quadro card. Much less heat and noise. The 4x mini-DP out is extremely convenient for multi displays and saves a lot of cable clustering issues. Since Quadro cards typically have 4 outputs and can stack very easily due to their size you should have no issues with display output count, which makes daisy chaining unnecessary."", 'Will work for small form factor and full tower PCs. Good performance. SLI compatible assuming the rest of your system is as well. I am running two of these in my workstation', 'NVIDIA Quadro P600NVIDIA Consistently delivers a great product at a reasonable price, this enables you to grow into it with high quality monitors as one gets more proficient at utilizing the advantages of digital quality images etc.This particular Video Card has 4 digital outputs (High Definition) and Supports up to four HDMI 4K displays simultaneously.

A major upgrade to the Nvidia NVS 310 that came from factory. Solidworks no longer lags upon every move. We also added RAM prior to the card which helped marginally as well. I would say this card is a minimum for Solidworks if you dealing with assemblies over 10 small parts. Load times improved, crashes lessened, and imaging sped up. For the money invested this works great for our situation, while not flawlessly we also didn't put $1000 GPU into a $2000 workstation. I believe the p1000 would net gains above the p600 but the price tag is above too.""]"

Miners, this card is not for you.  Please look elsewhere and inflate the prices of other cards!I would say a rather resounding ""YES!"" with a few caveats that this card still do make sense to some.... please read on.This old AMD Radeon Pro WX7100 is currently a direct competition to the newer Nvidia Quadro P4000.  They are both single slot professional cards that are currently (mid March 2018) the fastest offered by each competing manufacturer.Two myths I have gladly debunked.1. Professional graphic cards are not good for gaming.  Nonsense!  The WX7100 absolutely rocks for casual gamers for classics like Starwars Battlefield at ultra settings etc. on default professional drivers.  AMD also made it easy to switch to gaming drivers easily!  You do have to manage your expectations as it is not a Vega 64 or Titan X class monster.  But comparing this to a GTX960 which it replaced, I am rather impressed with the decent frame rates.2. Professional graphic cards have the same display quality as gaming cards.  There is a noticable difference!  This is where this card really shines.  There are various customisations for the perfect display on whatever the monitor or TV screen you hook the card to.  I use this with a Samsung TV with a HDMI to DP adaptor and the display quality is outstanding after tweaking.  Movies played with VLC looked so much better with blacks showing more dynamic range.  Text are very much easier to read too!A few things I like about the WX7100.1. Modest power consumption.  It uses just a 6-way PCie power supply plug from my HP Z620 workstation with no stress added to the PSU.2. Single PCie slot.  It is very refreshing to replace a space-hogging double slot graphics card with the WX7100 on a real-estate contrained workstation and yet, you do not compromise on performance.3. It\'s about the software.  AMD creates the drivers that are certified and stable for any use.  I absolutely love the additional configurability not available on consumer cards that allow tweaking of the display for better suitability for any useage.There is only one thing I am irritated about the WX7100.  The single cooling fan on the card spins very loud when rendering in Blender or when playing games.  The noise is noticable coming from within a rather quiet workstation.  I guess this is the compromise for choosing a smaller, single slot card in a fully packed chasis.On paper, the P4000 may be faster in every way and if you require CUDA for your professional needs, AMD cannot be your consideration.  But for OpenGL, the WX7100 is very well equipt to satisfy.With the P4000 currently costing upwards of 50% more than the WX7100, there is yet an additional value proposition when AMD directly provides you with a free 7-year warranty on top of the original 3-year AMD warranty.If you only play games, you don\'t need to pay through your nose with a professional graphics card.  You will be most happy with the best consumer gaming card within your budget.  However, if you use Blender (or any OpenGL apps), love to watch movies with HDR, game occasionally and love a stable and reliable VR-ready display card with a 10-year warranty to boot, this may be the perfect solution for you!In the near future, I will find the opportunity to test this card out with Windows AR and other VR solutions.  Now, where can I get hold of a new VR headset from Samsung (Odessey) or the new Vive Pro?....', ""I have not yet installed the GPU but it is as promised and the vendor was a great help to me regarding shipping which was very fast. Can't wait to get this bad boy installed!"", 'It gave an extra life to my Mac Pro 5,1 mid 2010, super fast.', 'I put this bad butt graphics card in my Sonnet 550 EGPU, connected it to my MBP 13” ‘17 w/Touch Bar 8Gb memory 256 ssd storage; and it connected seamlessly!!!When I use FCPX now, it never crashes! It seems to have done something like quadrupled my rendering time on that (I didn’t try to figure out how much faster it is now exactly)...It was also awesome bc it is Metal compatible!I did not need to download any plugins! It ran right off the bat!I have also used it with Adobe After Effects! I can ACTUALLY USE Ae now! Much much faster + more compatible!I’ve prob had it for about a month now, btw. There have been several times when I have improperly disconnected the EGPU housing and my MBP, but it hasn’t resulted in any noticeable issues other the immediate shutdown of any programs that I was using in which I set them to “prefer external GPU”.So, yes! It’s pretty awesome for video editing and compositing. I don’t know if there are other settings that I need to configure or what, but I am still unable to fully render all of my work in After Effects, but that just may be After Effects for you (I do know that that issue can be arbitrary, but it’s out there for you if you need it)!Anyway, hope that there was something helpful in here for you!', 'La tarjeta funciona bien, muy buena tarjeta grafica, pero llego abierta la caja y la bolsa donde estaba.', ""L'ho utilizzata su di un Mac Pro 5,1 esclusivamente per lavoro di post-produzione fotografica con software specifici di settore (Lightroom, Photoshop, Bridge, ecc....). Piccola, precisa (10 bit), veloce e dai consumi minimi (max 130W). L'ho utilizzata per un anno circa ed ero davvero entusiasta. Purtroppo, non so se per coincidenza o per un difetto della GPU, da una ventina di giorni che ho installato l'ultima versione di Lightroom (2019) a volte si creano degli artefatti (un paio di piccoli rettangoli) sull'immagine durante lo sviluppo del raw. Sia ben chiaro, non so se è un difetto della GPU (la quale mi ha dato tante soddisfazioni) o del software a procurarmi il problema. A tal punto ho contattato Amazon ed ho avuto la possibilità di restituirla comprando una WX 8200 (sorella maggiore) seppur dal costo circa di 2 volte superiore della WX 7100 ma con un'architettura differente sperando in un corretto funzionamento (o compatibilità). Per fortuna tutto ok, funziona!In conclusione, non avendo la certezza che la GPU si fosse guastata, e tenendo presente che ha 10 ANNI DI GARANZIA (nei primi 3 sostituzione diretta), posso dire che la WX 7100 è un'ottima GPU professionale.👍🏻P.S. Grazie Amazon!!!"", 'I bought this for rendering Adobe Premiere video content for a weekly podcast. Without the card the first render was about the same as the video length, basically a 1:11:00 video took 1:11:00 to render.

I am removing one star because of revit perfomance, i was expecting better results over all and it is not compatible with vray for revit. 3 ds max perfomance is great...Edit: I am removing 3 stars due to overheating with twinmotion, it runs fine but obviously the cooler is rubbish. Also, the support is not as i expected from a workstation card. I might have damaged a capacitor or it might have been damaged, honestly i am not sure as i only noticed it when upgrading to a gaming card (rtx 2080)due to overheating in twinmotion. The customer service told me that a damaged hardware is not covered by warranty. Of course, but no one from the customer ever questioned whether it has been damaged from the start or that i might have damaged it...honestly i am dissapointed, the card works as intended, but i have not tried VR or crossfire with it, and i will not. If you ask me now, JUST GET A GAMING CARD. A proffesional card is supposed to have more robust hardware and more extended warranty service.', ""Since AMD updated the WX7100's driver this card has been amazing. They even lowered the price to well under what NVIDIA's competitive product costs. It is not a gaming card but will play games just fine. It can support 4 x 4K screens as well as 5k screens, just less of them. I am very happy with this GPU and would recommend it to anyone looking for a single-slot high-end workstation Graphics Card""]"

It has worked well for me and has handled all my CAD tasks with ease. I was going to go with the P4000 model, but went with this one for two reasons. 1. There is an EK waterblock made for it which allowed me to bring into my custom waterloop and get incredibly low temperatures (around 80F at full load) and it keeps my workstation incredibly quiet. 2. I wanted something that could handle VR for any future systems. Haven't dove into that realm yet, but thought if I do in the next few years, this would be adequate.Update* Been using this with VR, and with a little cable sensitivity (had to try a couple DP to HDMI converters) it works great. Really please with what it can do in the VR world and seems to be well ahead of the curve in regards to hardware demands. Was a little worried when my first DP to HDMI cable was not working and I couldn't get any image, but after reading about this problem I realized my cable wasn't rated for the data transfer and in changing this everything works great.I know there is an argument to go with the gaming card counterparts for half the costs. I had done that before but since I run my workstations really hard, 24/7 and often use remote login, I need that reliability. My last died way too early and I lost a lot of work and productivity. The extra costs for a system that runs reliable is well worth the extra costs in my situation.

Nun ja letzte Woche war es den soweit, und ich habe mir diese Grafikkarte bestellt bei Amazon. Nun ja bevor ich hier richtig los lege erstmal mein System:Prozessor: Intel Core i5 2320Mainboard:  Gigabyte GA-H61M-S2PVArbeitsspeicher: 2 DDR3 Arbeitsspeicher Riegel jeweils 4GBMeine alte Grafikkarte war die GeForce GTX 650Als ich hier bei Amazon nach einer neuen Grafikkarte suchte wollte ich nicht so viel Geld ausgeben. Somit stieß ich auf die GTX 1050ti. Ich hab erstmal geguckt ob man zusätzlich Anschlüsse etc. braucht. Wohlgemerkt ich habe von PCs null Ahnung :D. Naja ich habe ganz ehrlich gesagt nur gelesen Plug & Play, und dachte mir genau das Richtige für mich. Einfach rein stecken, Deckel drauf und anschmeißen die Kiste. Naja dies war nun nicht der Fall aber dazu später mehr. Die Grafikkarte wurde erstaunlich schnell geliefert. Nach 2 Tagen war Sie da. Super dachte ich mir. Hab die Grafikkarte ausgepackt, in mein PC eingebaut und die Kiste angemacht. Und wie hätte das anders sein sollen, der PC startete zeigte kurz das Logo vom Mainboard Hersteller und dann kam einfach ein Blackscreen. Mhh Scheiße dachte ich mir, was machst du jetzt. PC neu gestartet immer noch Blackscreen. Dann habe ich meine alte Grafikkarte eingebaut, startete wunderbar. So dann hab ich hier bei Amazon gelesen, dass es wohl funktionieren sollte wenn man den alten Grafikkarten Treiber deinstalliert. Gemacht getan und immer noch Blackscreen. Tja dann dachte ich mir installierst du den neuen Treiber gleich mit. Also habe ich den neuen installiert und was war immer noch Blackscreen. Dann hab ich die neue GraKa eingebaut und die Seiten Abdeckung von meinem Tower abgenommen, um zu sehen ob sich der Lüfter überhaupt dreht. Der Lüfter dreht fröhlich vor sich her. Danach bin ich davon ausgegangen das es an den Mainboard liegen muss. Womit ich auch im großen und ganzen Recht hatte. Naja ich hab mir gleich ein neues Mainboard gekauft^^. So das Problem an dem neuen Mainboard war aber, dass mein Prozessor da nicht rein gepasst hat. Danach war ich ersmal fertig mit den Nerven ^^. Danach hab ich dann weiter rum gegoogelt hab aber immer noch keine Lösung gefunden. Bis ich dann nach einiger Zeit auf ein Video von einem YouTuber gestoßen bin.Das ältere Mainboards die neuen Grafikkarten nicht erkennen. Abhilfe schaffe da wohl ein BIOS Update des Mainboards. Was aber wohl sehr riskant sei, da bei scheitern des Updates, die Gefahr besteht das der PC dann gar nicht mehr Boostet. Ich dachte mir:""Wer nichts wagt, der nichts gewinnt"". Also habe ich mir von der Gigabyte Seite die entsprechenden Dateien runter geladen bzw. diesen Launcher. Dann hab ich das BIOS Update übers Internet gemacht. Nach ca. 3 min war er damit fertig. Danach hat der PC neugestartet. Zeigte auch ganz zu Anfang, ein ganz anderes Logo als bisher. Danach hab ich mir schon gedacht, vielleicht könnte das jetzt was werden. Gesagt getan, alte Grafikkarte wieder raus neue eingebaut. Und dann bootete der PC ganz normal wie es ein soll. Die Grafikkarte hat er auch sofort erkannt und hat sich die entsprechenden Updates über GeForce Experience runtergeladen. So bis jetzt läuft sie wunderbar.Bisher konnte ich aber leider nur DayZ SA testen. Aber das Ergebnis ließ sich sehn. Auf höchsten Grafik Einstellungen, hatte ich meist so zwischen 40-60 FPS.

Works very well in less demanding titles like the indie games or ones that are a few years old, runs very quiet even during gaming.You can get an RX 570 or GTX 1060 3GB for about the same price atm, but I would need a new PSU and could not even find an adapter for my proprietary mobo power sockets, so opted for the GTX 1050 Ti. Tried an ASRock RX560 at first but it stuttered on all games and video and I found the AMD software a bit 'glitchy' to use i.e. not responding when first opened to Gaming section and found the update always told me I needed to update to the same version of Crimson. Also when I did update it corrupted the software and I had to install it from the new download file.Considering the GTX 1660 6GB is about twice as powerful and can be bought for around £200 then £150 for the 1050 Ti seems a bit much. But if you have limited power (in my case just 200W) then the 1050 Ti is a good option, but now the GTX 1650 is a better 75W PCIe only card and costs about the same price atm.Update 16.05.2020Having done more research it seems I could have gone for the RX570 (120W) or the 1060 (120W) I mentioned. A 200W PSU will be ok with these cards in my OEM system. A system like mine would draw about 185W from the wall with a GTX 1060, so at the PSU after its 20% loss in efficiency it would be about 150W. Just to be sure the GTX 1650 Super (100W) would be a great buy atm. Of course you would need a 6 pin connector from the PSU, my PC has a socket on the MOBO for this purpose."", ""Je regardais différents sites pour l'achat d'une 1050 ti en dessous de 140 euros, quand tout à coup allez savoir pourquoi cette carte Asus s'est affichée à un prix plus bas que d'habitude, prix qui est remonté quelques minutes après, rupture de stock , peu importe, je vais prendre ma chance et je vais patienter quelques jours.Beaucoup de tests montrent que toutes ces cartes 1050 ti se valent, peu importe la marque, ce qui joue ici principalement est la qualité de silence en fonctionnement, je me suis dis (peut être à tord) que prendre une grande marque pour le prix le plus bas était une opportunité à ne pas rater.Tout ce que je sais est que cette carte utilise un roulement à bille pour la rotation de son unique ventilateur et que on ne l'entend absolument pas, elle rempli donc parfaitement cet objectif la ou d'autres selon divers tests sont moins valables à ce niveau.Elle n'est pas OC (overclockée) d'origine mais en vérité cela n'a aucune importance, c'est une manipulation facilement faisable, au final elle sera extrêmement proche de n'importe quelle 1050 ti plus ou moins chères, le silence en plus.Windows 10 met un peu de temps à installer les pilotes de la carte car ils sont énormes, plus de 400 mo chez moi, ce qui choque en comparaison d'une vieille carte graphique, mais patience, il va finir par la reconnaître et l'installer le temps de télécharger le pilote.A noter que je voulais une version alimentée uniquement par la carte mère, je ne voulais pas une usine à consommation mais une carte tout de même suffisamment puissante.Une carte 1050 ti avec PCI Express 6 broches intégré (relié à l'alimentation) présentera un peu plus de possibilités de OC , ou de puissance peut être, mais rien de véritablement très significatif non plus à priori.""]"

The 1050ti is a great GPU for budget gaming builds or when you have a limited power supply. There is no 6 or 8 pin power plug on this card, just plug it into the motherboard and you are done. This bothered me at first, I wasn\'t sure it would be getting enough power. But it turns out that wasn\'t an issue at all. This thing sips power, and if you run the Precision OC or MSI Afterburner software, you will see the GPU cruises at just a couple hundred mhz until it\'s needed for gaming, where it goes close to 1800mhz, and can be overclocked close to 2000 (but I just leave it at the default, it works great). Although this 1050ti SSC has a higher clock speed out of the box than the smaller base model 1050ti cards, if you want to do any extreme overclocking, you may have better results with the 1050ti FTW, which does have a power connector on the card and allows for a higher current draw.Overall, I had excellent results with some of my older games. CS:GO and Skyrim regular edition (no mods) ran at a steady 130-150fps at almost the highest settings, and by turning down things like shadow detail and reducing the anti aliasing, I was able to get the framerate very close to matching the 165hz of my Dell S2417DG monitor at 2560x1440 resolution! That is very impressive, but they are older games so high framerates are expected. I tried the new DOOM game, which is well optimized from what I understand. at 1080p settings, I was getting a steady 60fps on fairly high settings. The trick with this card is to know where to compromise. If you want Ultra quality at 4k with the newest games at a high frame rate in 2017, this card isn\'t for you. But with a couple video settings tweaks, you can really get some nice looking performance from this 1050ti SSC.As of the time of this review, 1060 and 1070 GPUs are still greatly overpriced, and the jump to a GTX 1080 is pretty steep if you are trying to build a ""budget"" gaming PC. Once 1060 prices come back down to earth, that may be a better option, but for now I have been very impressed with the 1050ti. For 1080p gaming, I would recommend it for any budget build. I do want to note that I was using an i5-6600k (not overclocked) and I never saw my CPU pegged at 100% during these tests. If you decide to use something like a G4560 CPU (which is amazing for the price), you may not get quite the same performance on some games, depending on how CPU dependant they are. I apologize for not being able to test this card with a slower processor, all I had available was my Z170 motherboard and the i5-6600, and I\'m also running 16gb G.SKILL 3000mhz ram and a Corsair gold rated 550w power supply. Fairly hefty specs, but as I mentioned earlier, I didn\'t want to pay double the price of this 1050ti for a GTX1060 6gb. This GPU gives great performance for the price, and I\'m very impressed with it so far.', ""ProsPrice4GB of DDR5 Dedicated Video RAMNicely PackagedIncredible GraphicsQuiet (I got the single fan one)ConsNot sure I found any but if you want dual monitors be prepared to use different cables for each monitor or I suppose purchase some sort of Y cable for either DVI, Display Port or HDMI port.  This Card only has one connector for each of these cables which for me is not an issue.Review -I received this card two (2) days ago and I promptly installed it and test it. I work in IT so I didn't need to read the instructions but it comes with a Display Driver Disk, a little installation instruction manual, a quick start fold out sheet and a pretty fancy metal sticker.  All documentation comes in English, German, Spanish, French, Portuguese and 3 different Asian languages (I am guessing they are Japanese, Korean and Chinese).I didn't have to change my power supply since mine is able to handle 450Watts but you should know you would need at least a 300Watts Power Supply.  In fact, before you buy any Video Card you should go to the manufacturer and see what it requires and adjust accordingly (either buy a new Power Supply or buy a different card).  However, I don't know any systems that carry a 250Watts Power Supply anymore all of them are either 300 or 350Watts and if you bought or built a Gaming Rig I'm sure you went insane with the Power and got the biggest thing you could afford.PCIE Connector and mine didn't require any additional power other than the one provided by the Motherboard which made swapping out cards extremely easy. I installed the Drivers provided by EVGA and then I launched my NVIDIA GEForce Experience and Updated the Driver to the latest (my previous card was also an NVIDIA card).  It took me longer to unplug all the cables and break my computer open and put it all back than it did to install the card and the drivers.Noticeable improvement in Video on Games and Performance.  I tested it against a recently purchased Game which is still in Beta (Star Citizen) which was very Jerky and requires a minimum of 2GB or RAM (I had just below 2GB at 1.7GB with my old one).  Not only did it render it beautifully the performance improvement was evidently.  I also test it with Mass Effect 2 (which my old card could handle easily) and the improvement in video detail was amazing (my wife who is not a gamer could tell the improvement immediately even though she's only seen the screen periodically here and there).  I tested it against SWTOR and I increased all the Graphics settings to high (which was nice to see the effect) and it handled beautifully.I have not done any Arena style gaming yet so I cannot speak on its performance on PVP and Arena Style games.  However, it handles fine in fights, zero lag or any issues that I have found.I am very happy with this purchase so far.  I was fretting between the EVGA, MSI or GIGABYTE one and looked at all the overclocking specs until I went cross eyed.  In the end I chose one that fit my budget below $160 and to be honest for the level of gaming I am doing (no VR obviously) it doesn't matter all the overclocking.  The bottom line is 4GB of dedicated DDR5 RAM just for Video.If you are fretting look at three things1. Get a card with minimum 128bit Memory Bus2. Get at least 4GB3. Price"", ""The DX12 OSD support and PXOC (Precision XOC) technology are fantastic additions that allow me to fine-tune the card's performance to suit my preferences. The EVGA Precision XOC software is user-friendly and provides extensive control over clock speeds, fan curves, and voltage, enabling me to optimize the GPU for maximum efficiency and overclocking potential.One of the standout features of this card is its cooling system. EVGA has equipped it with dual fans that efficiently dissipate heat, keeping temperatures well within acceptable limits. Even during extended gaming sessions, the card remains remarkably cool and quiet, eliminating any concerns about overheating.Installation was a breeze, thanks to the user-friendly design and clear instructions provided by EVGA. The card fit seamlessly into my system, and the software installation was hassle-free. Additionally, the build quality is excellent, and the card feels sturdy and durable.I also appreciate the HDMI, DisplayPort, and DVI-D ports, which provide versatile connectivity options for multiple monitors or various display devices. The card supports multiple displays, allowing me to enhance my productivity or indulge in immersive gaming experiences across multiple screens."", 'What I like about the 1050Ti is that it strikes an excellent balance of things.  It runs very cool and quiet while still performing excellently.  You probably don\'t want to use this for anything like VR, but for normal ~1080p gaming or whatever it\'s great.  It\'s extremely low power and very efficient, so your power bill won\'t go up just from playing games.But there\'s not much point in reviewing a specific GPU since that\'s not a specific product but a range with variance.  As for the actual product itself overall I\'m fairly satisfied.  I don\'t like flashy LEDs and such inside my computer so I wish it didn\'t do stuff like that, but it\'s overall not bright and not too bad (I still clipped the LEDs though.)  One thing that annoys me about this entire range of eVGA products (eg 1060, 1080, etc etc) is a very odd choice they seem to have on the cooling:  they turn the heatsink fins up and down instead of left and right.  What this ultimately means is that the rear output is fake and pointless.  All the heat from the videocard exhausts above and below it.  That means some pools towards the bottom of the case to be recycled (unless you have one of those turbine fans mounted below taking up a slot) and some goes towards the CPU.  Now, this is a pretty efficient line, so it doesn\'t put out a lot of heat (especially the 1050 -- even the Ti version) but how hard really would it have been to simply have the fins go left and right so at least some would exhaust out and the rest would be caught up in the normal fuller airflow?  It\'s just a silly and pointless design mistake that shouldn\'t have been made even on these cooler cards since it wouldn\'t have cost anything extra simply to have the fins turn the other way.  Since the fins turn the way they do it effectively blocks any air from actually going out that way.The other thing that annoyed me was the connector choices.  One DVI, one HDMI, and one DisplayPort (why?)  I would rather two HDMI or two DVI than a DisplayPort connector, but I think the most optimal solution would have been to include an adapter.  Unfortunately I end up with the wrong monitor as ""primary.""  It\'s fine within the OS itself, but the BIOS, bootup menus, initial setups, etc etc all end up on the wrong monitor.  Given that the second half of the card is not _ACTUALLY_ a rear exhaust, they may as well have used that area to spread out the connectors more and maybe provide an extra along the way.Now, all that said, it\'s overall a good card.  The fan is very good and quiet with plenty of CFM and the heatsink makes quite good contact.  The general build quality feels pretty good and I think this card will last a good long time.  Even with the LEDs it doesn\'t actually look bad (I\'ve seen some very questionable design choices out there, so this can be a consideration even if one doesn\'t care much about looks.)', 'EVGA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti SSC GAMING ACX 3.0, 4GB GDDR5, DX12 OSD Support (PXOC) Graphics Card 04G-P4-6255-KR\nSHIPPING AND PRICE:The price is very reasonable for what you get out of the card in terms of performance (More about that later). It took around 2-3 weeks and $4-8 to get the card to me in Australia in the outer suburbs of Wollongong.INSTALLATION:The installation was almost idiot proof, i use an Alienware X51 case since i have had this PC for over two years and have had no money to build my own PC at the time i got the PC (I was 13). It is has no need for power pin connectors, it only draws power from the PCI slot which, in my situation with the extremely small case is great. The only thing i needed to do was remove the black graphics holder so the card doesn\'t hang (Don\'t worry about that if you have another case, this is only a problem for us poor Alienware users ).The next part was the part i have never had to do before since this is my first time upgrading my PC with something significant, the software installation. At first i tried playing games and the computer would just lag like hell in the games, after ten mins of confusion and thinking i realised i needed to insert the installation disk to put in the new software for the card, after around 10-30 mins of installing, it was ready to be gamed on. :)PERFORMANCE AND SOUND:It is literally dead silent, my computer use to sound like a jet and now its a toned down jet (still a jet due to CPU cooler). Also the performance, for me at least was day and night (Coming from a crappy Dell GeForce GTX745).Coming from barely running ""Next Car Game: Wreckfest"" with 20-30fps on low settings to all the way to 50-60fps on fully maxed out settings on 1080P (you could say it was a massive leap for me). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3rCE8Ivv4A&t=26sPlaying Unturned on Medium settings with 20-40 fps depending on many factors, now i can play it with settings maxed on 40-70 fps.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR2YLdTmvmUCounter Strike: Global Offensive use to run at around 40-70 fps on the ""Canals"" map and now runs perfectly at 120-150fps easily.OVERCLOCKING:(Your results may vary, every card has a different maximum OC )Now, i can already hear from my fellow #PCMASTERRACE ""Why OC a card that is already OC stock?"" well let me explain.Coming from a graphics card that i got forced to push to the max to even play many games on low settings mainly, it is sort of a habit i have developed. Now, i can\'t help to brag but after testing out the games on stock without an OC, the card ended up being better then a FTW card when i overclocked it. Do i recommend overclocking this card? Yes, but when you are doing so, please do not tell the MSI or EVGA overclocker to use that OC on startup until you know that OC is stable enough. Also remember not all cards are made equally, someone out there could of pushed the card an extra 400Mhz but you can only do 140Mhz.COOLING:There is no debate about cooling, even in my case, with an OC, the card stays very cool no matter the situation.CONCLUSION:It is currently the best budget gaming card for this price point. The graphical power is the same or even a little more then what you paid for, it doesn\'t suck much power at all, doesn\'t require an power PIN connector and is dead silent. In my eyes i dont see any cons.Well.....Maybe one...Where is the RGB lighting??', ""So, I upgraded from a GT 620 to this GTX 1050 ti, making it my first game-grade card.  This was also the first GPU I've ever installed, but I was able to do it without using a manual.  In terms of difficulty, it's between RAM and HDD in difficulty but closer to RAM.  The hardest part was researching the available cards.My top reason for choosing this card is that it is the top-performing card that I was prettily sure would run on my current power supply and fit in my system.  I'm using the same 300 W power supply that came with my rig and I have a core i5 (quad), two HDDs, a USB hub, and one monitor attached.  I haven't noticed any increase in temperature or noise, and I haven't experienced any unexpected shutdowns.  Since installing the card, however, I did notice that DWM (Desktop Window Manager) would occasionally become unresponsive in Windows 7, forcing me to forcefully restart the system, though I can't say with certainty that the card was the culprit or that it only happened after installing the card.  Either way, since updating the GPU driver, the problem has never resurfaced.My old GT 620 was somewhere between an Wii U and Xbox One in terms of power, while the 1050 is beyond the PS4 Pro.  It's worth noting that NVidia states that this GPU does not support VR, though this was not a deal breaker for me.  I found it interesting that some predecessors in the 900 series had VR support, but those cards also seemed to require external connectors, which was a deal breaker for me, since I planned to play console-style titles in the future.  So, it looks like they had to sacrifice VR support for power consumption.One of the best features of recent NVidia GPUs is Share (i.e. ShadowPlay), a feature which allows gamers to record and broadcast their gaming sessions.  In the past I've tried using CamStudio to record gameplay, but it had some issues with flickering and recordings inexplicably stopping.  Share addresses these problems and there is no noticeable hit to performance.  Well, under Windows 7 there is a 4 GB file-size limit for video files, since Share uses Windows Media Foundation, but the nice thing about the recorder is that it will just create a new video file to continue recording.  This does ultimately require long sessions to be stitched if you’re planning to share your footage, but that can be done easily with any video editor.  With desktop capture enabled, which is what I use, you can capture anything on screen, even non-games.  The GUI for Share could be a somewhat more intuitive, but it mostly stays out of my way.  I simply use Alt+F9 to start and stop recording.  One important caveat of Share is that visual styles needs to be enabled for recording to work.  Consequently, the emulator Gens cannot be recorded full screen because it disables visual styles when in full screen; it will, however, work if the emulator window is stretched to fill the screen.I am satisfied with my purchase.  It's great being able to game at max settings."", ""First of all This is not a negative review on EVGA or Amazon! I am very happy with all the EVGA products and Amazon! But, I was a little disappointed in this new GTX-1050 Ti! Over the EVGA GTX-960 I was using! Nothing is wrong with ether card! There is just NO difference! in going to the new GTX-1050 Ti, There is NO difference in Color, Fram Rates, Speed, Nothing? At least noticeable! Or making it worth spending the money for the upgrade?

I feel the real problem is Geforce! Always telling you the you should or need to upgrade! Always updating sometimes 2 times a month? And yet leaving some older cards like in Laptops that you can not upgrade! With NO support at all! And these cards work just fine with todays games and I am sure not going to buy a NEW Laptop every 6 months to keep up with the requests of Geforce! I am very disappointed in that Medea organization! They seem to just be pushing people to buy new and better video cards when the ones they are using work just fine! At this point I will continue to use the GTX-1050 Ti for now, But I am going to try getting an AMD new card and seeing how that goes! I believe Geforce has gotten to big for there britches and are shoving new Medea down consumers thoughts whether they want it or not! Look at there adds when they do an upgrade! If you want to keep up with your games you need to buy this newer card! NO you do NOT! Do some research before buying a new card and see what you find out! If your getting 100 to 150 Frame rates and everything is set to maximum? And your are seeing great detail and great colors even clear underwater? You do not Need an new Video Card! If you do you will Not see any difference in your gaming performance for sure!? Again this is not any marks against EVGA or Amazon! I would give the card a +5 if it was something that I really needed to spend my money on! And it was not! And So, I am disappointed in this perches! I am sure some techie will have a bunch of technical writing to say I am doing something wrong and that's just fine! I have been a lead Tech for a major Bank in my city for 20 some years now retired! But I still build computers for customers and repair them, I know a little about a PC! (o;  The card is a +5 no doubt, This is my disappointment in Geforce!  Thanks for reading, Rick D."", ""Pros: Works well, decent graphics, no noise problems.Cons: Forced to create Nvidia account through Nvidia Geforce Experience software in order to update driver. Using Geforce software to tweak games always puts graphics too high. After several updates the Geforce software fails its updates and thus won't allow driver updates.I bought it for my Windows 7 64-bit desktop tower with quad-core CPU and 12 GB of RAM, to play Overwatch at medium to high graphics and it does its job pretty well. If I run on high graphics (sometimes on medium too) I do occasionally get a Windows prompt when I exit the game about the computer performing slowly and asking if I want to switch to the basic desktop window settings. I get a consistent 60-70 Frames-Per-Second (FPS) and despite the windows warnings I haven't seen any problems with performance. I get the warnings more often if I am also running a background app such as Discord (just an example, it's the only app I might actually want to run along with the game) in the background and so I tend to either exit that app when play or run the game on medium graphics when I need Discord. Although I still don't have any major problems when I do run them both at the same time. The main issue I have is with Nvidia drivers and Nvidia Geforce Experience software. They worked fine for a few months. I installed all the updates, driver and Geforce, but then all of the sudden the Geforce software just wouldn't update. I claims it has one, but when I got to update it just says the update failed. I uninstalled and reinstalled Geforce but it still won't update the software yet still keeps saying there's an update out there, and of course now there is a driver update which can only be installed through the Geforce app. Leaving me with no where to turn. I had this problem with my old Nvidia graphics card (except the driver updates would actually crash the computer and leave me booting into a black screen forcing me to revert to a restore point). Apparently this is a common problem with many Nvidia drivers of all different graphics cards and Nvidia seems to never do a damn thing about it. It's infuriating, but my graphics card still works so I've honestly just given up on updating it for now."", 'Works very well for a 4GB GPU']"

Things can get a little hot during gameplay, but as you can see in the picture, the card does have two fans which will greatly help, and you could always install a custom loop cooling system to further mitigate any heat problems. I was able to get this a tiny bit cheaper on Cyber Monday, but even at the current price it's a steal.Don't buy into the hype of the 1080 - right now it simply isn't worth the price point unless you absolutely have a ton of cash to throw left and right. It will be next year's budget card anyways when Nvidia reveals whatever is next, and the 1060 can last you a good few years if you take care of your rig.

Video is a touch smoother and games play much better. In addition the color and detail the monitor  is now able to display are better too (just a little bit clearer and more vibrant). I feel that I'm now able to see the capabilities of my dual IPS monitors brought out.So in conclusion:The old video was the stock Intel 460. This is a HUGE increase in video speed. However, many things remain the same and just increasing the video speed isn't the total cure but the real bonus for me is the application of filters and renders in Adobe Photoshop.

If you're really on a budget, you can go with the 1050ti but I'd say this is only a good choice for if you're strapped for money because the performance is definitely noticeable. On the other hand this card won't necessarily let you max out on all the latest games even on 1080p. If you're looking to do that, you'd have to go up to the 1070 which is pretty much double the price of this card. If you're planning on doing 1440p, I'd at least suggest the 6gb model. Really comes down to the resolution of your monitor and what kind of games you play.I upgraded from a AMD 7850 which is a 2012 card. I was a bit surprised when I saw no noticeable difference in games like CS: GO and Dota 2 which are pretty much the only games I play. Other games like Skyrim Special Edition I was able to max out to Ultra when I could only do medium/low before. Handles Bioshock Infinite easily. The only game it's run into any issues is was Mass Effect: Andromeda. I had to turn the settings to Medium to have it run at a comfortable frame rate without screen tearing. Maybe just and example of a poorly optimized game or other parts of my system's bottlenecks but kinda annoying when you buy a new graphics card and it can't plow through a recent title that doesn't even look that nice.

I play GTA V, Skyrim and Warframe most of the time and it has no problem running any of them.

Sin embargo, hacerse de una computadora nueva, no es barato.Lo que más le urgía a mi compu actual era la tarjeta de video, así que me decidí por esta 1060 de 6 GB DDR5 (que será la tarjeta de video de mi siguiente compu), para reemplazar la Radeon HD 7770 con 1 GB DDR5.Si bien mi procesador actual (Phenom II x6 1055)  no le ayuda mucho a la tarjeta de video, ésta sí le ayuda a él, y presenta una maravillosa oportunidad para ver los méritos de la 1060 por sí misma.  A saber: con la HD 7770 (y 8 MB de RAM )podía correr Middle Earth: Shadow of War... con todo en lo más bajo, pero lo podía correr.  Las gráficas eran terribles, pixeladas, pero inisito: corría.  Cambiando únicamente la tarjeta de video, esta 1060 6 GB, ahora puedo correr el mismo juego con casi todo en Ultra o High (una combinación de ambos).  La diferencia en gráficos es abismal, y es mérito de la tarjeta de video.Elegí este modelo en paricular porque lo encontré a buen precio, y fue para lo que me alcanzó.  Mis otras opciones eran las 1050 de 2 ó 4 GB, o la 1060 de 3 GB, pero ya entrados en gastos, de una vez la de 6 GB, para que dure unos años más.  Y es que ya las 1070 se dispara mucho el precio (ya no digamos las 1080).  Planeo ponerle más adelante un Ryzen  5 2600X o un Ryzen 7 2700X (según el presupuesto).Ahora, lo que más me sorprendió, y que era súper importante para mí: los ventiladores.  Hace muy poquito ruido (comparado con la 7770), lo cual no tiene precio.  Se puede configurar manualmente el ventilador, por supuesto, pero viene programada para NO utilizar los ventiladores sino hasta alcanzar los 60°C.  Es decir, cuando no está corriendo un juego, ¡no hace nada de ruido!  La configuración por omisión (y usando MSI Afterburn) deja utilizar la tarjeta hasta el 100% de su capacidad y no sobrepasar de 83°C.  Se le puede hacer overclocking si se quiere, aunque yo no pienso hacerlo sino hasta tener la nueva compu completa (ahorita no tiene caso, el CPU me limita de todos modos).Es importante mencionar que elegí la 1060 porque no pienso usarla más que en Full HS (1080), porque mi monitor no da más de 60Hz.  Una tarjeta de gama más alta sería literalmente un desperdicio.  No es comprar por comprar, ni necesariamente lo más caro es ""lo mejor"".  Depende mucho del uso que le vamos a dar, y yo soy feliz con 1080.  No me interesa jugar en 1440 ni en 4K.  No digo que esté mal, digo que no me interesa (y tampoco me alcanza).Recomiendo ampliamente este producto.

No, I'm not playing Crysis on High, but it pushed the games, man, and I didn't have any appreciable lag. Frame rates seemed decent, I just had no complaints.But I finally pulled the trigger, and settled on this card for a balance between budget and performance. Would I have liked the 6GB card? Darn right. But I was trying to be fiscally responsible. And this is actually my first nVIDIA GPU, I've always run with AMD. My first benchmark was Skyrim. Yeah, it's dated, but I hadn't played it when it first came out. I just don't see the point in paying $60 for a game I can get for half that in a year or two.Anyway, I enjoyed it immensely, I see why it was such a big deal when it first released, etc etc. And then they released the updated texture packs. Oh cool! So I moved on over to that version, and it was neat to see what they'd changed, what stuff looked more detailed or intricate.I still couldn't imagine what a difference a new card would make. I mean, I'm already pushing this game on Ultra settings, no problem. What difference could it possibly make?? So I threw the card in, loaded drivers, and started up Skyrim.Holy. $#!7. I mean, seriously. Still set to Ultra settings, but oh my god. It was like being handed glasses after never realizing you were nearsighted. Like suddenly being granted hearing when you didn't know you were deaf in one ear. The game just looks freaking remarkable in comparison, and I am amazed. I can't even quantify it enough to put into this review. There was more texture and (as much as is possible in that game from that year) more realism to objects. The parallax in high-ceilinged halls was absolutely stunning compared to what I was used to.

The 1050 is a great card but the performance difference is huge while the price difference was moderate.  The 1070 is an excellent card but it would end up costing more than my entire computer.  Most of the Nvdia 1060 GPUs are roughly the same regardless of the maker.  The main difference is the fans/cooling, the appearance, and the ports.  This gigabyte offers dual fans that supposedly offer more cooling due to the fan design.  I am not sure if its true but the temps have been fairly consistent and the fan is very quiet.  Keep in mind that with minimal to moderate use the fans do not come on at all (unlike GPUs of the past) once you reach a certain degree of use the fans will ramp up as needed.  Also worth noting is that this generation of Nvida cards have ""auto overclocking"" which means they can adjust their frequency depending on how you are using it.  This has worked out very well so far with the card humming with light apps at less than 400mhz and then going to full clock with heavy games.  The temperatures are reasonable (about 66 degrees at full load) and the performance has been spotless with my Core i5 setup.The only real downside to this is that it comes with no accessories.  Back in the day I recall GPUs coming with connectors adapters to allow you to use different types of monitors.  This GPU has 1 HDMI, 1 DVI, and 3 display Ports.  I would have much rather had more HDMI or DVI output or this could have come with adapters to allow you to switch but unfortunately I had to purchase the adapters myself.As long as you are ok with the ports then you won\'t be disappointed with the card.', ""I bought this graphics card to replace my gtx 750 ti. The primary reason being the amount of vram (gddr5). This 1060 has 6gb of vram, which, as graphical needs increase over time, should last for a good few years. I use this card for about 8 or 9 hours a day, and i use it for gaming  and game development in unity. The card works as expected and has no issues running games such as fortnite at 120 fps high settings. you can run ultra as well but you're going to want to cap the frames to 60 fps as to reduce frame drops. Unity runs very well, and is far better at building scenes and generating lighting(which was the biggest problem i had with my 750 ti).pros -6 gigabytes of vram.2 DVI ports to support dual monitors(i tested to ensure this works on windows 10, it does)Dual fans for better cooling. if you buy a 1060 i really recommend buying one with dual fans. it'll last much longer if cooled more adequately. i was worried mine would have cooling problems as i have a small case in a room thats usually about 74 to 75 degrees fahrenheit. but interestingly it only reached 107 fahrenheit under load. which for a gpu is not bad.cons - none really ;)pretty standard situation here. its a great card of course but it wont function as well as cards higher in the price range, which is to be expected.but for 300 USD this will do everything. i have not tested this against its amd counter part the rx 580/480 or with VR.

It gives you the ability to monitor the card memory, temp, speed as well as the GPU and even your CPU Temps.Compared to the GTX 950 2GB card it replaced it runs every game I have at max settings, with ease (the 950 could not run some of my games at max settings without some tearing and lagging). I love it so far and would recommend it to any gamer up to an intermediate level (maybe beyond - depending on the games).  It does take two card slots and uses the 6 pin external power connecter on the end of the card. It fit well in my ATX case, does not crowd the HDs or SDDs installed. I run games such as the Division2 and Tom Clancy's Wildlands and this card runs them all with no lagging or tearing at max settings. It says it is VR ready but I do not have any VR games for the PC yet.My system runs windows 10, on an Intel I-7 6700, 4.5GZ with 16GB of ram.What else can I say, great card and great service from Amazon.""]"

Le bond qualitatif niveau hardware par rapport à la 970 Mini est vraiment sensible. Le ventirad est un peu plus volumineux (en hauteur, pas en longueur, intelligent pour des config qui ne peuvent accueillir que des cartes très courtes, ainsi qu'en épaisseur), et globalement ça respire la belle qualité.D'une part, pour les intéressés, la 1070 mini est effectivement semi passive, le ventilateur se coupe sous les 50°. En gros en dehors de gros jeux, la carte permet d'avoir une config totalement silencieuse.D'autre part quand le ventilo se met en route... Pffff, l'évolution par rapport au ventirad de la 970 Mini qui était une sombre bouse ultra bruyante est vraiment incroyable. Et surtout, celui de la 970 tournait en permanence, et produisait une espèce de ronronnement permanent même au ralenti. Obligé de passer par un tweaker de BIOS pour l'obliger à s'arrêter au repos. La 1070 semble se tenir entre 40 et 45° au repos, et entre 65 et 70° en charge dans mon Lian Li PCQ33, ce qui est conforme à ce que j'en attendais, et identique voire une poignée de degrés en dessous de la 970.Et la 1070 Mini ne produit aucun coil whine, même si ce n'était déjà pas un problème avec la 970.Au niveau perf, je ne suis pas à la chasse aux Ghz ni un pro de l'overclocking. Cette carte fera donc certainement sa carrière aux fréquences stock. La seule chose qui m'importe, c'est que la 970 était trop juste pour jouer tranquillement en 1440p tout à fond, il était préférable de rester en 1080p. Avec la 1070, aucun problème.Bref, une jolie petite (littéralement) réussite de la part de Gigabyte. Evidemment ce n'est pas la moins chère des 1070, et si on se fie à la carrière de la 970 Mini, peu de chances de voir son prix vraiment baisser dans les mois à venir. On est sur un produit de niche. Mais pour qui veut une config musclée dans un tout petit boîtier, c'est vraiment la solution ultime."", 'Ich habe mir diese Grafikkarte als Ersatz für meine, in die Jahre gekommene, GeForce GTX 560Ti gekauft.Der Leistungsunterschied ist mehr als deutlich, was bei dem Preis aber auch zu erwarten ist. Es handelt sich schliesslich um eine Karte aus dem oberen Leistungssegment der NVidia Palette, nur die GTX 1080 (Ti) und die Titan X (Pascal) stehen noch darüber.Ich spiele hauptsächlich Battlefield 1 und dort habe ich mit Grafikdetails auf hoch an den meisten Stellen über 95fps. Klar hängt das auch noch von CPU, Ram und Co ab. Aber trotzdem ist die Karte ihr Geld auf jeden Fall wert.Zudem ist sie sehr kompakt von den Abmessungen her, so dass sie eigentlich in jedes Gehäuse passt.ABER VORSICHT: Die Mini-Version ist spürbar breiter als normale Grafikkarten. Dadurch hatte ich in meinem Shuttlegehäuse Probleme die Karte sauber zu installieren, da die Stromanschlüsse im verbauten Zustand ob an der Karte sind. Dadurch konnte ich den Stromstecker nicht verbauen. In ""normalen"" Gehäuse sollte aber auch das keine Probleme geben.Im Desktopbetrieb ist die Karte unhörbar, da der Lüfter bis ca 41°C GPU Temperatur still steht. Danach wird die Karte mit zunehmender Drehzahl deutlich hörbar. Das ist der Nachteil an der Mini-Karte, da dort nur ein Lüfter vorhanden ist.Mich persönlich stört es beim Spielen nicht, da ich eh nur mit Headset spiele.Alles in allem eine sehr gute Karte, die ich sofort wieder kaufen würde', ""Cercavo una scheda video il più potente possibile da inserire in un case mini-tower e l'ho trovata. Unico problema è che leggermente più alta di quello che mi sarebbe servito per chiudere il pannello del case, di un paio di centimetri per l'esattezza, ma questo già lo sapevo, nel mio caso tanto avrei lasciato comunque aperto visto che preferisco un maggiore ricambio d'aria per i componenti. Quindi prendete bene le misure prima dell'acquisto. Per il resto è una 1070 già overcloccata di fabbrica, ha prestazioni da vendere. Mi sono anche stupito della sua silenziosità e freschezza. Il dissipatore fa un lavoro davvero eccellente.

I did use the following products also to overclock with this:Thermal Grizzly Liquid Metal ( Warning this probably does void your warranty - I used this to replace the stock GPU Paste )\nThermal Grizzly Conductonaut Thermal Grease Paste - 1.0 Gram\nTitan Adjustable PCIE FAN ( Placed under the EVGA GTX 1060 for increased airflow )\nTitan Adjustable Dual Fan PCI Slot VGA Cooler (TTC-SC07TZ)\nSally Hansen Clear Nail Polish ( For covering the capacitors and power connectors around the GPU because Nail Polish is Non-Conductive )\nSally Hansen Color Therapy Nail Polish, Top Coat 0.5 Ounce Long-Lasting Nail Polish with Gel Shine and Nourishing Care\nDISCLAIMER: I don't recommend you try the modifications I have in my review unless you know what you are doing, do so at your own risk as this most likely will void your warranty. But if $350 doesn't matter to you and you are an expert, then read on.I first unscrewed the cooler from the Graphics Card on the back plate with 4 phillips screws and disconnected the side fan connector, this exposed the copper heat sink and the GPU. I used Alcohol Wipes to gently remove all of the stock GPU Paste and waited a few minutes to dry, then I used the Sally Hansen Color Theraphy Nail Polish, which by the way is NON CONDUCTIVE and is safe to use, by applying it around the GPU Die on the capacitors and power connectors creating a protective cover. I waited 10 minutes for it to dry and then applied 3 more layers, this was done to prevent a power short circuit in case liquid metal got on the capacitors around the GPU Die. Just to be clear the Nail Polish was placed around the GPU and note directly on it. Once the Capacitors were completely covered in Nail Polish, I placed a pea sides amount of liquid metal on the GPU Die and used the QTIP to spread it nice and evenly on the GPU Die like butter.Turning on my computer the Idle Temperature went from 42 Degrees Stock Paste to 36 Degrees Ambient Temperature with the Liquid Metal.Starting off with testing, I did download the latest drivers from EVGA Website and as of this review it is display driver 398.11 with BIOS 86.06.68.00.62 as of 06/06/2018.Stock the card does come with a stock clock speed of 1607 MHz / Real Boost Clock: 1835 MHz. However, I was able to get that up to 2164 Mhz on the GPU Clock and 4498 Mhz on the Memory clock.Using the following settings with my modifications, I downloaded EVGA Precision OC from EVGA's website and also EVGA Scanner XFor EVGA Precision OC I used the following settings:Turn on KBOOST ( Forces GPU to operate at full boost  clock 100% of the time)120% Power Target (This is your TDP - Thermal Design Power) - Gives your Graphics Card 20% more power for higher overclocksBreak the link for both Power Target and Temperature ( You want this so that you get more power regardless of temperature)Set Priority to Power TargetFor Voltage I set it to 70%For Fan Speed, I set it to 70% ( It's loud but I can use a Gaming Headset )GPU Clock Speed Offset set to +160 MhzMemory Clock Offset set to +496 MhzAlso Motherboard Southbridge Voltage was increased to 1.25 Volts, VDDR Voltage increased to 1.25 Volts, VDDR PCIE Voltage increased to 1.25 Volts. This was done to increase power delivery to the Graphics Card from the PCIE Slot on the motherboard due to the high 120% TDP.Running a stress test for at 4K Resolution at 3840 x 2160 Pixels with 8X MSAA produced a steady frame rate of 43 Frames Per Second at 65 Degrees Celcius, up from 10 Frames Per Second at stock and this test ran for 10 minutes rendering over 25,000 Frames without crashing.This pretty much turned my GTX 1060 into a GTX 1070 for a much lower price as the 1070's sell for about $500 and made gaming at 4K on the 1060 to be actually playable.Gamers probably won't need to run 8X MSAA and can do just fine with 2X MSAA when Gaming at 4K with my modifications  since you can't really notice jagged edges at 2X Anti Aliasing and 4K and overclocked the frames never ran below 30 Frames per second.Final Conclusion:The EVGA GTX 1060 6GB overclocks like a champ and with liquid metal, great cooling fans from your case and a PCIE Fan Cooler, you can easily turn your overclocked 1060 into a stock 1070 when running at 4K Resolution that is 24/7 Stable. Your results may vary with the Silicon Lottery, but I highly recommend this product if you are buying it with overclocking in mind, it does great. Pushing it past 2,200 Mhz however did not happen for me and most I was able to do was 2164 Mhz, it is probably possible to go to 2,200 Mhz by doing shunting mods, but that is probably a 2-4% increase in performance from 2164 Mhz and honestly not worth it IMO."", ""As modern games are starting to require 6-8GB of RAM, the 1060 is a fading star. But if you're playing older titles and 1080p content, it's an ace."", 'First I\'ll disclaim I wanted to initially give this two stars for the noise, then three after I fixed it in my own way, but I\'m finally opting for a four star review, mainly because EVGA provides very good service and warranty, and was very responsive to queries online. So consider the card 3.5 stars and an additional half star for the quality of service behind the product.==============================I bought this card because Amazon wouldn\'t allow more than one per household on the MSI GTX 1060 AERO ITX model. This card is technically more powerful than that model, being ""superclocked"" and all. And I have to admit, it\'s a great card. However the enclosure and fan leaves something to be desired.The fan on this card is much too aggressive. Apparently it initially had a max fan speed of 2600RPM but a BIOS update on later revisions bumped it to 3900RPM after some issues with the EVGA 1070 and 1080 models. This card isn\'t impacted but I guess it was a precautionary measure. But because of this, the card sounds like a jet engine once you get into the mid-50% speeds on the fan, and the stock fan curve is extremely aggressive, ramping up as high as 70%+ speed when the card is around 70c (when it can easily go up to 80c without any throttling or problems). This was a souce of confusion, since video reviews on the card note it\'s whisper quiet, but that was way back before the vBIOS was changed.MSI Afterburner or similar software is a must for this card, not for overclocking, but for fan control. A custom fan curve goes a long way, and you can keep this card at around 75c or below at 100% load with a fan speed of about 52%, at least in my case (Corsair Carbide 100R Silent edition with two front intake 120mm fans and one rear exhause 120mm fan). I highly recommend installing MSI Afterburner or EVGA\'s own Precision X OC immediately after installing this card and setting your own fan curve. Doing so will turn this card from ""powerful but I don\'t want to use it"" to just ""powerful.""So basically, I tentatively recommend this card. It\'s good, and a fantastic 1080p gaming card, and pretty decent even at 1440p. But without an aftermarket cooler or a custom fan curve it\'s really noisy.=========================Lastly, a note for Linux users:Obviously you don\'t have access to tools like MSI Afterburner. That\'s cool though, you\'ve got bash. I got some help online and came up with a script that controls this card\'s GPU (well, any Nvidia card) based on the temperature. You can find it at the link below:https://pastebin.com/2iANCPEyThe script controls the fan by using an offset value to set the fan speed to an offset of the temperature. If the card is below 56c the fan will stay on at 12% speed which is essentially spinning but inaudible. Once it passes that temperature threshold, it sets the fans speed to the temperature plus the offset. In my case an offset of -22 worked well. That way at 60c the fan will be at 38%, at 70c the fan will be at 48%, and so on. Seems to be perfectly adequate for cooling during gaming, and I\'m seeing max temps of around 73-74c under load at 51-52% fan speed with the script. You can modify the offset value however works for you.To run the script, just make a copy locally and save it, chmod the file with a value of 755 (or just chown it, whatever), and call it with ""bash ./filename.sh"" If you do ""bash ./filename.sh -v"" it will do verbose output to the console and display the fan speed and gpu temp at each interval (8 seconds by default). If you\'re doing this from a remote terminal, you can use ctrl+z and then bg to set it as a background job, or just call it with the & symbol at the end when starting it so it doesn\'t take over the terminal session.Be aware, you need to be using the proprietary Nvidia driver for this to work, and you\'ll need to enable cool bit for fan control via ""sudo nvidia-xconfig --cool-bits=4"" (or --cool-bits=12 if you\'d also like to enable overclocking). Then reboot for the cool-bit value change to take effect. A value of 4 enables manual fan control, 8 for OC in nvidia-settings. 12 enables both. You can also enable voltage control in addition to the rest with a value of 28.This only works on more recent revisions of the Nvidia driver (I believe versions above 340). I\'m on Ubuntu 18.04, and this should work on at minimum 16.04 and up, plus other distros with similar versions and kernels. If you have a really old distro or much older drivers for some reason, you can use the script I originally based mine on, which can be found at the link below:https://gist.github.com/loathingKernel/995777d2aab6dc82316ea2da62142975', ""This review is in two parts. The first part is short about the card. the Second part is in relation to the delivery.Card Summary: Card is great, I highly recommend it.Delivery Summary: Delivery was terrible and this review is a way to voice the issue - it could have happened to anyone.The card.The GeForce GTX1060 6GB SC is more than adequate for my needs. The initial Game testing I have done on it, makes a world of difference moving up from onboard graphics - I am not overly technical so won't go into technical aspects. It is fairly simple to install, supply the power to it via a 6 pin PCIE connector, any software / drivers needed the PC took care of all of that. I would recommend to anyone prepared to spend the money on a high spec 1060 card, with a singe fan card requirement (i was limited by case dimensions). Check your card dimensions, check your PSU, install and enjoy.Amazons delivery.The process of getting the card, was poor and disappointing, between Amazon and the Courier.Amazon have always delivered to expectations in the past. I recently started paying for prime and whilst I wont make a correlation between the two, the first delivery on a paid prime service, went wrong twice.In total I received 2 GPU cards from Amazon.I placed the order on Wednesday 25th April 2018 (sold by Amazon, shipped by Amazon) and got the 1st card on Thursday 26th April 2018.The Graphics card is shipped by Amazon in the graphics card box, (as it comes from the manufacturer), mine was not taped or wrapped, already open, slightly crushed & slightly ripped - inside you could say it all looked ok (If I assume it is complete), but not knowing how it should look when buying a new graphics card and not wanting to put a potentially a used, dropped or faulty card into a PC, I phoned Customer services as soon as receiving it and requested a replacement.The replacement couldn't be shipped for the next day, even though in stock, the replacement card would be picked on Saturday 29th April and then delivered on Monday 30th April. I was given the choice to cancel my order and re-place the order - but I would not know if the second one would arrive in the same way, so the Amazon CS rep assured me that if I went for the replacement, it would be picked, packed in a box and shipped to me for Monday 30th. I could then return the existing open graphics card box in the replacement Graphics card delivery packing from Amazon.Frustrating but with no way to accelerate or escalate the issue, I had to accept that my 9 year old son would be disappointed.Monday came, expectations were set. The Amazon app gave a notification that the delivery driver showed up as being just a few more stops away, 30 minutes later the notification said the delivery had failed because no one was available to sign for the goods - not sure what the 60 people in the building and the staffed reception were doing - however given that there have been several occasions of failed deliveries to the address across many Amazon accounts, it can be assumed there is a common link (and it isn't the customers).Another call to Customer Services, to discuss the failed promised delivery - achieved nothing more than an investigation request internally.  Advised it would arrive Tuesday 1st May. It did. the Graphics card came in cellophane, so no box, no packaging beyond what the manufacturer intended. I wasn't so worried about this, it looked new.Attached are two images.1.) The original Graphics card as received, box half open. It appears to be used / 2nd hand.. why?  no cellophane, box open, different anti static stickers applied, power adapter cable unpacked.2.) The 2 graphics cards together, you can see that the replacement on the left, is packed differently, with different static stickers, the power cable adapter is in a sealed bag (as opposed to the first delivery which just had the cable loose in the box.)Why a 4 star review?If I give it 5 stars, it seems like everything went well. The card is definitely worthy of 5 stars. Had the first card (Sold by Amazon, Shipped by Amazon) arrived as new, it would be a 5 star review. 3 stars would reflect poorly on the card, I don't want to do that.The Logistics, used goods, not meeting customer expectations and inability to deliver when suggested, it was just bad,  and I feel that some other online businesses, whilst a few pounds more would have taken a bit more care and attention to what was happening.."", 'I ordered this card for two main reasons. One, I wanted a upgrade from my GTX-960 that would be in my budget range and two, if I upgraded my card I wanted a memory upgrade too. Since my old GTX-960 had 4 gigs of GDDR5 RAM then I wanted at least a 2 gig step up to 6 gigs. I also liked the short single fan cards as they fit in my case better without having to move stuff all around. (I like the case I have even though it\'s not the roomiest I\'ve seen.) When I read about the GTX-1060 SC which was like my GTX-960 as far as shape was concerned. And then I found out it came in a 6 gig GDDR5 RAM set up. And to top this off it\'s specs showed it gave a GTX-980 a run for the money and then there was the price at $259 and that\'s when I ordered it on 7/19/16 when they came out. (I\'ve noted a bit of an up ward direction of the price in the days after it came out.) It came in today and it looked to be just what I wanted. When I got it in, I noted it was about the same size as the 960 was. I noted it wasn\'t quite as heavy as the 960. but I noted that the heat sink looked very solid and had copper cooling pipes on it. It came with an adapter for using a old style molex type power plug to power the card.(I didn\'t need this as my PS had the correct cable and plugs to fit. The one thing I did note (and I was prepared for) was that the DVI output was the DVI-D type and no VGA output nor a DVI-I (which has a VGA output on the side.) So if your thinking of getting this card and you have standard VGA, you\'ll need an active DVI-D to VGA adapter or use the HIMI slots. I had gotten an adapter as that\'s what I read when I was considering this card. Installation when fairly smoothly. I first uninstalled the 960 by deleted the card from the device manager and then shutting down the system to do the hardware install. (Since this card uses the same drivers as the 960, I\'ve been a bit lucky in that I\'ve been able to delete the card in the device manager and then shut down and install the new card and boot back up and each time I\'ve used this approach, Windows has always loaded the driver and identified the new card. (BTW: This wouldn\'t work if I changed brands.) This time was no different. Windows booted up and a couple of seconds later I was notified to reboot so the drivers could be installed and when I did the card was up and running with the latest drivers. I had no problems after the reboot and the card seemed very solid so far. I decided to fool around with a couple of things just to see how it ran. First I loaded up ""Remember Me"" just for a little play time. It ran great. I didn\'t experience any problems running the game. I did note that the game seemed to render somewhat better than I remember and backgrounds looked better. I ran Kingdom of Amalur and it looked much better. (I didn\'t note quite as many background scenes sore of change around as you got closer to them or looked at them from a different view.) I also noted the colors seemed a bit more vivid to me, but this might just be me liking the game which I do. I experienced no lags to speak of and the game just ran great. I did note a few things I did like. The fan on it was very quite to me, and I liked that it was on all the time. I\'ve had a video card and a power supply burn up when the fan wasn\'t running even if it wasn\'t supposed to be and I like the fan running. (I noted the card ran cooler than my 960 at 35c when in idle.....nice.) I also noted that it was very fast when loading up images at least for me. It seemed well able to handle what I threw at it and I tend to be a rough at times. So far, I\'m very happy with my new card. I\'ll need to see how well it holds up to use and that will really tell the tale. So far a very nice card for the money.', ""I've never liked writing shorter tech reviews because certain products are costly. If you overlook something in your research, then you spend more time and money trying to correct it. Also for this review, I use GPU, card, and graphics card interchangeably.I've wanted to play the more recent console games that have also been coming out for PC, but my NVIDIA GeForce GT 730 GPU for desktop couldn't keep up...not even close. I spent quite a while researching and deliberating between this graphics card or the higher benchmarked 1070 or 1080 version (including the Ti versions) NVIDIA cards. I ultimately went with this 1060 6GB SC from EVGA as I could keep my current power supply unit, and didn't need to replace my 6 pin connector (which would have added to the cost up front and slightly higher electric demand). I'm not considering using ultra-high graphics or manually overclocking this GPU anyways. My logic was it would last me about as long as a console, but was happy to noticed it improved the quality of the display for images/movies over the original, lower-performing 730 GPU. So I might even be able to benefit from it longer still.Installation: I use Windows 10--not sure if this is important, but maybe helpful for you. I've never installed a graphics card in my life, so after reading/watching how it was done online, I found it superbly easy once inside the machine. Ridiculously easy even. I did have some trouble with the software installing from CD (the EVGA website has it anyways all nicely updated so it saves time from needing a second update), but the included benchmarking software (including one for VR) went on a-okay. Was way easier then expected.Impressions during play/viewing: Remember how I said my old, basic 730 GPU couldn't keep up with newer games? This1060 SC graphics card fixes a 1-5 second processing delay the old GPU gave me (and I was really sacrificing graphics quality on that old card). Now, I am running with higher quality graphic settings in-game and my gameplay is no longer lagging from intense graphics. No problems yet during gameplay with STEAM's and NVIDIA software's recommended settings, and the only periods in gameplay it seemed to have trouble with was graphically intense cutscenes. [Not sure if that is really this card's fault as the game is  a hybrid between local files and network connection.] The fan on this card is probably the noisiest one on my whole desktop (become aware when the fan kicks up, but it's nowhere near jump-scaring me), but I hear that noise level is common across all these NVIDIA 10-series GPUs. I'm glad EVGA designs their fans to be slightly quieter because of this. Other games that worked with my old GPU (think RPGs, World of Warships, etc) actually look sharper for better or worse (it highlights quality of detail the designers put into it the game, but also highlights some of the graphical imperfections--still not complaining though since stuff loads great at on good quality settings). Outside of gameplay, my background images that cycle for my PC are significantly enhanced both in textures and colors. To give you an idea, one of my backgrounds is a landscape that has a brushstroke effect that is now showing up significantly clearer--something I could notice on my old 730 GPU, but nothing with this detail.Other impressions: It's not a full-length desktop card, but the card has significant bulk and heft to it. Was actually surprised by the size and how sturdy it looked and felt since I mostly know friends that use gaming laptops. As far as detail goes, others are commenting on how much sharper things look from my PC now, and I haven't even changed my monitor! I'm sure this already is obvious, but if you are gaming expect heat generation. Keep that in mind in case its hot outside or now that winter is coming.Will update should anything change or find something else out that's cool about it."", ""I bought one of these (New) in November 2018 for $200.As of May 2023, it's still going strong and handles pretty much anything I can throw at it at 1080p 144fps. However, some relatively new and intensive games hover around 60-80fps. Very quiet in my Fractal Design R4 case.It's just barely powerful enough for VR with a Oculus Rift S. Occasionally less-optimized or more intensive applications stutter or experience frame drops but overall this card is functional for VR. I have not tried it with Half Life: Alyx yet but I'm not expecting amazing results.No plans to upgrade yet. Maybe in another 3-5 years?"", ""What made me decided to buy one:  I've been on an Nvidia GTX 760 SC that was manufactured by EVGA for around 2 and a half years and it was beginning to show it's age somewhat. There would be stutters and sometimes crazy framerates(Not unplayable however) on certain games (Overwatch and Witcher 3:Wild Hunt being big ones that come to mind) and sure I could downgrade some of my settings to achieve a more stable framerate but I wanted to really push cards to their limits and enjoy 1080P PC gaming at it's best. I assumed it was time to upgrade because I wanted to play on maximum settings on games and prepare my computer for upcoming titles such as Destiny 2 and Assassins Creed: Origins for example. Six months later after owning this card, I can definately say it's one of the smarter purchases I've made.How well does it run games and is it loud or does it get hot?:  For 1080P gaming this will suit your needs as of now(9/9/17) and most likely for the next few years. The specs on this card compare to the Nvidia GTX 980 but it's ever so slightly worse in some situations or better in others. It all boils down to how well optimized the game actually is. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt saw a performance increase of almost double at 1080P with ultra settings, going from about an average of 25FPS with the 760 SC to about 60 FPS in a lot of places except for densely populated places with the 1060 SSC!  The card also runs very quietly and very efficiently as well. The fans are actually one of the more impressive parts believe it or not. The way they're designed to last almost four times as long(We'll see about that!) and with proper ventilation of heat, could not turn at all(It's a good thing actually, that's how they're supposed to work) to keep power costs lower. When actually gaming or doing strenuous tasks the fans will turn obviously. Heat isn't an issue if even if you have the most basic form of ventilation(like I do and which is why I bought the double fan) The card fits into a mid tower case which is also nice.Why this card would be good for you:It may seem like I'm worshipping this graphics card, but I won't deny it has a specific role and if used for other things that isn't 1080P you're either paying too much or didn't get a beefy enough GPU. For example, if you plan to go onto 1440P or 4k gaming, don't bother with this and stead go to the GTX 1070 or GTX 1080. The GTX 1060 won't able to match the performance of those cards with that type of resolution, it's built for great 1080P gaming. Also if you're comming from the 900 series, more specifically the GTX 970 or 980 and especially the 980 TI, you wouldn't get much of a performace gain and in the case of the 980 TI, will be a downgrade in terms of performance. If you're comming from the 700 Series, before that even or switching from AMD to Nvidia and want some of the best cost performance 1080P graphics cards, this is rightfully for you!TL:DR: Upgraded from a 760 SC from EVGA to this, great performance, quiet, no bad heating, recommended for 1080P gaming or for those looking to upgrade from an older card that isn't from the 900 series as it offers similar performance to them."", ""This review is of the EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB GDDR5 Superclocked card, p/n 03g-p4-6162-kr I got this quite a few months back, and at the time graphics cards were still at a premium due to crypto currency mining.  I researched performance of the different models, and realized the 1060s were far better than the 1050s, and only slightly slower than the 1070s, with the 1080s being way out of my price range.  And despite some really adamant bloggers complaining about the diminished architecture of the 3GB version, in real world performance testing, the 3gb and 6gb cards were functioning nearly identical.  So when this particular card went on sale, I jumped on it.  I've had no problems with EVGA products in the past, and they tend to out preform the competition with their OC models.One nice thing is size.  It was easier to both install and remove, because there isn't more card blocking access to the PCIe x16 riser lock.  When everything else is hooked up, that can be difficult to get to.Another great thing is that it needs just a single fan.  That means it's quiet.  And unless the graphics are getting really intense, that fan doesn't even need to run much of the time.This card comes with a good combination of ports.  Ok, so to hook up all there of my dvi monitors, I had to buy two new cables, but it does support several monitors, which is great when working from home.Note: I honestly haven't looked into whether or not this card supports 3d output to multiple monitors, since most games do a terrible job of supporting it.I'm not an FPS fan, but I did want better performance and quality from the games I do play (Battletech, Fallout, a bunch of steam games, etc.).  This card was an upgrade to my old PC, replacing a GTX570, and it significantly improved my frame rates, with higher quality settings.I've since built a new PC based off the i5-9600k, and this is still a perfect video card for what I'm playing right now.  I'm playing all my games on the highest quality settings, and maxing the refresh rate of my aging 60Hz monitors.  I expect I'll upgrade in a year or two, and probably buy a new gaming monitor at that time, too.  For now, this still meet my needs, and I'm very happy with it.I haven't seen any graphical glitches, or had any crashes.  The Nvidia driver installs are flawless, as always.There is a utility from EVGA, Precision XOC, that looks great for those that really want to control their overclock settings, but I haven't had need to mess with it at all."", 'Review for: 1060 SC Gaming ACX 2.0 Single Fan 6GBIf you are as curious as I was to what the difference of single vs twin fan cards are, I found the simple answer browsing some PC build forums.Basically, a lot of it boils down to looks, and the rest is how far you can overclock past stock.-PC enthusiasts love beefy, expensive looking cards and equipment to fill out their towers, and twin cards deliver with their bigger case, lights, and backplate. Single fans don\'t have any of that, but are cheaper as a result.-Single fan cards also don\'t stand up to overclocking as much as twin fans because of heat dissipation. That\'s not to say single fans aren\'t adequate out of the box. If you don\'t plan on overclocking, a single fan is just fine and will never overheat. Running at full power on max settings playing OW makes the GPU top out at 72C. If you\'d like you can also alter the fan speed settings within the Bios to keep the GPU cooler or quieter.You really don\'t need a twin fan model, or really anything above a 1060 if you\'re a basic gamer that doesn\'t care about looks and  just wants a high performance card you don\'t plan on messing with. I\'m playing on a 144mhz monitor and get 160FPS playing Overwatch on Ultra, and about 100 on Epic. TF2 is beyond easy to play at max and Subnautica looks absolutely beautiful on topped out graphics with no stuttering. My tower is in a somewhat confined space as well and the card has never overheated even in 5+ hours of non-stop gaming.UPDATE: I downloaded the ""Precision X"" Bios from EVGA and updated the card. It\'s now faster then ever. Even on stock tune and no overclocking the card is now peaking at 2012mhz, WAY higher than advertised and higher than any stock clocked 1060 on the market. I\'m loving this card more every day.']"

Definitely a significant improvement over integrated graphics, allowing your PC to clock higher FPS on higher graphics settings. No more frame freeze!Do your research before you buy though, it may save you a lot of hassle; and, don\'t expect it to give you 50+ frames outdoors on high settings. It won\'t, and it shouldn\'t be expected to. It will give you about 15-20 FPS though. I can see what\'s happening and the image isn\'t jumping around, which is good enough for me.1. First, look up your PC\'s specs (if it is a premade stock--if custom built you may need to open it up to look). Make sure your PSU is at least 300 watts, which is recommended for this product.2. You\'ll also need a PCIe x16 expansion slot, which is where the new card will go.3. Look at the back of the display device you plan to use with this card and check to see if it has a port that matches the type of output options your card has, which is DVI-I most of time. This is fully compatible with a DVI-D monitor (not sure if there are any versions of this product with a DVI-D output but if so DVI-D will not be compatible with an analog or DVI-A port). If your monitor only has a VGA input, you\'ll need to purchase a DVI to VGA adapter. I would recommend getting a DVI-I or DVI-D adapter--DVI-A will work but the video will not be as high quality.4. Finally, find out if your PC uses Secure Boot--if so, you\'ll probably need to turn it off in BIOS. Search the web for instructions on how to enter your PC\'s bootloader and switch to Legacy Boot. On most Windows 8/8.1/10 systems, Shift+Click the restart button in the power menu to reboot your machine to the boot settings menu. Click ""Troubleshoot"", then UEFI, then restart. Different manufacturers will have slightly different BIOS UIs, but look for something that says ""Security"" with options to enable/disable Secure Boot and Legacy Boot. You\'ll want to disable Secure and enable Legacy, then make sure you save your settings before you exit.Once you have done that and booted to the normal desktop, your screen\'s resolution may have reverted to 1024 x 768 or some extremely low and awkward looking setting. Do not panic, this behavior is expected. Insert the disc provided in the package, or if you do not have an optical drive you may need to visit EVGA\'s website to see if you can find the driver and download it from there. If you used the disc, open up your file explorer and double click the disc drive to run it and bring up the autoplay menu. You\'ll need to install the graphics card driver and DirectX, the other applications are optional. Once the driver has been installed, your screen should return to its normal resolution.Finally, a nod to EVGA\'s customer support, which is as everyone else has been saying, amazing. 24/7 tech support, and not some person with a thick accent who is difficult to understand. The unit I purchased was a dual-DVI version, and one of the ports (the one I tried first of course), wasn\'t working. The agent didn\'t think to ask about that but I figured it out on my own. They offered to RMA, though I declined for the time being since I don\'t even own another display device with which to make use of the other port. But the card does come with a 3-year warranty, which is awesome, so if I ever decide I do want to use the other port, I could just have it replaced as long as it\'s within the next few years. On top of all that, they had the customer service manager follow up with me personally through email after I left comments in the feedback survey. I don\'t think I\'ve ever before known a company to actually do that. Really impressive service, in fact probably some of the best I\'ve ever seen. A+.', ""Oh, where to start. First of all, my PC is a HP Pavilion p6110f, which this GC upgraded for me.Introduction: The EVGA Graphics card is a good upgrade for those on a old Computer such as a 2009 based PC. It's easy to plug into a PC using PCI express, and works very well on any pc with that one thing. However, there are certain flaws a gamer and PC enthusiast should be aware of.Design Choices: The Design of my model of the Graphics Card has a large heatsink. This makes it difficult and impossible for me to install another GT 730. Its fine in my honest opinion, but the idea of having a fan for less space makes me want to replace this card with that.Hidden Costs: Oh yes, this has them. First of all, if you're upgrading a PC from the early 2000's, or anytime before PCI express, you have to upgrade the motherboard! Now, I had the luck to avoid that problem, for my motherboard has 1 PCI express x16 slot, but its a hidden cost for people who are using a old PC. Second hidden cost is Power. Most PC's have a 250 Power supply, which was sufficiant for my PC, but if you don't have 300watts, you're not pushing the Graphics card to it's limits. What I mean is, it does work with 250 watts, but for a gaming rig, it's not fully pushed to its potential. So, thats another hidden cost TO A GAMER.My Experience: The Graphics card was easy to install, drivers breezed through. However, 2 months after I recieved this, (Yes, don't ask why I review it now) My HDMI port dies on me, making it impossible to have a TV/PC monitor combo, a small loss, but it sucks a bit for video editing.Overall: The GT730 Graphics Card is a nice upgrade, but for gaming,  I suggest a more expensive card, such as the 970 for gaming builds."", ""Good product but don't buy mini hdmi adapter because it won't fit on card due to position of port on the card"", ""I haven't really noticed a lot of improvement over my old ATI X800 XT considered to be one of the top graphic cards back in 2004.  The EVGA, however, will allow me to upgrade to a more current Windows operating system.  When I used Windows 7 Advisor I was informed the old card would not be compatible.  Now the old Dell XPS Gen 3 Pentium IV is compatible.  It has met my needs in this respect.  Also the EVGA was reasonably priced so that I would not have to put too much money into an old Desktop.  I will say that this old Dell has been the best computer I've owned and I've owned computers since 1982 when I used Microsoft DOS 1.0 on a single floppy disk.  There is really a lot you can do with older computers to improve speed and overall performance.  I have 2 other household computers running Windows 10 and would eventually like to have all 3 on network together.  I believe the EVGA is a worthwhile purchase and I recognize their are graphics cards far superior in speed and function.  If my old computer would handle a more powerful card I might have purchased a more expensive card.  I may actually be underrating the EVGA as I just installed the card today.  Thank goodness it was compatible with my old 2004 Dell having one of the first PCI-e slots.  Notice I said only 1 as the rest of the slots are PCI without the PCI-e.  The benchmark ratings on the GeForce GT 730 2GB DDR3 128 bit are good in comparison with similarly priced graphic cards."", ""i have had this card ten months,and this card is excellent card even though it is a passive cooling 64 bit card it performs superb,and uses fits half in your pci-e slot bit . but i use it in a dell 780 dt model w/ 4gb memory,win 10,and 255 watts of power,and it fits fine.its heat sink is wide. so make sure you have two pci slots free. i use it mostly  for pc gaming and media streaming like netflix,hulu,and etc. it gives me a 9.9 win score on 3d and gaming. it played all of my games with win 10 smoothly,and faster more on high.or ultra settings settings,and no lags,or problems. it never went pass 85 C during heavy game play with lots of things going on,and it performed excellent. it also give you good hd with hd montior during media viewing,and movie watching. overall it is a great entry level gaming card for low power pc's like mine. so far it taking everything i throw at it. the card does not overheat,and is quiet . i tested it with msi kombustor 3d at 98-100 % load its temp reached 90 c and leveled out at a steady 90 c then cooled down quick as a fan cooled card. i overclocked it some,and it ran good then i set it back to its normal .you can over clock it runs a few degrees hotter,and good. but it works just fine at default speed. you are skeptical cause its only pci-e x8,and no fan then your wrong. the heatsink works as good as the fan,and it will not break or stop as a fan it. this passive cool card is good for gaming,and if you have a good processor and memory. it will rock your games,and great hd video,and media playing. once installed if working properly you will see a change in performance immediately. best affordable entry level gaming card,and is passive cooled."", ""I needed this for a server that only had room for a low profile card and it fit perfectly.  It draws under 25w on boot which is ideal for systems that are picky about limited power draw on startup i.e., older dell enterprise servers.  It includes a tiny bracket you can use if you don't need the VGA port.  The heatsink does what it should as the card doesn't get unreasonably hot - just make sure you have some direct airflow over the heatsink.You'll struggle to play many new games on this card, it's not fast, it's not pretty, and it has no fan.  However it's compact in size and is ideal for a workstation or basic server GPU.My only complaint applies to Amazon rather than the card itself.  Amazon just placed the card and its thin factory box into a brown envelope with only minimal insulation against shipping damage.  The box arrived somewhat crushed although somehow the card wasn't damaged.  This should have been shipped inside a cardboard Amazon box rather than a paper envelope."", ""I just installed the GT 730 in a HP 8200 Elite SFF, it was plug and play, detected immediately upon booting up with DVI cable hooked up to a monitor.  I didn't need to disable the onboard video card or make any changes in the bios, so I'll assume it runs this card beside / in addition to the onboard, however, note that with the huge, tall heat sink it covers the additional PCIE slot above it, rendering that expansion slot useless.  I haven't been able to test it yet on my 4k TV yet.  But looking through the description on Amazon, which was my key factor in purchasing this card, it states the MAX Resolution for the 02G-P3-1733-KR is: Max Digital: 4096x2160, which I took a screen shot of below.  When I look at the same card on EVGA's website, I'm now seeing that the MAX Resolution states: Max Digital: 2560x1600, which I took a screen shot from EVGA's website.  So which is it???  I'll hook it up to my 4k TV soon to see if it can output 2160, as it states in Amazon's description.**UPDATE**It appears Amazon has this card's resolution listed correctly and EVGA's website has it listed incorrectly.  To my relief, I hooked it up to my 4k TV and it displays a full 2160p, not only that but above and beyond to 4096x2160, as listed by Amazon.  It's only my first day using this card in my HTPC but so far I'm very impressed with streaming, granted neither Amazon or Netflix allows 4k streaming through Windows / PC platform, the upscaling through my receiver looks excellent.  Love the fact that it's fanless/noiseless.  Great buy for a budget HTPC build."", 'Für die Auswahl dieser Karte, die nicht gerade die schnellste ist, waren 3 Kriterien maßgebend. Erstens sollte sie 2 DVI Ausgänge besitzen, zweitens steht nur 1 Slot Breite zur Verfügung und drittens sollte auch noch Windows XP unterstützt werden. Da ich sie nicht für Spiele sondern nur für ""normale"" Büroarbeit benötige, ist deren Leistung für mich zufriedenstellend.Die darauf befindliche GPU GF108 ist noch in 40nm Technologie gefertigt und entspricht dem Stand von 2011. Die GT 730 wurde 2014 neu aufgelegt, ist aber leistungsschwächer als die GT 440 aus 2011. Der Unterschied liegt in der Taktrate, bzw. TDP. Die GT 440 hat eine TDP von 65W und die GT 730 eine von nur 49W, benötigt also weniger Kühlleistung. was sich positiv auf die Lebensdauer auswirkt.Mehr als 4 Sterne kann ich ihr nicht geben, da sie nicht dem aktuellen Stand der Technik entspricht.', 'So this card is kinda overkill for almost all games within the XP era...

So if you\'re reading this, buy the 4gb if/when possible for these occasions. Otherwise, it\'s perfect.Also, EVGA somehow managed to send me the wrong driver disc. I was given a 10-series (i.e. GTX 1050, 1060, 1070, etc..) driver disc. I wouldn\'t care normally, but I had only mobile data at the time and WinXP is not compatible with my phone\'s MTP settings... So I had to use my main PC, my phone and a flash drive instead of simply having the correct disc. Was a total pain.All-in-all, for my purposes, it is a great GPU and I wouldn\'t advise it for any purpose other than strictly Windows 2000-XP gaming. For the $55 I paid, it was quite a steal.

Súper recomendable.', 'I really really wanted to love this card.  All of the online reviews and videos said this was an overclockers dream card.  Had I known I only had to wait 4 months for the GTX 1080 I would have.  First of all let me talk about what I like.  The card is beautiful and hefty.  It oozes quality, from the packaging, the accessories, to the full copper block and RBG control.  EVGA did nail it with the looks and build of this card.  It commands a hefty price tag and is backed up by EVGA who in the past I have been quite pleased with.  Little did I know that less than one month later I would be RMAing it.  It started with the occasional lock up while under moderate loads.  Then it started locking up under virtually no load (just browsing and watching netflix) The whole screen would turn a solid color and the audio would freeze forcing me to manually restart my computer.  I was pulling my hair out trying to diagnose the problem.  I swapped PSU\'s and cables.  Ran stress tests on my CPU with PRIME95, monitored voltages with a multimeter, Ran MemTest86 and checked all of my RAM DIMMs, Even did a complete reinstall of windows 8.1.  The card was not overheating, my corsair Ax760i power supply was working perfectly, voltages and load were on point.  I purchased the Card on 2/19/16 and found myself submitting an RMA request on 4/2/16.  The RMA process I will say is very easy and EVGA has prompt response time in their technical support dept.  So $35 later cross shipping and insuring my package I got a ""brand new card"" which I promptly installed and it seemed to work just fine.  Well the new card hit the 50 day mark and the same pattern of behavior started again. Complete lock up\'s under load while my onboard video continued to work.  I thought certainly this must be something else.  I once again began pulling my hair out trying to figure this out.  Maybe its my other components?  They are on the older side (Ivy bridge i7 3770k CPU) (Asus Sabertooth Z77).  Was this 980ti too much for them?  I looked on the forums for anything and came up empty.  I finally reached out to EVGA technical support yesterday and got the ball rolling on yet ANOTHER RMA.  This will be TWO RMA\'s in less than 6 months.  For $850 (the price I paid originally) you would think the quality control on even a 72% ASICS for a flagship product would be outstanding.  I have no reason to believe that there is anything wrong with my system.  I have a Gigabyte GTX 970 G1 lying around and I immediately swapped it out and ran Furmark burn in test and Firestrike and it remained stable the whole time.  Now i know there is something wrong with the kingpin.  I now will have spent $70 on just shipping this thing cross country bringing the cost of ownership up to $920.  I could  have purchased two GTX 1070\'s for this cost.  I am really disappointed EVGA.  I\'ve built dozens of high end rigs and I\'ve never had to RMA two of the same cards ever let alone in the short time span of 4 months.  I understand that even the best products have some small percentage of failure rate.  But this is unacceptable.  I\'ve owned many EVGA products and have been very happy with them up until now.  This might be the last EVGA product I ever purchase.*EDIT* EVGA has at least offered to send me a prepaid shipping label for this latest RMA which I appreciate.  So once again their tech support and customer service is better than average.*EDIT 2* After the 3rd RMA card and the purchase of a new power supply this thing is rock solid.  The overclock is a little disappointing even for a 74% ASICS according to GPU-Z.  Ultimately you\'ll want to water cool or use LN2 for this card.  Upping to 3 stars, definitely some QC issues for this SKU which is surprising considering what the product is.', 'I normally buy GPU\'s towards the end of their lifecycle since I know the performance will usually be well-optimized by then.  I also always tend to go with EVGA\'s Classified line since they always build in a little ""extra"" headroom for overclocking and cooling.  I\'m coming from a pair of 780Ti Classifieds and I\'ve been very happy with those.  However upon seeing the Kingpins in stock, I went full retard and got a pair of them since everyone knows that they make your E-Peen bigger.  I wanted to find out for myself if that was true, and in fact, it is.  Getting two of them not only made my E-Peen bigger, but twice as large because these cards are not necessarily long, but they are girthy.  It\'s a proven fact that girth is better than length, and these cards deliver.In all seriousness, these are meant to be used by record-breaking overclockers using LN2 or Dry-Ice for cooling while pushing the volts.  I do none of that, however I achieved a linked 1400 core overclock and 1500 boost with no additional voltage using the OC Bios switch position.  I am air cooling at the moment.  I don\'t think I will watercool them because the stock cooler is beautiful and does a decent job with a generous fan profile.  I\'m not a benchmarker by any means, but rather enjoy the fluid frames and image quality these provide at 1440p.  Have not tried 4k as I don\'t have a 4k monitor, and honestly, 4k is not mature yet with current GPU\'s.  Give it a year, and with the TI-Version Pascals coming out end of 2016/17 perhaps we will be there.  I built an all-purpose workstation for photo/video editing, and utilizing a 40 lane CPU with a motherboard capable of 2x 16x PCIE-3 which ensures you have full access to all available PCIE bandwidth.  Would be a waste running two of these on 16x/8x motherboards to be honest.Ensure you have good airflow in your case, and you\'ll achieve decent overclocks on stock BIOS.  Switch it to OC or LN2 BIOS and you can achieve higher power targets and overclocks.  Honestly, unless you benchmark for world records, you will be better served with the Hybrid, SC, or Classified versions.  Still the highest performing/quality card you can get nowadays.  Image quality is phenomenal and coupled with a G-Sync monitor, you will be in heaven.', ""I had just built my first gaming PC a few days ago, I decided to go with this beast of a gpu, i7 4790k, and 16gb of ram. This 980 ti is an absolute monster, I'm so glad that I picked it for my build. So far Iv'e tried it with these games (completely maxed out on my 1080p 144hz monitor). Killing Floor 2, I averaged 150+ FPS, with the new Nvidia FleX setting enabled with just gore enabled I never went under 100 FPS even when things got crazy. And it never dipped below 80fps with gibs+liquid when things got crazy. Keep in mind that FleX is like a new PhysX and Killing Floor 2 is the first game to use it (plus Killing Floor 2 is in early access at the moment) FleX is not fully optimized yet but still runs completely smooth on this card. Payday 2, well that game is just easy to run on any PC, I ran it maxed out on my crappy laptop before I built my rig so nothing really to say about that besides it runs flawlessly. And I tried out Hatred, which is a very poorly optimized game that even the Devs tell people not to play on Max settings for the best experience at the moment. It's running on the new Unreal 4 engine, and I wanted to see how my card handled it. Completely maxed out I averaged 80-100 fps, when things got absolutely crazy like bodies everywhere, buildings on fire and blowing up, hail of bullets flying everywhere I'd dip to 45-50 fps. Still smooth, playable, and like I said that game is very poorly optimized. I have Battlefield 4 downloading at the moment, maybe I'll update my post and let you guys know how that runs, but before I bought all my hardware to build my PC I looked on YouTube for benchmarks and BF4 seemed to average 150 fps maxed out with this gpu. I personally recommend this card to anyone looking for a card that will run their games now and for a long time on Ultra with high fps and has the money to do so."", 'The product was delivered ultra fast , only 7-8 days US to Greece , with relatively cheap shipping costs!Now , as for the product itself whats more there is to say rather that its one of the best graphics cards to date , miles ahead of the newly introduced Fury X.Great work Nvidia . once again.UPDATED ON USAGE :20 days of extensive usage just proved the \'best card on the market"" statement.4K Gaming only , on a i75820k cpu with 16gb ram and on highest setrtings available ( Just anything that has to do with AA is disabled - you dont need it in 4k after all ).FPS varies on game and driver but never drops bellow 30-33 in most cases.On average i could say that the FPS are about 37-40 with highs on the 48-53 range and lows on 30-32 and in extreme cases on 28-29 ( varies on the display driver though ).The Display Driver i currently use is not 353.30 but the 353.38  (i had some crushes with 353.30 ).OS is Win8.1 64 , i havent updated yet to Win10 , i think i might give is some time yet.GPU Overclocking is done by the MSI Afterburner , +130 to both core and memory. Works well.

Nvidia Hairworks OFF, AO SSAOAverage 38-40Low:28High:50Bottom Line,This card CAN do 4k gaming a playable reality , no need to get a  2560*1440 monitor if you are afraid of any performance issues.Just combine this with a 4K Monitor and IF you are not satisfied lower the res to 2560*1440 ( there is a tremendous performance leap this way almost constant 60fps on a ASUS PB287Q monitor (no gsync , max refresh rate 60hz ) .Hope this helps guys. :) Go For It.', ""Some of these resellers are crazy. Charging 800+ for this graphics card?! If you're willing to spend anything over the MSRP for these cards do yourself a favor, go to nvidia.com and buy the Titan x. These cards by evga go for 650-680 right now. That's not including the hybrid, classified, hydro chopper, or kingpin, which at the time I'm writing this aren't listed or available.Don't pay anything over the listed prices on evga.com. Check nowinstock.net and check the evga website. These cards are being restocked continuously. Or, wait a few more weeks and these cards will be easier to get without over paying.I bought two reference cards, good solid cards running in sli. I'm not a big fan of the gold accents on the acx 2.0 cards so unless I'm hitting some real issues with cooling I think I'll keep the reference models. So far I have been only running at 1080p and these cards are overkill for that. But, I'm planning to upgrade in my display in a few months.If you plan to play at 4k these cards are a great value for the performance you'll get, check out a few benchmarks online. They perform almost as well as the Titan x and for a lot cheaper. Overall I'm happy with my purchase and can't wait to see what else I can throw at these."", ""Very  happy with this card.I'm not an over-clocker........I just wanted a card that could handle all my gaming needs and this one more than satisfies the need.I liked it so much I decided to get two and run them in the sli configuration.  (yeah,  I'm a bit nuts)I had 2 GeForce 770's in sli that I was happy with, buton certain games like falcon 4 and bf4 they would stumble a bit, so I decided to give the kingpin a try.The kingpins cut through games like a machete.  I love the look of the pure copper.....really makes the card standout.The cooling system works great and the temp never goes beyond 50c.  Since I'm not overclocking, air cooling is just fine for me.The colored nameplates and status indicators are also a nice touch.I know I will never realize this cards  full capability without overclocking, but its nice to have something of quality in this day and age of the almighty dollar first and quality second.Also, kudos to Evga for taking the time to present an elegant and well packaged card.Don't know how I'm going to make nextmonths rent payment, but we will worry about that then. :)"", ""This review is for the 72 % Asic quality rated Kingpin 980-Ti by EVGA. Been wanting to buy a Kingpin for a while and held off until the price was more reasonable than before. I would have preferred a higher ASIC quality rated card but couldn't justify the cost. Fortunately as luck would have it I didn't get a 72% Asic card at all.  Truthfully I haven't yet run this card through the paces yet or overclocked it yet. Planning on water cooling it sooner or later as I already have the block ready to go and had read that for water cooling 74% Asic is where its at. Good thing that the card I got was a 75% Asic according to GPUZ. Guess EVGA must have been out of 72% Asic that day the card was assembled and threw in a better Asic chip in there instead. Lucky me. Anyhow first impressions are that EVGA spared no expense in presentation as the card arrives sitting pretty in foam in a very nice slick looking black box wrapped up in another nice brown card-board box with all the accessories you could possibly need including a poster and XL T-Shirt. So so far so good."", ""Here it is three years later and I'm waiting for my 4th replacement card. EVGA has been great on the RMA process but each time it's cost me between $18.00 to $25.00 to ship the dead card back.It’s used in a ASUS Rampage V Extreme motherboard running an Intel i7-5960x CPU. Power for the system is a CoolerMaster RS-C50-EMBA-D2 1250w power supply.While I’m waiting for the replacement card on the RMA I’m running dual eVGA GTX680’s in SLI and all is well.  What I’ve seen in the failures is both cards will cause a system failure requiring a reboot of the system. It doesn’t lock up, you’ll be working and all of a sudden the system will reboot.On the first card the next symptom was I lost video out on my second monitor. I had to move it from a display port connection to a DVI port and was able to get both monitors working again but the instant reboot continued. If I ran a stress test or benchmark using OC Scanner X the system would always reboot.On the last card I received I saw this behavior again but within a week instead of reboot I’d get a hard lockup.  My main monitor would go to power save and the second monitor would have a fixed bright color. Then in its dyeing breath the system rebooted and the video never came back on.If I run CPU and GPU testing together with the GTX680’s the system is stable and I’m running them now as I write this email. The 5960 cpu never runs of breath even when it’s running at 100%.I’m running the Kingpin at stock speeds, temps and voltages. I don’t have a need to overclock it and the voltages from the power supply are stable."", ""The K|ngp|n is an amazing card. The build quality is excellent - heavy, solid construction. And very sleek looking. This card is designed for overclocking, keep that in mind as you can find other graphics cards that offer comparable performance less the cost. Although the next generation of Nvidia GPUs are available, I selected this GPU due to its aesthetic design and high quality components (also snagged a like - new condition for $330 :D). Currently, I have this card Core Clock overclocked to 1577MHz without any voltage adjust and air cooled. I don't doubt with a custom loop and voltage adjust I can hit 1600MHz. My ASIC sore is 80.4% as well, which was a great surprise since it only needed to be above 72% as advertised. Lastly, this is a unique card in its design and purpose - so it is also great to keep as a collector's item as well.""]"

Definitely a significant improvement over integrated graphics, allowing your PC to clock higher FPS on higher graphics settings. No more frame freeze!Do your research before you buy though, it may save you a lot of hassle; and, don\'t expect it to give you 50+ frames outdoors on high settings. It won\'t, and it shouldn\'t be expected to. It will give you about 15-20 FPS though. I can see what\'s happening and the image isn\'t jumping around, which is good enough for me.1. First, look up your PC\'s specs (if it is a premade stock--if custom built you may need to open it up to look). Make sure your PSU is at least 300 watts, which is recommended for this product.2. You\'ll also need a PCIe x16 expansion slot, which is where the new card will go.3. Look at the back of the display device you plan to use with this card and check to see if it has a port that matches the type of output options your card has, which is DVI-I most of time. This is fully compatible with a DVI-D monitor (not sure if there are any versions of this product with a DVI-D output but if so DVI-D will not be compatible with an analog or DVI-A port). If your monitor only has a VGA input, you\'ll need to purchase a DVI to VGA adapter. I would recommend getting a DVI-I or DVI-D adapter--DVI-A will work but the video will not be as high quality.4. Finally, find out if your PC uses Secure Boot--if so, you\'ll probably need to turn it off in BIOS. Search the web for instructions on how to enter your PC\'s bootloader and switch to Legacy Boot. On most Windows 8/8.1/10 systems, Shift+Click the restart button in the power menu to reboot your machine to the boot settings menu. Click ""Troubleshoot"", then UEFI, then restart. Different manufacturers will have slightly different BIOS UIs, but look for something that says ""Security"" with options to enable/disable Secure Boot and Legacy Boot. You\'ll want to disable Secure and enable Legacy, then make sure you save your settings before you exit.Once you have done that and booted to the normal desktop, your screen\'s resolution may have reverted to 1024 x 768 or some extremely low and awkward looking setting. Do not panic, this behavior is expected. Insert the disc provided in the package, or if you do not have an optical drive you may need to visit EVGA\'s website to see if you can find the driver and download it from there. If you used the disc, open up your file explorer and double click the disc drive to run it and bring up the autoplay menu. You\'ll need to install the graphics card driver and DirectX, the other applications are optional. Once the driver has been installed, your screen should return to its normal resolution.Finally, a nod to EVGA\'s customer support, which is as everyone else has been saying, amazing. 24/7 tech support, and not some person with a thick accent who is difficult to understand. The unit I purchased was a dual-DVI version, and one of the ports (the one I tried first of course), wasn\'t working. The agent didn\'t think to ask about that but I figured it out on my own. They offered to RMA, though I declined for the time being since I don\'t even own another display device with which to make use of the other port. But the card does come with a 3-year warranty, which is awesome, so if I ever decide I do want to use the other port, I could just have it replaced as long as it\'s within the next few years. On top of all that, they had the customer service manager follow up with me personally through email after I left comments in the feedback survey. I don\'t think I\'ve ever before known a company to actually do that. Really impressive service, in fact probably some of the best I\'ve ever seen. A+.', ""Oh, where to start. First of all, my PC is a HP Pavilion p6110f, which this GC upgraded for me.Introduction: The EVGA Graphics card is a good upgrade for those on a old Computer such as a 2009 based PC. It's easy to plug into a PC using PCI express, and works very well on any pc with that one thing. However, there are certain flaws a gamer and PC enthusiast should be aware of.Design Choices: The Design of my model of the Graphics Card has a large heatsink. This makes it difficult and impossible for me to install another GT 730. Its fine in my honest opinion, but the idea of having a fan for less space makes me want to replace this card with that.Hidden Costs: Oh yes, this has them. First of all, if you're upgrading a PC from the early 2000's, or anytime before PCI express, you have to upgrade the motherboard! Now, I had the luck to avoid that problem, for my motherboard has 1 PCI express x16 slot, but its a hidden cost for people who are using a old PC. Second hidden cost is Power. Most PC's have a 250 Power supply, which was sufficiant for my PC, but if you don't have 300watts, you're not pushing the Graphics card to it's limits. What I mean is, it does work with 250 watts, but for a gaming rig, it's not fully pushed to its potential. So, thats another hidden cost TO A GAMER.My Experience: The Graphics card was easy to install, drivers breezed through. However, 2 months after I recieved this, (Yes, don't ask why I review it now) My HDMI port dies on me, making it impossible to have a TV/PC monitor combo, a small loss, but it sucks a bit for video editing.Overall: The GT730 Graphics Card is a nice upgrade, but for gaming,  I suggest a more expensive card, such as the 970 for gaming builds."", ""Good product but don't buy mini hdmi adapter because it won't fit on card due to position of port on the card"", ""I haven't really noticed a lot of improvement over my old ATI X800 XT considered to be one of the top graphic cards back in 2004.  The EVGA, however, will allow me to upgrade to a more current Windows operating system.  When I used Windows 7 Advisor I was informed the old card would not be compatible.  Now the old Dell XPS Gen 3 Pentium IV is compatible.  It has met my needs in this respect.  Also the EVGA was reasonably priced so that I would not have to put too much money into an old Desktop.  I will say that this old Dell has been the best computer I've owned and I've owned computers since 1982 when I used Microsoft DOS 1.0 on a single floppy disk.  There is really a lot you can do with older computers to improve speed and overall performance.  I have 2 other household computers running Windows 10 and would eventually like to have all 3 on network together.  I believe the EVGA is a worthwhile purchase and I recognize their are graphics cards far superior in speed and function.  If my old computer would handle a more powerful card I might have purchased a more expensive card.  I may actually be underrating the EVGA as I just installed the card today.  Thank goodness it was compatible with my old 2004 Dell having one of the first PCI-e slots.  Notice I said only 1 as the rest of the slots are PCI without the PCI-e.  The benchmark ratings on the GeForce GT 730 2GB DDR3 128 bit are good in comparison with similarly priced graphic cards."", ""i have had this card ten months,and this card is excellent card even though it is a passive cooling 64 bit card it performs superb,and uses fits half in your pci-e slot bit . but i use it in a dell 780 dt model w/ 4gb memory,win 10,and 255 watts of power,and it fits fine.its heat sink is wide. so make sure you have two pci slots free. i use it mostly  for pc gaming and media streaming like netflix,hulu,and etc. it gives me a 9.9 win score on 3d and gaming. it played all of my games with win 10 smoothly,and faster more on high.or ultra settings settings,and no lags,or problems. it never went pass 85 C during heavy game play with lots of things going on,and it performed excellent. it also give you good hd with hd montior during media viewing,and movie watching. overall it is a great entry level gaming card for low power pc's like mine. so far it taking everything i throw at it. the card does not overheat,and is quiet . i tested it with msi kombustor 3d at 98-100 % load its temp reached 90 c and leveled out at a steady 90 c then cooled down quick as a fan cooled card. i overclocked it some,and it ran good then i set it back to its normal .you can over clock it runs a few degrees hotter,and good. but it works just fine at default speed. you are skeptical cause its only pci-e x8,and no fan then your wrong. the heatsink works as good as the fan,and it will not break or stop as a fan it. this passive cool card is good for gaming,and if you have a good processor and memory. it will rock your games,and great hd video,and media playing. once installed if working properly you will see a change in performance immediately. best affordable entry level gaming card,and is passive cooled."", ""I needed this for a server that only had room for a low profile card and it fit perfectly.  It draws under 25w on boot which is ideal for systems that are picky about limited power draw on startup i.e., older dell enterprise servers.  It includes a tiny bracket you can use if you don't need the VGA port.  The heatsink does what it should as the card doesn't get unreasonably hot - just make sure you have some direct airflow over the heatsink.You'll struggle to play many new games on this card, it's not fast, it's not pretty, and it has no fan.  However it's compact in size and is ideal for a workstation or basic server GPU.My only complaint applies to Amazon rather than the card itself.  Amazon just placed the card and its thin factory box into a brown envelope with only minimal insulation against shipping damage.  The box arrived somewhat crushed although somehow the card wasn't damaged.  This should have been shipped inside a cardboard Amazon box rather than a paper envelope."", ""I just installed the GT 730 in a HP 8200 Elite SFF, it was plug and play, detected immediately upon booting up with DVI cable hooked up to a monitor.  I didn't need to disable the onboard video card or make any changes in the bios, so I'll assume it runs this card beside / in addition to the onboard, however, note that with the huge, tall heat sink it covers the additional PCIE slot above it, rendering that expansion slot useless.  I haven't been able to test it yet on my 4k TV yet.  But looking through the description on Amazon, which was my key factor in purchasing this card, it states the MAX Resolution for the 02G-P3-1733-KR is: Max Digital: 4096x2160, which I took a screen shot of below.  When I look at the same card on EVGA's website, I'm now seeing that the MAX Resolution states: Max Digital: 2560x1600, which I took a screen shot from EVGA's website.  So which is it???  I'll hook it up to my 4k TV soon to see if it can output 2160, as it states in Amazon's description.**UPDATE**It appears Amazon has this card's resolution listed correctly and EVGA's website has it listed incorrectly.  To my relief, I hooked it up to my 4k TV and it displays a full 2160p, not only that but above and beyond to 4096x2160, as listed by Amazon.  It's only my first day using this card in my HTPC but so far I'm very impressed with streaming, granted neither Amazon or Netflix allows 4k streaming through Windows / PC platform, the upscaling through my receiver looks excellent.  Love the fact that it's fanless/noiseless.  Great buy for a budget HTPC build."", 'Für die Auswahl dieser Karte, die nicht gerade die schnellste ist, waren 3 Kriterien maßgebend. Erstens sollte sie 2 DVI Ausgänge besitzen, zweitens steht nur 1 Slot Breite zur Verfügung und drittens sollte auch noch Windows XP unterstützt werden. Da ich sie nicht für Spiele sondern nur für ""normale"" Büroarbeit benötige, ist deren Leistung für mich zufriedenstellend.Die darauf befindliche GPU GF108 ist noch in 40nm Technologie gefertigt und entspricht dem Stand von 2011. Die GT 730 wurde 2014 neu aufgelegt, ist aber leistungsschwächer als die GT 440 aus 2011. Der Unterschied liegt in der Taktrate, bzw. TDP. Die GT 440 hat eine TDP von 65W und die GT 730 eine von nur 49W, benötigt also weniger Kühlleistung. was sich positiv auf die Lebensdauer auswirkt.Mehr als 4 Sterne kann ich ihr nicht geben, da sie nicht dem aktuellen Stand der Technik entspricht.', 'So this card is kinda overkill for almost all games within the XP era... However, in trying Quake 4, I ran into an issue with AA above 4x. I Realized that in this particular game, 2gb of RAM is not enough. Even for XP. So if you\'re reading this, buy the 4gb if/when possible for these occasions. Otherwise, it\'s perfect.Also, EVGA somehow managed to send me the wrong driver disc. I was given a 10-series (i.e. GTX 1050, 1060, 1070, etc..) driver disc. I wouldn\'t care normally, but I had only mobile data at the time and WinXP is not compatible with my phone\'s MTP settings... So I had to use my main PC, my phone and a flash drive instead of simply having the correct disc. Was a total pain.All-in-all, for my purposes, it is a great GPU and I wouldn\'t advise it for any purpose other than strictly Windows 2000-XP gaming. For the $55 I paid, it was quite a steal.

Súper recomendable.', 'I really really wanted to love this card.  All of the online reviews and videos said this was an overclockers dream card.  Had I known I only had to wait 4 months for the GTX 1080 I would have.  First of all let me talk about what I like.  The card is beautiful and hefty.  It oozes quality, from the packaging, the accessories, to the full copper block and RBG control.  EVGA did nail it with the looks and build of this card.  It commands a hefty price tag and is backed up by EVGA who in the past I have been quite pleased with.  Little did I know that less than one month later I would be RMAing it.  It started with the occasional lock up while under moderate loads.  Then it started locking up under virtually no load (just browsing and watching netflix) The whole screen would turn a solid color and the audio would freeze forcing me to manually restart my computer.  I was pulling my hair out trying to diagnose the problem.  I swapped PSU\'s and cables.  Ran stress tests on my CPU with PRIME95, monitored voltages with a multimeter, Ran MemTest86 and checked all of my RAM DIMMs, Even did a complete reinstall of windows 8.1.  The card was not overheating, my corsair Ax760i power supply was working perfectly, voltages and load were on point.  I purchased the Card on 2/19/16 and found myself submitting an RMA request on 4/2/16.  The RMA process I will say is very easy and EVGA has prompt response time in their technical support dept.  So $35 later cross shipping and insuring my package I got a ""brand new card"" which I promptly installed and it seemed to work just fine.  Well the new card hit the 50 day mark and the same pattern of behavior started again. Complete lock up\'s under load while my onboard video continued to work.  I thought certainly this must be something else.  I once again began pulling my hair out trying to figure this out.  Maybe its my other components?  They are on the older side (Ivy bridge i7 3770k CPU) (Asus Sabertooth Z77).  Was this 980ti too much for them?  I looked on the forums for anything and came up empty.  I finally reached out to EVGA technical support yesterday and got the ball rolling on yet ANOTHER RMA.  This will be TWO RMA\'s in less than 6 months.  For $850 (the price I paid originally) you would think the quality control on even a 72% ASICS for a flagship product would be outstanding.  I have no reason to believe that there is anything wrong with my system.  I have a Gigabyte GTX 970 G1 lying around and I immediately swapped it out and ran Furmark burn in test and Firestrike and it remained stable the whole time.  Now i know there is something wrong with the kingpin.  I now will have spent $70 on just shipping this thing cross country bringing the cost of ownership up to $920.  I could  have purchased two GTX 1070\'s for this cost.  I am really disappointed EVGA.  I\'ve built dozens of high end rigs and I\'ve never had to RMA two of the same cards ever let alone in the short time span of 4 months.  I understand that even the best products have some small percentage of failure rate.  But this is unacceptable.  I\'ve owned many EVGA products and have been very happy with them up until now.  This might be the last EVGA product I ever purchase.*EDIT* EVGA has at least offered to send me a prepaid shipping label for this latest RMA which I appreciate.  So once again their tech support and customer service is better than average.*EDIT 2* After the 3rd RMA card and the purchase of a new power supply this thing is rock solid.  The overclock is a little disappointing even for a 74% ASICS according to GPU-Z.  Ultimately you\'ll want to water cool or use LN2 for this card.  Upping to 3 stars, definitely some QC issues for this SKU which is surprising considering what the product is.', 'I normally buy GPU\'s towards the end of their lifecycle since I know the performance will usually be well-optimized by then.  I also always tend to go with EVGA\'s Classified line since they always build in a little ""extra"" headroom for overclocking and cooling.  I\'m coming from a pair of 780Ti Classifieds and I\'ve been very happy with those.  However upon seeing the Kingpins in stock, I went full retard and got a pair of them since everyone knows that they make your E-Peen bigger.  I wanted to find out for myself if that was true, and in fact, it is.  Getting two of them not only made my E-Peen bigger, but twice as large because these cards are not necessarily long, but they are girthy.  It\'s a proven fact that girth is better than length, and these cards deliver.In all seriousness, these are meant to be used by record-breaking overclockers using LN2 or Dry-Ice for cooling while pushing the volts.  I do none of that, however I achieved a linked 1400 core overclock and 1500 boost with no additional voltage using the OC Bios switch position.  I am air cooling at the moment.  I don\'t think I will watercool them because the stock cooler is beautiful and does a decent job with a generous fan profile.  I\'m not a benchmarker by any means, but rather enjoy the fluid frames and image quality these provide at 1440p.  Have not tried 4k as I don\'t have a 4k monitor, and honestly, 4k is not mature yet with current GPU\'s.  Give it a year, and with the TI-Version Pascals coming out end of 2016/17 perhaps we will be there.  I built an all-purpose workstation for photo/video editing, and utilizing a 40 lane CPU with a motherboard capable of 2x 16x PCIE-3 which ensures you have full access to all available PCIE bandwidth.  Would be a waste running two of these on 16x/8x motherboards to be honest.Ensure you have good airflow in your case, and you\'ll achieve decent overclocks on stock BIOS.  Switch it to OC or LN2 BIOS and you can achieve higher power targets and overclocks.  Honestly, unless you benchmark for world records, you will be better served with the Hybrid, SC, or Classified versions.  Still the highest performing/quality card you can get nowadays.  Image quality is phenomenal and coupled with a G-Sync monitor, you will be in heaven.', ""I had just built my first gaming PC a few days ago, I decided to go with this beast of a gpu, i7 4790k, and 16gb of ram. This 980 ti is an absolute monster, I'm so glad that I picked it for my build. So far Iv'e tried it with these games (completely maxed out on my 1080p 144hz monitor). Killing Floor 2, I averaged 150+ FPS, with the new Nvidia FleX setting enabled with just gore enabled I never went under 100 FPS even when things got crazy. And it never dipped below 80fps with gibs+liquid when things got crazy. Keep in mind that FleX is like a new PhysX and Killing Floor 2 is the first game to use it (plus Killing Floor 2 is in early access at the moment) FleX is not fully optimized yet but still runs completely smooth on this card. Payday 2, well that game is just easy to run on any PC, I ran it maxed out on my crappy laptop before I built my rig so nothing really to say about that besides it runs flawlessly. And I tried out Hatred, which is a very poorly optimized game that even the Devs tell people not to play on Max settings for the best experience at the moment. It's running on the new Unreal 4 engine, and I wanted to see how my card handled it. Completely maxed out I averaged 80-100 fps, when things got absolutely crazy like bodies everywhere, buildings on fire and blowing up, hail of bullets flying everywhere I'd dip to 45-50 fps. Still smooth, playable, and like I said that game is very poorly optimized. I have Battlefield 4 downloading at the moment, maybe I'll update my post and let you guys know how that runs, but before I bought all my hardware to build my PC I looked on YouTube for benchmarks and BF4 seemed to average 150 fps maxed out with this gpu. I personally recommend this card to anyone looking for a card that will run their games now and for a long time on Ultra with high fps and has the money to do so."", 'The product was delivered ultra fast , only 7-8 days US to Greece , with relatively cheap shipping costs!Now , as for the product itself whats more there is to say rather that its one of the best graphics cards to date , miles ahead of the newly introduced Fury X.Great work Nvidia . once again.UPDATED ON USAGE :20 days of extensive usage just proved the \'best card on the market"" statement.4K Gaming only , on a i75820k cpu with 16gb ram and on highest setrtings available ( Just anything that has to do with AA is disabled - you dont need it in 4k after all ).FPS varies on game and driver but never drops bellow 30-33 in most cases.On average i could say that the FPS are about 37-40 with highs on the 48-53 range and lows on 30-32 and in extreme cases on 28-29 ( varies on the display driver though ).The Display Driver i currently use is not 353.30 but the 353.38  (i had some crushes with 353.30 ).OS is Win8.1 64 , i havent updated yet to Win10 , i think i might give is some time yet.GPU Overclocking is done by the MSI Afterburner , +130 to both core and memory.

I love the look of the pure copper.....really makes the card standout.The cooling system works great and the temp never goes beyond 50c.  Since I'm not overclocking, air cooling is just fine for me.The colored nameplates and status indicators are also a nice touch.I know I will never realize this cards  full capability without overclocking, but its nice to have something of quality in this day and age of the almighty dollar first and quality second.Also, kudos to Evga for taking the time to present an elegant and well packaged card.Don't know how I'm going to make nextmonths rent payment, but we will worry about that then. :)"", ""This review is for the 72 % Asic quality rated Kingpin 980-Ti by EVGA. Been wanting to buy a Kingpin for a while and held off until the price was more reasonable than before. I would have preferred a higher ASIC quality rated card but couldn't justify the cost. Fortunately as luck would have it I didn't get a 72% Asic card at all.  Truthfully I haven't yet run this card through the paces yet or overclocked it yet. Planning on water cooling it sooner or later as I already have the block ready to go and had read that for water cooling 74% Asic is where its at. Good thing that the card I got was a 75% Asic according to GPUZ. Guess EVGA must have been out of 72% Asic that day the card was assembled and threw in a better Asic chip in there instead. Lucky me. Anyhow first impressions are that EVGA spared no expense in presentation as the card arrives sitting pretty in foam in a very nice slick looking black box wrapped up in another nice brown card-board box with all the accessories you could possibly need including a poster and XL T-Shirt. So so far so good."", ""Here it is three years later and I'm waiting for my 4th replacement card. EVGA has been great on the RMA process but each time it's cost me between $18.00 to $25.00 to ship the dead card back.It’s used in a ASUS Rampage V Extreme motherboard running an Intel i7-5960x CPU. Power for the system is a CoolerMaster RS-C50-EMBA-D2 1250w power supply.While I’m waiting for the replacement card on the RMA I’m running dual eVGA GTX680’s in SLI and all is well.  What I’ve seen in the failures is both cards will cause a system failure requiring a reboot of the system. It doesn’t lock up, you’ll be working and all of a sudden the system will reboot.On the first card the next symptom was I lost video out on my second monitor. I had to move it from a display port connection to a DVI port and was able to get both monitors working again but the instant reboot continued. If I ran a stress test or benchmark using OC Scanner X the system would always reboot.On the last card I received I saw this behavior again but within a week instead of reboot I’d get a hard lockup.  My main monitor would go to power save and the second monitor would have a fixed bright color. Then in its dyeing breath the system rebooted and the video never came back on.If I run CPU and GPU testing together with the GTX680’s the system is stable and I’m running them now as I write this email. The 5960 cpu never runs of breath even when it’s running at 100%.I’m running the Kingpin at stock speeds, temps and voltages. I don’t have a need to overclock it and the voltages from the power supply are stable."", ""The K|ngp|n is an amazing card. The build quality is excellent - heavy, solid construction. And very sleek looking. This card is designed for overclocking, keep that in mind as you can find other graphics cards that offer comparable performance less the cost. Although the next generation of Nvidia GPUs are available, I selected this GPU due to its aesthetic design and high quality components (also snagged a like - new condition for $330 :D). Currently, I have this card Core Clock overclocked to 1577MHz without any voltage adjust and air cooled. I don't doubt with a custom loop and voltage adjust I can hit 1600MHz. My ASIC sore is 80.4% as well, which was a great surprise since it only needed to be above 72% as advertised. Lastly, this is a unique card in its design and purpose - so it is also great to keep as a collector's item as well.""]"

I have about 15 of them on various office machines. I have one 6 monitor, two 4 monitor and one 6 monitor cards.  They are great for a business environment needing multiple monitors. For gaming there are more powerful  alternatives. However they are lacking in their connectors. Their 3 monitor card has a flimsy 3 way splitter that easily bends the socket or breaks the screws so I was delighted when their 4 and 6 monitor cards had mini-Display-Port (MDP) sockets.  The problem is their adapters.  Most monitors today have HDMI and DVI ports only. Few have Display Ports (DP).  The good news is that their ports are Active.  Active ports have power to support circuitry that converts on port type to another. However their 6 monitor card provides only MDP-to-DP adapters and their 4 monitor card only includes two MDP-to-DP and two MDP-to-DVI adapters.  If like most of us you have HDMI monitors, you have to buy their Active MDP-to-HDMI adapters or a quality aftermarket one.Their tech support department which is pretty responsive by email said their cards will support two adapters or cables that are not active. A non-active adapter such as a cable with HDMI on one side and DP on the other side will work but only for 2 of the 4 or 6 monitors respectively depending on the card.There are a couple other things.- They make these wonderfully engineered adapters with a screw-down screw so that they do not pull out of the card but the screw-down adapters are only available with a new card. They do not sell the screw-down versions à la carte and the Active MDP-to-HDMI which do not ship with the cards are not manufactured with screw downs. So if you have 4 or 6 of those plugged in on the respective board.- If you decide to go DVI, you can at least have one screw-down adapter.  Having one is a huge help because you can zip tie the others that have no screw-down to it and keep them from falling out of the board.  However DVI plugs are not particularly good for snaking up the pipe on a multi-monitor stand.My suggestion to VisionTek is to sell the screw down adapters à la carte and ship the units with all MDP to HDMI adapters or sell them with 2-3 HDMI ports (because 4-6 won’t fit on most cards) that support “Y” cables. That way 2 HDMI ports with 2 “Y”s would support 4 monitors and and 3 HDMI ports with 3 “Y”s would support 6 monitors respectively.So the bottom line is that if you want to do it right, you need 4 or 6 Active MDP-to-HDMI adapters preferably Vision Tek brand.  So plan on spending $25 each or $100 extra for the 4 monitor card and $150 extra for the 6 video card.  Also plan on having no screw downs; a great feature gone to waste.', ""I decided to add a third monitor to my server and after much research, chose the VisionTek Products Radeon 7750 SFF 2GB GDDR5 card.  I installed it and had difficulties loading the included driver on the included CD so I defaulted to Windows 10 drivers.  2 weeks late I discovered that Amazon had dropped the price on this card by nearly $70 so I called customer service.  I was told the only way to get the card for the lower price was to return the original card and reorder it at the lower price.  This is exactly what I did and the next day my new card arrived.  Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and discovered that the new card was a totally different card.  I immediately called the manufacturer to determine what was going on.I was told that my original card was an older card that had been replaced by the newer version.  In the enclosed pictures the older card has the letter V on the fan while the newer version includes the entire name VisionTek on the fan.  The newer version also came with updated drivers on a CD.  After installing the newer card I tried loading the new drivers and discovered that the Window 10 drivers worked better than the ones provided by VisionTek.  I also discovered the next day that there were video driver updates available from Microsoft that were dated less than 2 weeks earlier.Thus, I am now running 3 monitors on my VisionTek 7750 graphic card utilizing Windows 10's latest drivers and loving the enhanced speed and versatility of 3 monitors."", 'I’m going to write a detailed technical review here in the hopes that I can save somebody some time. My own mistakes cost me about two days.For personal reasons I recently consolidated three offices into one. Two of the offices had double monitors, one high-definition and one VGA. With the consolidation I ended up with many monitors and more computers that I have hands to operate. I decided to dispose of the computers and take the monitors and build myself a machine that had three high-definition monitors attached to it. I bought this card. First the basics. Digital standards for monitor video are HDMI, DisplayPort, and DVI. All these digital standards will run high-definition monitors well. The analog standard for video is VGA. I wasn’t happy with the quality of VGA with a large high definition widescreen monitor so I bought this card to get digital outputs for all the monitors. Now here’s where it gets tricky. DisplayPort is inherently an “active” standard, HDMI and DVI are inherently “passive.” Only two passive devices are allowed by Microsoft Windows. Since I do not own Displayport monitors, only HDMI and DVI, I had to purchase an “Active” mini-DisplayPort to DVI adapter to make my third monitor work. The first two monitors worked with mini-Displayport to HDMI adapters that were passive. The mini-Displayport to DVI adapters that are included with this card are passive.I still don’t understand the difference between active and passive adapters except the active adapters are about twice as expensive. But if you are like me you will need to add an active adapter to replace the passive DVI adapter found in the box.By the way I figured this out by calling this company’s tech support and they answered my question about 60 seconds. They gave me a part number I put it in Amazon and ordered the part before I even hung up the phone. This company’s technical support is wonderful, and a time when that is getting harder to find. It’s great that a company can answer the phone with a real person who fixes your problem right away.Other things about this card is it does come with a full size back panel adapter. You can change that out in about one minute. It was very easy to install, Windows found everything right away and it worked and now I have a browser in one display, word processor in the second, and email in the third. The fan noise is minimal. Nerdvana!', 'Bought this about 4 months ago.  Works great.  I\'ve got four 24"" monitors, and all work just fine.  I don\'t run high intensity games.  I do run Photoshop and Illustrator.Lots of confusion by people who think they can plug in anything and it will work.  Basically, you need to have a monitor with digital input, like DVI or DP.  If you use non-digital inputs, like VGA, then you can only connect 2 monitors max (also, I could not get HDMI to work... maybe a cable issue).  Ditto if you use an adapter or cable that is not ""active"".  But, if you use proper cables, then everything works just fine.That said, finding the right cable or adapter is a bit of a challenge.  Here are a couple of items that are reasonably priced and that worked for me: (the card has mini-DP out, so I\'m listing only the other connection)DVI : https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EDSZYIIDP  : https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01J9SIBCCNote the manufacturer is the same on both items.Some side-notes on monitors.  Invariably, if you buy this card, you\'re probably going to buy some monitors, too...o Shop around.  I found 24"" Dell monitors for $89 in Dec \'16--but not on Amazon!o Buy branded monitors.  Off brands have issues: Bezel buttons don\'t work well or wear out quickly; Colors are off; other weird stuff: monitors with VESA mounts that do not allow full removal of the pedestal.  I\'ve bought a few of these myself.  There\'s a reason why I now stick to branded stuff on this one.o All your monitiors should be the same brand and model--trust me, I\'ve tried the buy one here and another one there (that\'s why I know what connectors work), but different brands always will display colors differently and at different brightness.o Look at product close-ups for where the power and adjustment buttons are.  I bought Benq before--great monitors & colors, but the power button is on the right side, around the bezel edge.  So, if you put two of these next to each other, the right one will cover up the left one\'s power button.  Trust me, this gets annoying very quickly.o Bezel thickness matters!  When you build a 4 or 6 monitor system, the thinner the bezel, the better it all looks in the end.', ""when I installed, it worked fine for one monitor, once I installed the drivers, windows kept booting with no video, til I booted in safe mode and fiddled with it, to get 2 more monitors working, I had to change to dvi cables, the ones I used on the old card didn't work anymore... so it took a couple hours, but it's up and running now, glad I had spare cables..."", 'fast delivery and ok product', 'I had to spend about 3-4 hours just trying to get the drivers installed. It\'s a VisionTek product but AMD supplies the drivers, I\'m not sure why this is. AMD didn\'t list the driver for this model, but the auto-detect software can find it. Unfortunately, I had to go through hours of troubleshooting steps with windows just to get the drivers installed. Once I finally had them installed, I was able to setup my 4 monitor display, no problems.Others already mentioned it, but just in case - if you\'re using any Windows OS, make sure you have at least two active display outputs. Displayport is already active, but if you\'re using VGA, DVI-I, DVI-D or HDMI you\'re going to have to get at least two ""active"" adapters.', 'Must have 2 active adapters to run 4 monitors. They do not tell you this anywhere.  It took me 4 days to figure it out. Called tech support and I was right. Now with 2 passive and 2 active adapters it works Amazing!', 'First, this does indeed support four monitors.  However, you will need to buy ""Active"" adapters if you want good 4k video quality.  The included adapters are passive.  You will also need to buy these if you want to support more than one 4k monitor.  The manufacturer says it supports two 4k monitors with the included passive adapters, but that is wrong - it only supports one monitor at 4k resolution with the passive adapters (all other output will go out at 1080p).You must buy four active adapters if you want all your 4k monitors to have good quality with no lines cutting across your screen.  I tried using one passive adapter with three active adapters and the 4k screen on the passive adapter had very poor quality with lines cutting across the middle.When I use four active adapters, the card works flawlessly.  The image quality is beautiful.']"

Needed to add more monitors but lack of slot space, so got this.  Worked great on Windows, but ran into some issues on Linux Kubuntu.  The free drivers crashed when trying to run the board which seems a bit strange when this chip set dates back to 2015.  I loaded the NVidia drivers and it worked fine, but don't connect anything to it when you bring it up before loading the drivers or you get no video. Kind of hate to have to use non open source drivers, but wanted it to work as it fit nice in available space.  It also runs about 12 deg C cooler than the other board."", 'Works', 'I am using Windows 10 x64.  I removed an older NVidia-based card from my computer because it would not drive two 4K monitors, but I already had NVidia GeForce Experience installed with the latest drivers for the old card.  I thought this would give me a head start with a new NVidia-based card but it turned out not to be the case.The new Quadro card  comes assembled for half-height installation.  The part is included in the box for full-height installation in the computer (which I had to use).  After installation, I connected one 4K monitor and tried to bring the computer up without installing the new drivers yet (per the instructions).  After two self-reboots and several anxious minutes of black screen, the machine finally came up in safe mode (in ancient, VGA resolution), allowing me to install the drivers from the included disk.  Driver installation went quickly and smoothly, and I had a 4K desktop pretty quickly.  After a reboot, I downloaded an updated graphics driver (there was one available from NVidia) and then connected the second 4K monitor.  Just like that, I had two 4K monitors working perfectly.The card uses space-saving mini-display port connectors, and it comes with 4 mini DP-to-DP adaptors which I did not use.  Instead I bought a couple of 2M (6.6ft) cables that had mini DP on one end and DP on the other.  These worked fine, but then I decided that I really wanted to put my computer in a spot that demanded these cables\' length would have to be more like 4M (13.2ft).  There is all sorts of scary information out there about max lengths of DP cables;  in fact the longest passive one you can buy is apparently 3M (9.8ft) which would have been too short.  I swallowed hard and order a pair of ""Amazon Basic"" 2M (6.6ft) Display Port extension cables.  I was delighted to find that both 4K monitors came up with this extended cable arrangement just fine, and they continue to work well.Some information out there might lead one to believe that the quality of the 4K picture of a DP connection might be degraded with a 4M (13.2ft)  cable.  I could see no difference at all in either resolution or motion video performance.  I did ultimately find a source that explained that DP protocol either works 100% or it does not work at all, it\'s not a question of quality degradation due to missing bits here and there, it\'s a go-no-go situation.  Maybe adding another couple of feet would kill it, but at 4M (13.2ft) I\'m in business with dual 4K DP-based monitors and very happy.', 'Needed multiple monitors for a small form factor (SFF) Dell computer. This card did the trick. No problem running 3 monitors on Windows 11.', ""Received the package finally and opened it up to find a high profile bracket included in the box. Why can't Amazon and PNY clearly state this in the product description? For that I am giving this review a 3 stars simply because (Based on other users' reviews) I went ahead and bought the high profile bracket from Ebay costing me an additional $12 plus shipping. Now I have an extra bracket which I don't need.Another thing is that I am connecting the DP to my 4K Samsung TV but I am unable to get 4K resolution. Maximum recommended is 1080. I think it has to do with the hdmi cable but I am not sure. I am having the same issue with my GTX 970 GPU as well so I am leaning towards the cable issue. Maybe I am using a Ver. 1.0 HDMI cable. I will ask the same question in the Q&A section."", ""This card is a good option for SFF workstations or for those wanting a lower midrange professional card. There simply aren't decent single-slot half-height (low-profile) bracket graphics cards out right now, and this card has a lot going for it at a decent price point. It easily drives four displays, has a tiny power footprint, and is super quiet. It's definitely not a gaming card, but it can run most games fine if you're okay playing at 1080p and medium graphics settings (it's roughly a GeForce GTX 750, with significantly more memory). In the Quadro lineup, it's a huge upgrade over the K620. Comparing to some of NVIDIAs other professional offerings, it's also a huge upgrade in performance (at a lower price point) compared to the aging NVS 510.Inside the box, apart from the card itself, you get four mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort adapters, a full-height mounting bracket, and an incredibly outdated driver CD (just download the latest drivers from NVIDIA's website) . Some other reviewers apparently didn't get the full-height bracket with their unit; I'm not sure what the cause of this discrepancy is. If, for whatever reason, you need additional brackets for this card, it uses the same brackets as the NVS 510, which are both easy to find and inexpensive.Is this card for everyone? Definitely not. But it's currently the most powerful half-height Quadro card, and is currently the only above-entry level SFF Quadro card. For general purpose use, while you do pay a premium for the Quadro branding, it's pretty much the best option right now for a SFF system where you can't compromise on either single-slot or half-height brackets."", 'Finally...... Took awhile but got everything working..Inserted this card into a HP 750-247c Envy PC. Had initial problems seating the card into the PCI-e slot. Had to reseat card.

However, last year I bought a retina macbook pro and saw how crisp that screen looked, and after working on that laptop and then moving over to my desktop for work, those screens looked terrible. So, naturally, I upgraded to two UHD 27” screens. However, my NVIDIA 750 TI could not drive those screens at the same time. I never play video games, so I decided a workstation card was the way to go. This card handles my new screens beautifully. I run linux on my machine, so I can’t really say how it works on windows, but I am sure it will work just as well, if not, better. Also, I mostly just write code, and love the high resolution simply for the screen real-estate and sharp image, so I haven't tested this card with any kind of graphical or CAD engineering software to see how it performs in that arena. I did, however, download some 4K videos to see if there was any screen tearing during video playback (which is a problem I had with my NVIDIA 750 TI), and there wasn't. For me, this card was an awesome upgrade for my machine, and I love my dual screen set up. I also love the low-profile form factor, and the low power draw of this card."", 'Linux Ubuntu 4 monitor trading station everything worked right of the box, very happy with setup.', 'I needed a low profile video card for a low profile Dell workstation, so we could open and edit some CAD files.

The K600 video card is an Autodesk recommended card for each Revit version. I think, it is apply only if you have one version installed on your system.

(I use the Dell Precision T3610 model) The Revit 2013 problem is solved and I do not have any problem with Revit 2013 and other Revit version. I think Autodesk recommendation is partially valid, newer Revit version and multiple version installed on same system should suggest better video card with newer processor and more memory on board than K600.The new K2200 works perfect, easy to install.

I picked up one of these riser kits, stuck it in the 1x PCIE slot on the motherboard, ran the cables, mounted it and my PCI card in a cheap electronics project enclosure that I happened to have laying around, popped out some holes for the cables to run with a dremel, and it works like charm.It does come with the cable that runs from the PCIe slot to the riser card. It also comes with screws and offsets if your PC case happens to have room to mount it in there. There are different options for mounting holes in the riser PCB, and it also ships with metal rails and yet more mounting options around the edges that can be removed if necessary.My motherboard is ATX size, and the ATX case I stuck it in only has 7 card/slot spaces, so this would not fit inside my case. If you happen to have extended ATX or something bigger, or a smaller motherboard in an ATX case, it might just mount right in for you.An alternate position in the chassis wasn't an option for me without seriously modding the computer case or spending extra time and money making pig tail cables since I needed to get a massive 25pin cable header in there somehow. No problem, rather than investing in extra ribbon cables, brackets, etc...I just extended an SATA power cable out of the computer case along with the included riser USB style cable.If you need to go external with it, be sure to extend an SATA power connection to the riser board somehow. If covering your PCI card(s) is important to you, pick up a proper sized pencil box or something that's rated to handle the temperatures your card(s) might emit and mount it in with your card(s), dremel out the holes/slots you need to get cables in.

FX 570 are good cards, but they are 6 years old, so I wanted to upgrade to something faster and also I want to have one card (not two), which will drive all 3 monitors.By having only one card I will save in power usage too.Because all nVidia cards prior to Kepler series were only capable to drive 2 monitors I was forced to go to K2000.K2000 is the cheapest Quadro card which can drive 3 monitors.You can ask: why nVidia, not AMD?I\'ve tried AMD. The cheapest AMD card which can drive 3 monitors is V4800.I\'ve bought it and also bought 2 Active DisplayPort to DualLink DVI adapters (Bizlink).On paper V4800 should be capable to drive 3 DVI monitors using active DisplayPort to DualLink DVI adapters, but I was not able to make it work. Two monitors were fine with AMD card, but I want 1 card, not two.I\'ve tried different drivers and different configuration (Spend several days trying to change drivers and switch monitors and cables and adapters). Sometimes after reboot it will drive 3 monitors, but after 10 min or so it will drop 3rd monitor without any reason and even reboot will not help.I don\'t know why AMD claimed they support 3 DVI motors, it was not working for me.May be it was my specific V4800 card, but I don\'t want to buy one more card and end up with the same result.After struggling with AMD, I\'ve decided to try nVidia, but because I want only 1 video card, my cheapest choice was K2000.I was preparing to fight with nVidia too, because of the bad experience with AMD.To my surprise nVidia K2000 worked without any issue at all.Just plug and play. So now I have one card which drives 3 DVI monitorsOne 2560x1600 monitor using DVI output directlyOne 2560x1600 monitor using DisplayPort through active DispalyPort to DVI output adapterOne 1600x1200 monitor using DisplayPort through Active DispalyPort to DVI output adapter.Also all  my 3 DualLink DVI cables are very long 50\' (cables are from monoprice (item 2185), because my  workstation is in the garage, but monitors are in the office.May be my long cables were a reason why 3 DVI monitors did not work with V4800, but 2 monitors were fine with long cables on V4800.By moving from two FX 570 cards to K2000 I\'ve saved about 40W of power consumption or about 20$ per year. (I\'m assuming I\'m using workstation for about 12 hours per day)April 30, 2014:After couple of days DualLink DVI monitor from DisplayPort disaapered in the same way as V4800.After some trouble shutting, and swapping DisplayPort to DVI adapter K2000 started working again, but after 3 hours it happens again, I\'ve just rebooted computer and now for 2 days it is working again in the highest resolution.So I\'ve decreased rating to two stars from 3 stars after disappearance of the third monitor.But the third monitor disappeared differently on nVidia then on AMD. If I will decrease resolution, it will continue working, but in AMD case nothing will resurrect monitor.May 29, 2014After using this card for a month, I\'ve added one star back (3 star card)One monitor 3007WFP disappeared (went blank scree) several times, but I found way to fix it:I put both my 3007WPF monitors on DisplayPorts, after doing that 3007WPF monitors will stop disappearing, even putting them back was easy, just changing resolution twice: to 1280x800 and back to 2560x1600.May be a reason for monitor disappearance is a combination of long cables 50\' and an old Dell monitor: 3007WFP.Because after adding Dell U3011 it will not disappear.Now I connected three 30"" dell monitors to this card.U3011 to DVI connector and two 3007WFP to Display ports.Display port connectors have active DisplayPort to DVI adapters and there are 50"" DVI cable to drive U3011 and two 3007WPF monitors.Before if one of the 3007WFP monitors were on DVI it will go blank after some time, but this problem is not happening with U3011.Probably signal was too week for 3007WFP, but fine for U3011.Jan 19, 2015For several months my setup with 3 x 30"" monitors is running fine.U3011 on Dual Link DVIand both 3007WFP on display ports with active DisplayPort to Duallink DVI converters.And all three monitors are on 50\' dual link dvi cable from Monoprice.Occasionally once in 2 months on wake up from a sleep mode one 3007WFP monitor will show double pictures, but changing resolution to 1280 x 800 and back to 2560 x 1600 will fix this issue.', 'Quick Pros: It works great; easy install; GREAT support (John).Quick Cons: First two cards were defective; almost gave up on them.At Christmas I built my wife a new computer with a lot of power and this specialized card she needs for 3D graphics work. I spent a lot of time researching the cards that were compatible with the software, and then cross-referencing them with the prospective motherboards to be as certain as possible that the build would go off without a hitch.The 1st K2000 was DOA. Computer wouldn\'t even boot with it installed.A week later, with the replacement card installed, the video was crummy and I couldn\'t install the drivers. I sent that card back for a refund, hesitant to order a third.A couple of days later I called PNY mainly to see if there was a known problem with a recent batch. John, possibly the best tech support guy I have ever spoken with, said there was not and listened carefully to the problems I had. He felt that he probably could have helped me through the aborted driver install on the second card, and promised that if I purchased a third card he would be available to assist me if needed. He also gave me some hints.The conversation with John restored my confidence in PNY so I ordered another card. It arrived Monday and the driver installed with ease.So, the PNY was not without it\'s trials and tribulations, but I find that\'s pretty well normal with electronics. Last build I had to send memory sticks back and forth for a while. As Roseanne Rosanna Danna used to say, ""It\'s always something.""The two important things to take from this are: 1) Buy from Amazon and send it back if it\'s defective; 2) PNY support was outstanding and that\'s really, really important.', ""I built a high-end graphics workstation for my daughter who is a senior in college majoring in graphics arts.  After months of research, weighing price and features of NVIDIA vs.the competition, I decided to go NVIDIA.  I run a team that provides modeling and simulation services to the government.  All our machines use NVIDIA Quadro cards.  All my technicians swear by them. I consulted other professionals and they universally recommended the Quadro series for workstation applications, mostly because of the drivers.  That is the big difference with NVIDIA Quadros, their drivers.  I then had to decide how much pain to endure in terms of price.  I was afraid the 600-series cards would not be powerful enough for life after college and the 4,000 series prices are just cost prohibitive for me personally.  As it is, this card was the single most expensive part of the build.  Having said all that, I could not be more pleased.  The performance on the Autodesk software my daughter uses is outstanding. No hesitation even with her most demanding 3D animation products.  I didn't know much about drivers, but there are more to the Quadro drivers than just making the card work.  The features and flexibility you get are unmatched in anything you would experience on your average PC.  The ability to create multiple virtual desktops for your different process applications is very useful.  My daughter can now have a series of applications open and diaplayed on her dual-monitor rig with a set of views for animation, another for photo editing, another for writing, all by loading the desired profile. All the apps load and the displays pop up in the precise location she wants them, all by selecting a saved profile. Buying this card was a good decision and research pays off.  Building a workstation for professional use is much different than building a system for home use or gaming.  Lastlyy, I had no issues whatsoever installing the card or installing the software/drivers.  It worked perfectly the first time I pushed the power button."", 'This card replaced a GeForce 6200 LE.  After 22 years of use, I was overdue for a replacement.  The Quadro supports DisplayPort MST at minimal cost, along with not needing to upgrade my power supply, or worry about my house burning down if I used said expensive card.', ""I became annoyed that my old NVIDIA card was failing to recognize a second monitor (which had worked before and does fine on other computers).  So I chose this one for price, horsepower, power consumption, and the fact it would work in my system that is older and a bit tight inside.  I got it to work and the second monitor came up just fine - the first time!  Now, every time I restart, turn on the monitor, or during some resuming from sleep, the second monitor won't be recognized.  This happens with another known good monitor too.  I see people complain about this on NVIDIA forums and they say to shut off the monitor, then unplug the video cable, then to wait a while and plug it back in, and finally turn on the monitor.  That sort of works for me but is not a reliable solution and it's a hassle.  Can NVIDIA get this right?I suppose my biggest complaint, however, is that performance has hardly changed.  Screen refreshes are not as snappy as other older NVIDIA cards and hardware acceleration is barely any faster with this card than my old one."", 'The elusive Quadro card at 4X the price of an Nvidea GTX gaming card was a tough call.  Yes my GTX 650 TI card seems to have the same or better dynamic frame rate that the Quadro.  Where is the value?  Half of it is in the software drivers, optimized for very razor crisp CAD lines.  Some CAD software also turns on a few extra reflections in the material shading.  This card only consumes about 55W so you do not need to upgrade to a high power gaming PSU, and yet somehow it can run 4 monitors--wow.  A very stable card.', ""I use this card for Autodesk Maya.  I finally upgraded from my old Quadro 600 that worked good, but was looking for more performance.  This card delivers.  It's definitely pricier than consumer cards, but works well when you use 3D design programs or even Photoshop.  I don't own a Quadro 4000, but looking at the specs, the K2000 is similar with more CUDA cores at half the price (win-win).So far the only down side is early driver issues.  30 bit color no longer works in Maya, and the Force 10-bit mode in the driver causes both Photoshop and Maya to crash.  That's very disappointing, since that's why I wanted a card with two displayport outputs to drive my 30 bit enabled primary monitor and displayport only second monitor.However, like I've seen with the 600, drivers are updated frequently by NVidia, so I'm confident they'll get support up and running especially with their certified drivers.Unless you need the extra performance or two displayport outputs, the K600 can be had at less than half the cost and still has good performance, making it a better value in my opinion."", 'I bought this video card for 3D production (modeling and sculpting) and although there are better options available this is a great video card for someone on a budget looking to do modeling .

It would not be recognized by my system. I bought this because it's the recommended card type for design applications. Although reviews were few and mixed, Newegg had a very impresssive video with an Nvidea representative. I have since bought an MSI GTX 760 gaming card which was also stated via reviews to work for design as well as gaming. NOTE, I have an MSI Z87 G45 gaming card and decided to use the same brand GPU. It has crossed my mind that maybe it was simply incompatible with the motherboard, but since the new card went in, so far screaming fast, crystal clear performance make me think not...

I finally looked this code up -- 5 in this case -- and it signaled some sort of trouble with the motherboard. I had installed some new RAM in the computer about six months ago and thought maybe it was defective. Ultimately, this led me to remove and reseat the RAM in my computer worked just fine. Before I bought this card I was unable to run DaVinci Resolve with my old 512k card.  Now it works fine.  Also, videos that used to hang up set to HD now run smoothly and clearly.I didn\'t bother replying because I expected to follow up.  Not only did they follow up, THEY CALLED ME ON THE PHONE!

I do video conferencing, document editing, some Visio, web browsing etc.', ""I have 3 screens connected to my PC, one of which is a large-screen TV. My old setup was having trouble with the big screen even though it was supposed to be supported. The picture would break up regularly. Then I replaced one screen with a newer DP model. There wasn't room for the massive video cards on offer these days, nor the desire for all the cooling noise they create.The NVS 510 was a great solution - compact and quiet, but supporting 4 high end screens. It does use mini-DP ports to fit a single slot but includes 4 adapters with clips to easily attach screens. I found and ordered one HDMI adapter from NewEgg for the TV connection. It might be cheaper to use an adapter cable. Now the TV signal is stable, the new screen is supported, and the unit runs cool.For some reason, Windows didn't order the screens in the sequence of connection but I was able to correct the issue in the NVIDIA control panel (downloading the latest version from their web site)."", 'Allowed me to hook up 3 totally different monitors with ZERO headaches. Two in landscape and one in Portrait. 27"" 16:10 , 24"" 16:10 and a 22"" 16:9, one with VGA, one with DVI and one Display Port. All mixed match and they all look great and worked with no probs. Hooked up to a SFF PC, HP Elite 800 . I didn\'t use the included adapters. I bought cable matters cables to match my monitors and with mini Display port connectors on the other end.  I\'m not a big nVidia fan but this thing just works.  You want 3-4 monitors, just spend the money, get this thing and be done .', ""This is a great device for the cost.  Comes with  everything noted, including four solid miniDP to DP converters.  Card came in sealed bag, shipped with a DVD with drivers on it as well.  I'm actively driving four 2K monitors, and its doing so effortlessly.Hardware wise this card has a GPU, but it's not one really designed for games.  It's got enough power to do most basic things while driving four displays.  That includes things like video encoding, decoding, and some 3D boosts.  To be super clear this is NOT DESIGNED FOR GAMING, but for business use.  And it does exceptionally well at doing that with most apps one would use for business (CAD software, editing, etc).The only minor disappointment was that the GPU driver is apparently not versioned correctly (or possibly not strong enough?) to support enhancing zoom conferencing with virtual backgrounds.  It may be that the hardware could support it, but Zoom doesn't see the version info it wants and simply refuses to try.  Hopefully that will be corrected if it can at some point in the future."", ""This review is from a customer who has purchased and installed about 10 of these now for our business.This card works fine as long as you do not touch it.  The Mini Displayports on this card are either faulty, or Mini-Displayport technology itself is faulty.  After about 4-6 months of usage, the video's begin to not work and go black.  The problem is, if you slightly touch or bump the connection, it loses visual.  We then spend time trying to resolve it, rebooting, re-plugging up everything.  Eventually you can get your display back.. until you bump it again.For the average home user, probably not an issue.  For businesses who need 4-8 screens working 24/7 on critical computers, this is not a good product.  Getting called at 2 am to come troubleshoot Faulty Graphic cards sucks.  I Have reached out to PNY for RMA, and they have been helpful in working with me to resolve it.  However, at this point, we do not want replacement cards.  We would rather have our money back and go buy Quad cards that have Displayport or HDMI inputs.  If we want to stay in the nVidia world and stay under $500 per card, that means rolling back nearly a decade to the NVS 450. Because this NVS 510 was the only Nvidia Card that had Quad capability on a low profile bracket.This results in us looking back to ATI and their Cards for options.  I sincerely hope and wish nVidia/PNY is able to craft working technology for Quad monitor users who do not want to troubleshoot this issue any further."", ""I love this thing.  So far the only issue I've had is that it isn't a gaming video card.  I can play games in standard definition, like WoW and such, but anything more than that and this won't really give me the quality I want.  But, I got it to power my 4 DP monitors and it does beautifully.  I wish it did have more memory since I believe it is the issues I can't play WoW in low resolution, watch Netflicks, and maybe short You-Tube videos from time to time.  The video sync gets a second or two off, and/or stops and then runs real fast to catch up.  My PC is normal for current times, 16GBs ram, i7 Proc, ETC.  It is a Dell Optiplex so that could be it, but just playing a couple of video streams and some minor gaming shouldn't cause that much stuttering I wouldn't think."", 'The car arrived with a CD containing the network drivers. They were incompatible with Windows 10 OS Build 19041.1052. Had to download third party drivers which I was not happy about.  The card is working. Just would have been nice to have the correct drivers.', ""This card did not work in my HP Envy, which has the requited PCIE x16 slot, 32Gb, Win10, etc.This is the second attempt to get a PNY NVS 510 video card working in this system.The first card arrived without an installation CD, though the one sheet of paper it did come with indicated that it was to be in the package. I installed the card but never got a response from either video monitor (LG G-Sync). I did try installing drivers downloaded from NVIDIA but they failed because the hardware cound not be found.I returned the card and got a replacement.The replacement came with an installation CD but there was no documentation, only drivers. The one sheet of instructions indicated that the installation guide was on the CD. It was not, and not in the unzipped contents of the driver as well. Undaunted, I installed this second card and the result was the same, no display. Actually the monitor said no signal and went to sleep.Additionally, installing this card into an HP Envy is a nightmare. I bent a couple of grounding fingers, attached to the case, because of the card's output panel small size.I'm returning this card also.I do not expect to buy a PNY card in the near future nor can I recommend one to anyone who has an HP Envy.""]"

I can interact with multi-million polygon scenes at decent framerates for the first time, and don't need to spend nearly as much time hiding and unhiding objects to be able to get my work done.The only negative I've experienced so far is a substantial delay when unhiding or cloning objects.

Another important consideration is where a single workstation or multiple workstations must be employed to produce frame by frame content, containing HD and Deep Color or 4K Color media content, which requires substantial continuous energy resources to complete tasks.Technical Support for issues not related to the function of the card itself but rather interoperability issues has been remarkable.', 'For the money a decent card for the novices builder not a good purchase utility software and drivers not the greatest and you need to know a bit to setup to function at peak performance.', ""It could be my system, but occasionally this card won't see one of my four monitors (displayport) and I'll have to manually add it after startup.

It has a video card that is integrated into the mother board and shares processor time. I was using 1 monitor through a VGA connection. I\'m not much of a gamer, but I do like to play Minecraft. I was having all kinds of problems with my frames-per-second. Hoping to get more speed out of my computer, I swapped out my hard drive with a very fast solid state drive and re-installed my system. Minecraft on Windows 7 was even slower on this computer, so I installed Windows XP as a dual boot system. That was a little better. However, I had to ratchet down many settings in the game. I turned the clouds off, changed the render distance to about 6 blocks, turned off all the fancy graphics and visual effects. Even with everything turned way down or off, the fasted FPS I could get was 16. If there were any mobs or other players nearby, my FPS would drop to 3 or 4. I couldn\'t even play when something was attacking me.I bought this video card in hopes that it would make things a little faster. I immediately saw a difference. I was now able to connect a second monitor... 1 through VGA and 1 through DVI. Having two monitors was great. When I played Minecraft, I really saw the difference. It was like playing a completely different game. My FPS jumped to over 100. I was able to turn the fancy graphics on. I turned on the clouds and increased my render distance. I was able to use resource packs with much more detailed graphics. Even with everything turned way up, I never dropped below 50 FPS... even with multiple monsters nearby and on a Windows 7 operating system. It was amazing. My block updates for Minecraft were also significantly faster. I\'m guessing the computer processor and memory were now free to do more processing instead of video rendering.  I was thinking of buying a new computer. This single graphics card changed everything and I feel like I have a new computer.The only problems I had were related to my system. For Windows XP, the graphics card drivers require service pack 3. I did not have that, so I could not use the card with my much older system. Since I have a dual boot system, I just shifted to my main Windows 7 system with no problems. I plan to remove my Windows XP system since I was only using it for Minecraft anyway.The second problem I had was related to the computer audio. Since this new card has an HDMI output and HD audio as part of the HDMI output, my regular earphones stopped working. I was able to quickly find a few web posts from people with the same problem. I opened my computer bios at system startup and found the default audio settings. I changed the audio setting to be ""onboard"" by default instead of ""automatic"". With that quick change, my sound was back. I haven\'t used the HDMI features of the video card yet, so I do not know if I need to change the bios again for HDMI output.I\'m not sure if other video cards would have had the same results, but I\'m very glad I bought this one.', ""My computer: Dell Inspiron 620; 8GB of RAM; Intel Core i5 2320 @ 3GHzThe card was easy to install. It does not require a connection to the power supply and just fits into the PCI E X 16 Slot. After that it took around 30 minutes to acquire and update all of the drivers needed to function properly.My FPS (frames per second) for my computer’s stock graphics card was rated at 7 FPS. When I installed this graphics card it went up to 22 FPS. That is not the upgrade I was expecting with a brand new graphics card, and wasn’t enough for me to keep the card. I have returned it for a refund. For a brand new graphics card I was expecting a massive jump in FPS, and this didn't give it to me.On Blacklight Retribution (free to play first person shooter) the gameplay quality was very choppy. When I would turn my character in any direction the screen would struggle to shift from left and right and would distort during a turn. The low quality settings could have remedied this, but I didn’t buy a new graphics card just to play on low settings.I did not see an overall upgrade in the video quality of any videos, be it 1080p YouTube videos or the videos I have saved to my hard drive. I wouldn’t recommend this card if you just want a simple video upgrade."", ""I bought this for an HP Pavilion  P7-1439 which has a MSI MS-7778 (Jasmine) Motherboard.  The power supply is kind of feeble and this card doesn't require it's own power.I run dual monitors, one VGA one DVI, and this works fine.The card and the motherboard don't play nicely together though.  First, I had to fiddle with the bios to get it to recognize the card - you have to enable legacy support, and turn off security.  To get to the bios, you press F10 when the HP logo appears, but once you've installed the card, the HP logo never appears.The software  crashes on installation, even when downloading the latest one. It crashes after the drivers have been installed, but before the config software has been installed. So the drivers work, with no configuration software.Well, the drivers work most of the time. If crashes occasionally - an error box appears, with nothing in it, and I press Alt-F4 to get rid of it, that means that games won't work until I reboot.They have a helpline, but it's only open until 8pm eastern time, which is useless if you live on the west coast and have a job.However, when it works, it seems to work pretty well. I can play World of Tanks on medium-high settings at around 30 FPS."", 'The card is solid for playing games but obviously not as good as a $500+ card.  I have no complaints on resolution for the games I play (GTA IV, Crysis 2 and 3 and the like).  I have it connected to my monitor using the DVI output.  The Nvidea game-optimization software seems a little over the top, offering to align your game settings to the card\'s performance profile but it is not intrusive and if it helps a little then it\'s not a big deal.The only trouble I had was setting up a second display.  I also want to play recorded media through Windows Media Center on a 53"" HDTV.  When I connected to the TV through HDMI the card had some trouble and the screen froze.  I had to restart a couple times and the (up-to-date) Nvidea Control Panel software could not get the display set to the TV\'s native resolution.  Windows Media Center\'s display setup finally got it set right.  I haven\'t tested the HDMI connection much since geting it set up but it was stable and seemed to work as it should.  Because the setup pain was temporary and it works it still gets 5 stars.In all it is a good purchase and I am happy with the price/performance ratio.', 'This wasn\'t exactly what I wanted to use but it got here first so I installed it anyway.I\'m giving this five stars because I\'m rating the video card (and perhaps the packagingand the installation) and not the buying experience. The product was cheap enough andit shipped pretty fast regardless, so no problems there.First there isn\'t going to be enough beef in this to get insane frame rates from complexgames at high resolutions. I have it pumping out to two 24"" flatscreens and I\'m gettinga bit of ghosting (tearing?) from highly compressed videos. I didn\'t expect that, since I\'venever seen that problem before, I was kind of suprised by it. The problem could be drivers,the player I\'m using, the monitor, or the video card. I don\'t know and I don\'t care, it\'s notenough of a bother for me to even look for updated drivers.The ""experience"" application from the chip manufacturer isn\'t anything I want or use, all itdoes is download drivers and initialize the setup routine (woo).Otherwise the imagery and color representation from this video card is nothing short of stunning.With newer drivers I wouldn\'t be surprised if this turns out to be a capable game video card as well,but I can\'t vouch for that.', ""My OEM GT610 tanked. PC is 4+ years old, shelling out several c-notes wasn't an option. Very pleased with this choice.Plugs into a single slot, but the cooling shroud eats up an adjacent slot. Not a problem for me, but if you're down to your last slot it won't fit. Installation was a snap. No problems with Windows 7x64 and the latest drivers.Fan is very quiet at 40% or less. Ramps up with GPU load, but remains tolerable up to 70% or so.  In average continuous use, temp rarely goes above 45 degrees(C). Using FurMark, burned it for 1 hour - topped out at 68 degrees. Played a finnicky BD right after, no problems. Plenty of headroom for HD/DVD/BD, and anything the web can throw at it. My WEI rating increased from 5.0 to 5.9. Flash videos don't hang or crash anymore, HDMI sync & resolution is fine on a 32-inch LCD. Huge step up from the GT610. Big bang, small bucks.Of course this isn't the choice for serious gamers, but they already know that (wouldn't ya think?). For folks with a fairly recent PC and sub-par graphics, this is a winner. Decent price, decent performance, great deal."", ""I thought the card would be as good as my old 8800 GTS but I have to run it in 1600x900 on auto detect. In town, LA, I get maybe 30 FPS. Outside, by myself, I can get 50. If I run boss battles it will drop to 12-15. The strange thing is I tried 1366x768 & got a LONG freeze as well as several short freezes by myself & in boss battles. The freezes didn't require a hard reboot though. The HDMI, DVI, & VGA hookups on the back are off set high on the bracket so the HDMI cable won't seat al the way in. Hasn't affected operation just my OCD acting up. NVIDIA surround is OK not sure if it's as good as my old sound blaster, took it out, there was only a digital I/O. I used a 8mm to RCA y cable. The last thing I have to say is it didn't recognize my ONKYO HTS-3300, it says I have a HT-R380, and has reversed my surround speakers, left is right and right is left. I really couldn't buy a fancy card because my Intel core 2 quad 2.4 ghz cpu may be bottlenecking the game."", ""While today's high-end gaming and video programs work best with state-of-the-art graphics cards, there's room for a good quality product that satisfies the needs of far more computer users. PNY has produced a satisfying version of nVidia's GeForce 630 GPU. There is ample speed and resolution for typical  viewing of videos, helped considerably by the 2GB of.attached DD3 memory. It calls for two-slot availability (due to the width caused by the whisper-quiet fan) but only one PCIe 20 x 16 slot is actually used. Three connecting ports are provided---the ones commonly in use today: full-size HDMI, DVI, and VGA. It supports Blu-Ray, Dolby Sound, and fully carries digital sound with the HDMI connection. All in all, for its modest price (in comparison to high-end cards), this product from PNY offers welcome improvement over what's usually provided by a computer's onboard graphics setup."", 'Rather than purchasing a new computer I decided to update my perfectly good eight year old Dell Dimension 9100.  After replacing XP with WIN 7, increasing the RAM to 4 gig, and adding a new wide screen monitor, the video card was my last improvement.  I was limited to a lower performance card because of power supply limitations.  The installation was smooth.  Windows immediately recognized the card and updated the drivers.  After installing the NVIDIA software and rebooting I was good to go.  I have not experienced any fan noises that others mention.  Streaming movies, sports, YouTube, and other videos improved significantly.  I am well pleased with the graphics card and the all the other improvements.', ""I have a Dell XPS 8300 desktop (about 2 years old) that came with a weak graphics card.

I'm able to turn up all of the graphics settings on SimCity to their maximum and I don't notice much if any slowdown.  It's great. This card exceeded my expectations.  What pointed me to this card was the Dell website.  It's a recommended upgrade for my PC.  I was looking at faster, more expensive cards, but my concern was if my PSU can handle those cards.

Works ok, but I usually have it at 1600x900 resolution on my 1080p TV and it leaves a black border around the screen, connecting at 1920x1080 instead of 1600x900 (when using 1920x1080 it fills the screen). My old card had Nvidia chips and every resolution used the full screen. The borders are not very wide so I can live with it. Using 1280x720 fills the screen, but I don\'t use smaller resolutions any more (5 years ago some of my old games used them, but I don\'t play those any more). Also, my ""Show Desktop"" button no longer clears all icons from the screen, but I seldom used it.  Installation: had to use Windows 10 Update to get drivers for it, AMD no longer have drivers for the old chips on the card.  Overall: works well enough I\'m not going to bother exchanging it for one with Nvidia chips.  Later: When I changed the colour depth from 10 bits to 8 bits, at 1600x900 resolution it covers the full screen. All my videos are 8 bit, so I\'m going to leave it this way.', 'I did not follow the recommendations of the manual which was to use only with windows.

The support department was quick with their response to utilize a manual for a different model (4350). Additionally the driver supplied with unit did not work on my system. Their online support was able to scan my system and download a compatible driver that so far has worked seamlessly. Quality of my display is vastly improved from before.', ""As stated in the title.

I used a DVI to HDMI connector (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TBLWFQX) for the HDMI port. Windows 10 had no issues recognizing the two monitors.

I am now buying local used cards for less.', ""My goal was to get an inexpensive HDMI out for an old Windows 10 PC to be a media PC and stream to an old large screen television. The Diamond Multimedia AMD Radeon HD 5450 PCI Express card seemed like a reasonable choice based on prior reviews. I wanted to write this review, because my experience was worse, and I wanted to share that for other potential buyers.The PCI video card you get, is not the same as in the manual. The manual mentions needing a separate power source and shows a card that looks like it has proprietary ports for a power cord - indicating that was not sufficiently powered by the PCI slot. These video card power ports described in the manual were not the same shape as an internal hard drive power cord, and there were not power ports on my actual PCI video card that came from Amazon.I called Amazon's tech support for the first time, and they said they had no specific solution. I ended up trying it anyway, and it was powered by the PCI slot alone. So I connected the computer,  booted to Windows 10, inserted the CD with their drivers -- only to find that their CD has no Windows 10 driver.  it did have older Windows drivers. Through a video link on the CD, I found YouTube video instructions referring to other sites to download drivers. I ended up getting it to 3/4 work, and I will probably keep it, but it was painful.The video resolution is good, but does not seem optimal. I don't feel like uninstalling it and comparing it with my previous on board video, so I am willing to keep it as is.It continually nags you to install game software, which I have no interest in doing for a media streaming device. Another annoyance is that if the local PC speakers are plugged in using the PC's 3.5mm mini audio cable (male-to-male green audio cable), the card will not transmit audio to the HDMI cable and the TV. This means that one has to plug and unplug the audio cable for local use versus streaming.It seems like a vendor got a batch of old cards that are still new in the box, and maybe they had wrong instructions and got discounted. For whatever reason, they ended up on Amazon."", ""Got this one to resurrect an old Ryzen system that used to have a heavy Radeon for gaming, but now I want to repurpose this system as a modest software development system.  So far so good, this graphics card work fine, drivers in Linux are very mature, in Windows 10 they use very old legacy Catalyst drivers, but hey, they work.However... It is 2023 and this is a early 2010s graphics card, as a matter of fact, I had the same model back then for a Phenom II X6 build server that we had at work!! Why AMD/Nvidia don't create a very simple fanless and current card for these kind of systems?  I guess now that the AM5 systems and most Intel CPUs do include integrated graphics isn't necessary, but it would have been a nice option for these kind of almost headless computers."", ""Works excellent for my web server. Just needed an added display port to service the equipment locally. It does it's job. Wouldn't recommend if your gaming or looking to play video in 4k. It just doesn't have the memory to handle it well if at all. Definitely not for mining! Good price for it's intended purpose though"", 'I bought a computer with only one video port. It needed a second video card  so this one was purchased. The physical installation was  pretty straightforward.  The instructions  for getting the  computer to  recognize this device relied essentially on intuition and a bit of dumb luck. The user is directed to a website to download  some file  which is  supposed to make  this card work. The installation has no indication that it is working or not.

I had trouble installing the Catalyst driver for XP. The driver would not install because Win XP stated that the drivers could not be verified and/or was unsigned. I started snooping around the AMD Catalyst folder and found the driver folder. I deleted the standard adapter in the Device Manager. Then I refreshed the Device Manager, forcing XP search for a suitable driver. I browsed to the driver folder in the Catalyst folder. Finally, after trying to install the Catalyst too many times, manually installing the driver using DM fixed it.  For a ~$50 card, this was a great deal. Also happy that it is fanless.', 'I purchased this with the intent of using either the VGA or HDMI just for initial setup of a Server (Onboard VGA of Server was dead). Well assembling is very easy, installation of the main card is also easy, but the VGA Ribbon Break Out Cable will NOT work because it is about a half inch too short for either flipping it to the front or the back of the card for install. The card works fine but I had to use the VGA Ribbon Break Out Cable not installed to do the setup. No matter which way you bent the ribbon cable it was putting a strain on the cable. The VGA Ribbon Break Out Cable also started to show some wear on the cable as if it was going to cut if I kept forcing it.', 'It was as advertized and works very good.', ""Well, courtesy of online classes I needed to be able to use Zoom on one of my computers. My 10 year old desktop machine just couldn't do it, and my little Lenovo could just barely. So...upgrade time!To be honest, purchasing this board was something of an afterthought, since I figured bringing the desktop machine's RAM up to 4 Gb and installing a quad core processor should do the trick. But - having had good results with Diamond products in the past, and a modest price tag for the board, I opted to buy it and try it.Upside: the card worked on the first try, and does a fine job of accelerating Zoom sessions.Downside: the drivers from the AMD website installed with little drama, but there's a shortcut for settings that doesn't lead anywhere (Win 7). However, the Catalyst app allows the user to configure the board so I'm inclined to think the shortcut is just a leftover that was not removed prior to being assigned legacy status.In any case - suits my needs to a tee.

It replaced an ATI Radeon 5970 that consistently ran hot and had the fans in the chassis working overtime.

It provided a smaller footprint with its thin profile compared with the brick size of the 5970.The current applications supported are Digital Media and Web Development (e.g. Adobe Creative Suite, Photoshop, Premiere, Illustrator, Flash, etc.), In addition to productivity applications for research and report writing (Microsoft Office).  The FirePro V7900 has performed solidly, quietly, and cooler thus requiring less chassis fan operation.  The advantage here is the reduction of noise in the work environment as well as consistent performance at the PROFESSIONAL WORKSTATION LEVEL.  Professional workstation applications consist of 1.) digital content creation such as animation, game development, broadcast and cinematic visual effects, and digital publishing.  2.) Engineering applications include CAD/CAM/MCAD, AEC (architecture/engineering/construction), Medical Imaging and Life Sciences, Computerized Fluid Dynamics, Simulation, GIS and Mapping, oil and gas applications.For the applications this unit is designed for (see above), the performances are unmistakably superior, reliable and meets the category requirements of a professional graphics workstation card.  I am planning to add an additional 4 (24-inch) monitors and another V7900 for a total of 8 monitors simultaneously.

Thermal Paste purpose is to act like a go-between/sponge to DRAW the heat FROM the graphics card GPU and then the heat sink further pulls that heat from the thermal paste etc..)As the thermal paste gets older and drier out the card\'s temperature begins to creep up...etc etc.. The problem with this card is that you cant simply reapply fresh thermal paste like you can on other versions of this exact same card. You can get thermal paste for as little as $3.95 or so. There are videos on Youtube about applying putting on fresh thermal paste to cards in this product line, the GEForce 210 GPU Series. Because with other brands such as MSI etc, the heatsink is removable, and you can access the thermal paste and clean & replace it. With this version you can\'t.EDIT :: Inserting this paragraph [ HERE] to specifically point out that you can\'t remove the heatsink from this card simply by unscrewing it or otherwise. On other cards you can. This card does not have the heatsink attached with screws, instead it is factory-equipped with a type of non-extractable rods that insert like push pins thru standardly placed holes in the corner areas of the card but with Q-tip sized plastic buds that flair out once the forward end of the rod has been fully inserted. This is the case for all four of them. If you zoom in on the heatsink in the product image of this card (the big black boxy rectangular object with fins upright vertically) you will see in the corner area of the card the HEADS of what would be screws on other versions of this card. Instead, on this card, the heads are flat, you can\'t use a flathead or phillips or hexadecimal or Torx or any kind of screwdriver because there is nothing there, it\'s completely bare, totally smooth, from the factory assembly process. They never intend anyone to renew this card, extend lifespan with maintenance, as covered below. They expect you to use it, then discard, and either get another one over & over again, or get a different kind that you can service with maintenance. (Discussed next)So be aware of that when making your decision to get this specific version. There\'s a reason for this. This is a ""quiet"" card. There is not a fan that helps the heat sink on this card, like there is on the cards with removable heat sinks. On those cards, the fan can make a whirring or humming sound, degree of noticeability varying by individual system setup. Soo You have a tradeoff decision.. Do you want to be able to renew the card with maintenance in 4-5 years or so but in the meantime maybe have a little added system noise.. or have no noise, a silent yet comparably performing graphic card instead, but you have to trash it and get a new one in about 4-5 years ? That\'s what you are getting here.I\'m not trying to talk you out of this card or into into another one... They cost only about $4 - $5 difference anyway, which is of negligible consideration... They are different form factors > NOISE-FREE QUIET or RENEWABLE LIFESPAN.As mentioned earlier, it depends on what you value more... for my bang, I prefer the NOISE-FREE QUIET... It\'s only a $39 card and sometimes you can get these even further marked down... I\'m replacing mine after years, no complaints.', 'Hi there guys, my name is Martin(games developer) and I\'ll get straight to the point !Let me explain few things about this card, this is not a graphics card for amazing games performances or graphics. You can check with Nvidia about the Specs of this card, but based on personal experience if you are looking for something that would run all the high intensive graphics, this card is not for you. Do bare in mind about the price of this card :) and the fact that graphics cards are the most expensive piece of hardware in the whole PC setup so don\'t expect too much.However I bought this card for a different reason and I\'ll explain to you why this card is so great for the money spent. I love gaming and when I do, my first instinct is to always tweak the graphics settings and try to see if the frame rate of my games drop or if I see some lag spikes in my gameplay that would annoy me while I am playing the game. I recently purchased a great graphics card for gaming the ""GTX 780Ti"" and I know that not most people would be as crazy as me to go and spend £500 on a single piece of hardware. I personally did some research and convinced myself that it was worth it, truly there isn\'t a game that would stand a chance but still I wanted the best performance. Now this is the reason why I love my GT210 card.Being a games developer doesn\'t always involve me playing games but programming a lot too, so for that reason I have 2 monitors (every programmer would understand the importance of having 2 screens in front of them). Having my expensive card for gaming running 2-3 monitors isn\'t the best option, since each screen requires GPU usage in order to operate, often meaning that if you decide to play a game you\'ll find that the performance would go down.This is where the GT210 is the perfect card for you ! - if many can relate to that situation of course :) This card is tiny yet powerful, silent and most importantly POWER EFFICIENT. In my case the card can easily support one or more monitors (now don\'t get me wrong here, by supporting I mean that you as a user can watch movies, surf the net, open any non-gaming application (Photoshop, Skype etc) - my tests conclude that the card can support quite a few games(I personally played all the Blizzard Entertainment games on it as well as League of Legends and ) but nothing too graphics intensive(Batman: Arkham City or the new Call of Duty series and you shouldn\'t expect it to !). I would like to compare it to the Nvidia 9500 GT, when it comes to gaming but if you do decided to test it on games such as Batman: Arkham City or the Call of Duty franchise or even some of the Blizzard games like I previously explained - please don\'t expect incredible results.As a bottom line, if any of you guys need a card to support your extra monitor or two in order to leave your main graphics card to fully breath and crush the games you play - This is the card for you ! It\'s silent, space efficient and only requires a maximum of 30.5(W)atts as Power from your PSU. Highly recommend ! It\'s great for that purpose and amazingly cheap. Hope I helped with your choice.', ""I have purchased 3 of these exact cards so far for upgrading the computers at work for use with dual monitors.  They work great.  The first one I purchased over a year ago and to date, I have had zero issues out of it.  We have Lenovo Micro workstations, so it is nice that EVGA includes the low profile brackets with the card, so you don't have to purchase them.  Using a dedicated GPU takes some strain off the CPU also, so it helps with speeding up the computer a bit.  There are 3 outputs (1x VGA, 1x DVI-DL, and 1x HDMI), but only a combination of 2 can be used at a time.  The HDMI doesn't appear to have audio pass through, as there is no NVidia HD Audio in the sound devices menu, but there is a digital audio menu in the NVidia Control Panel.  I can't confirm that it has HDMI audio since I am using the VGA and DVI connections.  If I get a chance I will check it, and post back.  These cards are entry level cards, meaning they don't have a whole lot of power, so I would not expect to play a lot of Graphic Demanding games, like Skyrim, Crysis or Battlefield on it.  They work good for running dual monitors, though.  They are HDCP compliant and render videos in HD really well.  You can Overclock the card, if you install EVGA's OC software, but you won't get much more out of it, and with the decreased life from the overclock, I don't think the benefits are great enough to even attempt it.  All in all, if you need a decent video card for a general usage computer and don't want to spend a whole lot, than you can't go wrong with this one.  Just remember after installing it to go to EVGA's website and register the card, so you can get the warranty.  It will give you the open to purchase an extended warranty also, if you think that you need it.  There is a link to register on the CD when you install the drivers, that will take you straight there, you just need to create a profile."", ""My PC has very poor on board graphics so when the old second hand one a friend gave me failed I had to get a replacement. The O/S I use and love is ubuntu which has a multiple workspace option. Without a graphics card my old PC switches between screens very slowly indeed and won't even run medium definition movies smoothly. This card has solved all that and runs a second monitor perfectly as well. Saying that, it's not entirely smooth on fast action or higher definition movies but it depends what you want it for. (obviously not for gaming). The old card I was using before was clearly a better card while it lasted but this one really is a bargain.On a technical note it's cooled by a heat-sink, not a fan and it does get rather hot. Saying that the computer has hardly ever been turned off in the four months since I fitted it and it hasn't failed yet. Installation was a piece of cake. Plugged it in, turned it on and away we went. It comes with an extra bracket, which I didn't need personally, and a CD of installation software but I think it's only Windows users that have to worry about that malarkey, along with all the virus problems and costly software!!!If your using two standard monitor cables you will need an adapter for your second monitor attachment. This is definitely a great stop-gap until you can afford a better one.  Oh yeah, and it did arrive in 2 or 3 days."", 'I had bought an version of this in the past and was updating a system so that I could use two monitors over HDMI (yes I had to use one DVI to HDMI connector as it has one of each: VGA, HDMI, DVI) as I had a cable that was DVI to HDMI that started to cause the monitor to flicker....second time I have had this happen on two completely different systems with different brand cables...interesting to say the least. So I swapped cables (straight HDMI as the old card had an HDMI connector) and all was good, but in the process I wanted to take the other monitor off of VGA and go to HDMI.... so the search began.First off, this system is used for work--- nothing graphically intense or the like, just normal computing with the usual watching of music videos and other online content in the off hours. Beyond the system being interesting and having to turn on the on-board video in BIOS to make a screen work for a while for setup--- the EVGA setup was cake. The software recognized the card and after a few minutes and one reboot, all was good to go. Swapped over to some new thin and longer (yeah!!!) cables.. all was good.Overall performance is good and the video quality is also good. The big thing I wanted was the lack of a fan as that is what has taken out my past three video cards was fan failure. So in the end, nothing fancy and will not set any records by any means, but it worked for me.This was an ""Amazon Warehouse"" deal that I had never tried to deal with something from that department before... in this case, everything was in the box, it looked like someone looked at everything and the card bubble wrap had been opened and re-closed and the box had a cut in it....but other than that which is absolutely nothing, it was in absolute perfect shape. I would definitely think about buying a warehouse deal on something again for sure.', 'Was good enough for what I needed and price was cheap', ""I have an older Windows XP computer which really was too slow for anything except a fish tank screensaver that I love. I tried a real fish tank and realized the computer is much cheaper to maintain than the real tank, so what the heck. I recently came across another old Windows 7 computer, which is faster than the fish tank computer but still pretty obsolete. I decided to swap them out. The Win7 computer had only integrated video and, since it was fast enough for some internet surfing and Youtube videos, I wanted to upgrade the graphics. I opted for this EVGA GeForce 210 video card.It installed with no issues. I connected the monitor and started the system. The resolution was low, but Win7 found the new hardware (the video card) and installed generic drivers. After re-booting, I saw improvement and had many more resolution options available (the integrated only offered 2 resolution settings). After a short period of fiddling with settings, I had the system looking the way I wanted. But when the fish aquarium screensaver started, it looked horrible. The fish had rough edges, the video was choppy, the air bubble appeared as one continuous line instead of floating bubbles. That was a huge disappointment.However, I had the presence of mind to go to the EVGA site and download the latest driver for the graphics card (the card came with one, but I wanted the latest version). I had not installed the GeForce driver initially because Win7 detected the card and install the generic driver. I assumed it would work the same. But after installing the latest driver from EVGA, the screen video was popping! My fish tank screensaver looked better than ever. All the graphics were nice and crisp, movement was smooth, bubbles floated like they were real.In all, for the money, the ease of installation, and the compatibility with older machines, this graphic card is working out great. Just don't be lazy like I was. Install the proper drivers. It makes a big difference."", ""I just installed this card in a refurbished HP Compaq 8200 Elite Small Form Factor PC, so I can use three monitors for writing code. It works great, but I wasted some time on simple things, here are my notes in case these help others:1) Yes, the card works just fine in the HP 8200 SFF, even though this box has only a 240W power supply, and the card specifies a minimum 300W power supply. When I had problem #2, I thought maybe the problem was the power supply being too small, but that wasn't the issue.2) On first bootup after installing the card, the box automatically disables on-board video in the BIOS... this puzzled me as I was expecting to bootup with the card installed, still using the on-board video for monitors 1&2, install drivers for the GeForce, then attach monitor #3 to the GeForce. But monitors 1&2 were blank. I attached monitor #3 to the GeForce (DVI) but still got blank on all three monitors on bootup. Eventually I realized that monitor #3 was also attached (VGA) to another PC (turned off)... I didn't think it would matter, but monitor #3 would only display DVI output from the GeForce after I unplugged the VGA connection.3) Once I fixed problem #2, I booted to BIOS using monitor #3 (DVI to GeForce), discovered that the box had automatically disabled on-board video, changed the setting to enable on-board video, then rebooted and now I could see the monitors attached to on-board video (VGA and DisplayPort).4) Why not run all three monitors on the 210 (VGA + DisplayPort + DVI)? This is a small box and with the card installed using the small-form-factor back-plate, the VGA port is inaccessible, and the DisplayPort opening is too close to the edge of the case for my DisplayPort cable to plug in. So effectively it becomes a card to support monitor #3 on DVI. For the price, it works for me and I'm happy.-FC."", ""I'm looking for a low cost way to improve the gaming performance of a 6-year-old desktop PC. This product (\nEVGA GeForce 210 Passive 1024 MB DDR3 Graphic Card\n) is a very inexpensive entry-level card. The main reason I picked the 'Passive' version is that it relies on just the heatsink for cooling. This eliminates the noise and reliability problem associated with cooling fans. Unfortunately as I found out later, the heatsink design on this card is inadequate and it overheats too easily. Details at 11...[Initial Observations]- The card is low-profile and it comes with two low-profile brackets. This proves to be vital since my old computer (Acer Aspire A3910) cannot accept a full-size PCI card.- Initially the card does not recognize my Samsung B2330HD LCD monitor. The display can only be set to 1280x800 max from HDMI port, nothing from VGA port.- After running the driver disc, the card is able to recognize my monitor at 1920x1080 from the VGA port, but now there’s nothing from HDMI port. I still haven't figured out why it can't use both ports at the same time.[Graphic Benchmark]I ran the 3DMARK 'Cloud Gate' benchmark program on my old computer, both before and after the graphic card update. The gaming performance of my computer improved by 6x according to this benchmark.BEFORE: Overall score=209 (GPU=168, CPU=1544)AFTER: Overall score=1346 (GPU=1550, CPU=922)See my uploaded screenshots for details.[Power Consumption]I used the\xa0\nEUM-A1 Power Usage Meter\n\xa0to measure the input power of my computer:- Before the graphic card upgrade, my computer consumes ~50-55W when idle, ~70-75W when running 3DMARK.- After the upgrade, it consumes 60-75W when idle, close to 100W when running 3DMARK.Based on the above, I can estimate this graphic card consumes up to 30W of power. Note that according to the NVIDIA web site, the GeForce 210 consumes 30.5W max.[Heatsink Design]In order for a passive heatsink to work efficiently, its fins need to be wide and deep. But this card comes with short and shallow heatsink fins. Furthermore, no matter how big is the heat sink, you still need free-moving air to carry the heat away. Otherwise the boards will overheat eventually.In my situation, the card sits in the upper corner of my computer (which does not have a case fan). That explains why my card overheats after just ~10-20 minutes of playing\xa0\nXCOM: Enemy Unknown\n. When that happens, the screen goes dark and the computer freezes. I need to manually shutdown the computer, wait for the card to cool down and then restart.The only way I can prevent overheating is to leave the case open, and use a fan to blow air at the heatsink. But doing so defeats the whole purpose of buying a 'passive cooling' card.[Bottom Line]The EVGA GeForce 210 Passive card gives my old computer a big performance boost. However its thermal limitation is just unacceptable. I'm sending it back for a refund.For my next step, I will try the MSI GT 710 card (\nGT 710 2GD3H LP\n). The GT 710 uses less power than the 210 (19W vs. 30W), and the MSI card comes with a much larger heatsink. So I'm hopeful that it will do a better job.""]"

It’s efficient for cost, but that’s pretty much it. You can’t do screen recording because the card is just not efficient at all. The benchmark for this is brutally low compared to most others. The display randomly reboots - aka if you have nightlight enabled (like myself), then your screen turns off, when it turns back on it’ll be bright as heck with no night light. Lastly, the VGA and HDMI ports show two different colours. Maybe that’s normal, but I bought 2 of the same monitors (both brand new) that had both ports. The VGA is more vivid than the HDMI (more true black for example).All in all, I definitely regret this purchase and I’m kicking myself for not just paying a little bit more for a better quality one. If games, videos, any screen recording, picture quality or graphic consistency isn’t important to you, this will do fine. Otherwise, don’t buy this.Update 2:It seems this graphics card isn't capable of screen recording. Then again, I'm not 100% familiar with what a PC needs for this, but a quick google search says it's based on your graphics/video cards capabilities. Therefore, if you need screen recording, this MAY not be the item you want.Update:I have 2 brand new monitors I purchased in March (2020), and I have a dual display set up. My old graphics card wouldn't work with the new monitors, so I bought this. I also have issues with blue light so I always have night mode enabled on my computers at all times.For some reason, my computer randomly turns the night light off and I have to go back to the settings to turn it off then back on again (which doesn't take much time). I'm using an fully stock and fully updated Windows 10 Pro, so I'm not too confident that the software is causing this issue as it didn't happen with my old laptop/graphics card. However, I could be very wrong.That being said, I'm left to only believe it's just this graphics card that's causing the issues. Again, relatively small and easy to fix, just more of a nuisance is all.Otherwise, I still love this because it's super cheap and does mostly what I need it to do!Original:For starters, I really have nothing to complain about. This works perfect, but I’ll add my experience for others who may find it a deal breaker.Like the title says, there are instructions that come with this, however they’re more general instructions for this brand, not this specific product. It tells you to go to their website, but you actually need to go to Nvidia’a website to download the drivers. For me, I just googled “msi geforce 210” and I was good to go.As well, and maybe this is to be expected, but I have 2 new monitors that are the same brand/model. One is connected by HDMI, the other on VGA. The VGA monitor is a lot crisper, while the HDMI is more faded/has a greyish tint to it. Because I don’t know if this to be expected with two different ports, I’ll let you be the judge of what to make of this.Otherwise, super simple to install the hardware and the driver (after finding it on Google), and it worked perfectly the first time. It’s super cheap so you really can’t go wrong there, unless you’re a hardcore gamer who needs high end gear (but you wouldn’t be looking at this product if you were).All in all, I’d recommend this easily."", 'The computer I\'ve been doing most of my work on for years is still running W2K Advanced Server - which I would have upgraded years ago except that MS doesn\'t provide an upgrade path from the AS operating system to a desktop version.

This card came with the drivers I needed, I replaced the video card, and it\'s been working happily ever since.', ""First, I do not think the current price for this card is appropriate. I read some other reviews and had to roll my eyes that were complaining about the performance of this card. Stop buying things without researching them. Buying this and expecting to game, record your screen, etc in the current time is frankly ridiculous. This card was low end when it was new, and it's now 13 years old. $60 for a 13 year old card that pales in comparison to even modern integrated graphics is highway robbery. They must be selling overstock by now, I highly doubt they are still producing these, so there is no excuse, they are simply abusing the current GPU market. You will NOT be satisfied with the performance of this card for the cost, period. You could find a used AMD CPU with integrated graphics that would blow this out of the water for about the same money.That said, I bought this card a few years ago for ~$30 iirc, which I think is a more reasonable cost. The purpose was to provide a display output for a server computer that has a CPU with no integrated video. No gaming, steaming, productivity work, etc. It has provided a simple display output to navigate the OS when needed (VNC programs rely on a display output to pick up in order to provide the remote functionality), which is rare. It has worked just fine, and still does to be fair. However, the tiny fan on it has developed a very loud whine that is indicative of impending physical failure (I have been in IT for ~20 years). I would expect to get at least 5+ years out of a video card that is barely used. I have much higher end cards in my families computers that are regularly stressed with gaming and various applications that support GPU hardware acceleration, and none of them have any issues, the most extreme example being a 780Ti that is now 9 years old. This is my singular experience so I may have been unlucky, but I am disappointed with the lack of reliability.I now need to buy a replacement card, bc replacing the fan is not worth it. I came here to just get the same card because I am looking for the cheapest solution possible, but I will not be purchasing this card again simply because I cannot stomach the current price. It's sad, because it's difficult to find a simple display adapter on the cheap these days due to the GPU market, and these very low end cards aren't worth much to anyone that knows better, so it's hard to justify the cost for what you are getting out of it.""]"

Was looking for an exact replacement. This version was the closest I could find, is made by PNY, and is a close ""clone"" to the original made by Nvidia. However, the card received is not a production product. When my system boots up, I get a BIOS message stating ""Engineering Release - Not for Production Use"". However, the card seems to work just fine with my Windows 10 workstation.', ""I bought this card to use mainly with Maya and Mudbox. I had been using a Quadro FX 1700 (512 MB) and I expected better. And I got that, and more. Maya is much snappier working with scenes of 500,000 polygons (63 skinned, textured models). I built the scene using the FX 1700, but it took a noticeable amount of time to select a model or move the camera. With the Quadro 4000 (2 GB) everything moves smoothly. I am sure there are limits on how large a scene you can be manage even with this card, but I haven't tried to create something that breaks it.On my older Quadro card, I had to sacrifice some gaming performance to get decent performance on Maya 2011. Cards like the GT 9800 (and the 325M I have in my laptop) work, but you can tell the difference when you select components (particularly vertices or edges). On a Quadro, you get the selection faster and more accurately, especially when working in the perspective view. On consumer cards, sometimes the wrong thing gets selected, and often there is a defined lag between when you click and when the selection is highlighted.However, on the Quadro 4000, I get great gaming performance, for example running Left 4 Dead 2 at 1920x1080 with high detail with a good frame rate rather than having to reduce the resolution at run lesser detail that I had to do with the old card. I could run games full bore with the GT 9800, but I had performance issues with Maya (even Maya 2009).I am well pleased with the card. My PC had only a 350 Watt supply, this card works well with that, so I didn't have to swap out to a larger power supply. I don't have but a single hard disk in this machine (lots of network storage), so I expect that helps on the power consumption, I did notice that even after an hour of gaming I never once heard a fan switch on high rate, which, while I understand the need for this, I still find annoying.Given the price range, I expect this will become a popular card for those that need serious performance with professional level 3D programs."", 'I work at VFX houses in LA, and I\'m not really sold on this product for a number of reasons.- Cost: That\'s a LOT of money for not a lot of Cores.  This has always been true of Quadro series cards, but why? leading to....- Support: Nvidia will tell you you\'re paying for the benefits of a 1) long product life cycle. (true, these cards have been around FOREVER, hence so few cores)  2) high quality support (didn\'t really ever find them helpful when we were having problems with our software Blue-screening these cards out) and 3) custom tailored drivers (again, you\'d try to discuss the potential of a bug in their drivers and they just were not interested at all)  So it\'s possible that they\'re telling the truth, but it seems like they\'re only interested in you if you\'re company name starts with Autode and ends with dobe.  This was offensive given that we had like 75 of these cards and they were failing in product demos for our clients.- Reliability.  In our Supermicro 8-12 core workstations, this was the most common component failure, company wide.  Most VFX houses you\'d think pop render nodes, but we were just always losing these cards, about once a month at the worst point.  A huge time hole, given what a PIA returns and exchanges are.- Driver quality.  This is a tough area to place blame.  Our artists would suffer 3DS max and Maya crashes ALL THE TIME.  Sometimes this is the artist\'s fault for cramming too much into a file, sometimes it\'s the 3D software... On the other hand, we did find a previous revision of the Nvidia driver that seemed to make the greatest number of our machines the most stable, most of the time.  This would imply issues with the driver, in particular the latest driver.  This would all be trial and error of course.  Another huge time hole.  If progression theory in development is to be believed, the safe assumption should be that the most recent non-beta driver release is the most stable, but this is not the case here. Updating can mean more crashing.- Let\'s take a step back and be fair here for a moment. I don\'t know what it would be like to run a VFX house on a gaggle of ever changing desktop gaming cards.  For all I know it would be an even greater nightmare. For all I know, no maya or 3DS max project would open the same on any two computers. I could be overlooking a much darker and much more insane world, and that\'s basically their sales pitch.  Nvidia will tell you to buy a company\'s worth of these cards to have consistency on the vague threat of ""MORE"" problems if you don\'t.I\'d be curious to see that scenario play out with a neutral 3rd party that doesn\'t profit off the selling of crazy overpriced hardware.', ""I did a lot of research on Qaudra Fermi Series and their semi twins GeForce GTX 400 & 500 Series. On the papers, they look almost identical. But the key difference is , GeForce is engineered for FPS (Frame rate in games), while Quadro is engineered for display complex model in 3D programs. Plus all 3D programs have designated driver for Quadro series, and will not help you if you have a software issue with unsupported GPU card. GeForce GTX 400 series has some display issues with 3Ds Max at the time I was doing my research(6 months ago), I'm not sure it got solved or not. Gaming cards tent to have display issue like chappy rotation, missing lines and crashes, if you have complex model or a large scene.Majority of rendering engines are GPU base now, so you might not need this mid range Quadro if you don't deal with modeling much. You still need a quadro card for setting up the scene. Nowadays the common setup for rendering pro is, get a entry level quadro fermi card for display and modeling; and get one or two Geforce GTX card for rendering. GeForce GTX are in PCI slots but not connected to any monitors. And only install Quadro driver for display. Rendering engines will seek out all available GPU on your machine.Bottom line, if you're a 3D pro who do a lot of modeling then this card will save you time and headache = money. If you're setting up a mini render farm, then Geforce GTX is more cost efficient. If you're like me who do a bit of everything, modeling, rendering, texturing and gaming (this card does pretty well on HD games), then this card is perfect for you. It does get pretty hot, make sure your machine have a good air flow. I have two 80mm fans (with fan speed control) to keep it cool."", ""This GPU allows me to model 3D characters, renderer in real-time, and utilize all Photoshop CS5's 3D features.  It does seem to work with old and modern games (BF1942 - MOH Beta) as a bonus.  Windows Experience Index (Win7 Ultimate) puts the Quadro 4000 at 7.3 out of 7.9.  I forgot what the Cinabench marks were and I'm logged into another partition on that workstation right now and it's busy so I can't check.Only negative note is that I did notice Autodesk's Mudbox slow a little while using the built in video screen capture.  I don't know if this is a Autodesk issue or if the GPU was taxed.  I'll try different video screen capture software to find out.Download the drivers from Nvidia's website.  Do not use the ones on the disk that comes with this GPU.If you're like me and you want a 42'' LCD TV 2 ft from your face when you're modeling you are going to want a HDMI-to-DVI video adapter.  You will not get one of these in the PNY box.  I went with the Monster Cable Ultra and yes it does plug right into the DVI slot on the GPU though it doesn't look like it will.  Oh, and sound does come out of your TV speakers through the HDMI adapter.  I was thinking I would have to run an optical out from my mobo to my home theater receiver just to listen to some video tutorials.  Not the case at all.If you are new to building computers, like I was, you may be interested in knowing you will have to plug this GPU into your PSU.Shipping was free and I got it within 2 days.The Quadro 4000 does not disappoint for mid-range multi-media creation."", ""I bought this card because I wanted professional grade performance and reliability. I got the first, but so far not the latter.The card worked brilliantly for the first couple of months. I use a variety of graphic-intense utilities like Maya, Blender, and GIMP on a regular basis. This card chewed through very dense 3D geometry models with ease. For sure, this card runs at a higher average temperature than most, but that's what the low-profile, high-performance design will get you, so no complaints there.After a couple of months the card would shutdown (screen goes black & system locks up) after just a few minutes of use. I discovered that the fan just wasn't running at all - so the card idled itself up to >100 deg C and shutdown. PNY quickly accepted my RMA request and sent me a new card. (Kudos to their fast response). However, the replacement card had the same issue! (Anti-kudos for a faulty replacement). The fan on this card will sporadically work, but most often exhibits the same fan issue as the first, leaving me unable to do my work. I am now on my 2nd RMA with this card.To PNY's credit, their support has been relatively easy to deal with - quickly granting RMAs and providing other helpful diagnostics along the way. However, I am overall displeased with the reliability of their product. Like I said, I bought this card expecting professional performance and reliability. Still waiting for the second half."", ""It's a 12 year old card, overpriced under performing on today's web. It's also slow and not much good at anything other than showing you video images. It's not good for production work, or gaming, just browsing. Nobody would ever buy this card if it weren't for the gpu shortages....I bought it only to get my tower going again..why let so much money just sit there you know?..Just the honest truth. This is what you end up with when you don't have aa credit card to afford one....merry christmas and yay..."", ""Installed this into an HP Elite desktop (Windows 7 64-bit OS). It fit with only about 2 mm clearance to spare at the ends of the board, but it does fit & it works well. I run NX mechanical CAD and the graphics performance is good.The only issue I had, a minor one, was that the installation instructions were not too clear about whether I was to hook up one or two power leads to the board. I interpreted the instructions to say I needed only one power cable hookup, but it turned out I should have hooked up two. I called PNY's technical support line after hours & left a message describing my question. The next morning a technician called me back & clarified that in my case I needed two power hookups. The tech was knowledgeable, helpful & pleasant. Because I had only run the computer briefly with just the one power hookup (to make sure everything powered up OK, and to download the latest driver), no harm was done.This graphics board performs well and I appreciated the timely call-back & helpful tech support."", 'Website stated would work, when I received package, stated would not work, my Dell Only HP.Returned, and they refunded my money quickly once they received the package back.They should have stated on WEBsite, the device was ony for HP.', 'IT is great a great product overallperformance 5power consumption 5installation 5this cards have dedicated software to increase performance  in programs such as Photoshop, After Effects, Premier (especially this one with mercury renderer), 3d max and more.i have already tested this gpu on every and each of the software listed above plus Zbrush.this can still get fps and good game performance... its  the best for the value, and definitely its better then the previous quadro series.This is superior to Quadro fx 3800. and competes closely with the Quadro FX 4800. wich in this case was replaced with the quadro vcq 5000 wich is a monster too.recomend it for profesional or high end amateur use. probably was the best purchase  ive made setting my new computer.']"

Not a game card, don\'t expect blazing graphics, but for what I needed it for, it has been great. I will update if something bad happens with it.', 'Why would you buy an ""VGA"" card today? In my case, it\'s to free up a PCI-e slot for a 10GB ethernet card in a server. The other PCI-e x16 slot is already hosting an 8-port SAS disk controller, so to add the ethernet card, I had to fall back from a PCI-e graphics card to a basic PCI graphics card.  That\'s okay for my particular situation -- this is in a server, which will basically never run a desktop. I need a graphics card to see BIOS screens on startup and for certain kinds of debugging (home server, not a fancy remote environment with IPMI cards or such).Works with Windows, Solaris, and Ubuntu desktops in my experimenting so far, though. It\'s certainly a bit slow for anything graphically complex; the only reason one would want such a card today is for systems that just barely need a graphics card at all.  But, for those cases, a cheap basic VGA is perfect.']"

Open the case, remove the old card, put in the new card, close the case, super easy. Do look in your computer or computer manual to see what the watts are on your power supply before you buy any new graphics card. I did that so was not surprised.  This is a smaller card than what I had, so I had to swap out the metal bracket part and use the taller one, but that was just a couple of screws.My new monitor did not come with a DVI cable, so I had to hook it up using one of the VGA to DVI converters that are included with this card.

This particular video card was recommended by Dell for my computer, so I went ahead and purchased it.  It does support two monitors, although I only have one.  The installation was pretty straightforward and I was able to get my computer up and running, but it didn't solve the startup problem that I had.  I downloaded the driver for it off the internet, totally unaware that an instruction manual and driver CD were very well hidden in the package the video card and attachments came in.  At any rate, I came to discover that videos on the internet would only show a green screen and a few brief seconds of audio.  Putting the LCD screen at a high resolution fixed that for awhile, but the icons on the desktop became very small and I didn't feel like having to use a magnifying glass with my computer.  I delved into the manual and found that some settings deep in the computer may have needed changed.  I decided to contact customer support by telephone, but they are only available during the week.  I sent an e-mail for support over two weeks ago, but have yet to get a response.  At this point, it didn't matter anyway as I made the decision to go back to the old video card - it was less problematic and saved me $100.  I am very grateful for Amazon's return policy that it was so easy to send this item back - I give Amazon five stars, but I would give this product 0 stars if I could have.UPDATE (6/1/13):  This card was originally purchased for a Dell Inspiron 530 that is now just over five years old.  Since late in 2012, this computer has had an issue on startup where the CPU would power up, shut off, power up, shut off, power up then proceed with booting up.

In the viewport the fps does not appear to be faster than any other gaming or professional card but as expected the geometry and the wireframe looks great with very decent antialiasing and no artifacts. The color in shader mode ( 5 key) looks more accurate. I was expecting some acceleration with Hight Quality Rendering under the Rendering submenu but it is too slow, way more than the Default Rendering on the same card. 1/4 aprox. in texture mode ( 6 key) and 1/6 in lighting mode ( 7 key). So I am using the Default Quality Rendering. You can feel the card working because it stars slower rotating heavy models and in less that a second it gets to its top speed and stays there. It is very stable, looks great and accurate and never crashes. I have been using this card for more than 2 weeks.Anyone, like me, expecting faster manipulation, rotating or scaling in the viewport window with professional graphic cards may be a bit disappointed. I think this is a software limitation in Maya because I can observe a similar top speed limit with other cards on Macs and PCs, even gaming cards have similar manipulation speed. But once you see how stable, accurate and smooth it runs you will never want to go back to gaming cards. And if you want better quality and faster hardware rendering speed the more expensive and powerful professional cards are the way to go.Installation was not so painful but I needed to restart Windows 2 times to see the card perfectly working and as advised you need to remove any prior graphic drivers from ATI or Nvidia. I installed the latest Maya drivers from the Nvidia website and then I selected Maya as the 3D environment in the Nvidia control panel with 4x antialiasing. Not so manny choices there and I am not an expert in this regard so maybe with more experience someone could take more advantage of this card.I went with this particular model from Nvidia because in my research this was the best entry level card around $160, even better than the ATI 3750 with 256 MB of memory. It is a bit faster than the similar ATI card, has more memory and is faster in more professional applications. On many reviews this card is almost as fast as the top Pro cards in general. I am using this model with a Shuttle PC with 4MB 800 DDR2 Corsair memory and a Q6600 at default 2.4 ghz. This machine makes a great portable and affordable ""mobile"" workstation. Be aware that if you install this HP card on a non qualified HP machine you will lose the warranty but on the positive side is cheaper than the PNY FX580.', 'As mentioned by another reviewer, this card is commercialized by HP for HP workstations, and includes a sticker saying that the warranty is void if used in a different machine. Documentation is sparse, and I there is nothing about the card connectors, especially the two on the board. I believe one of them is used for SPDIF audio passthrough to the HDMI/DP connectors, but I will have to do trial and error here. Even though the card is the same one, either sold by Nvidia, HP or PNY, the information and warranty varies, as well as the price. Still I prefer the HP that costs significantly less than the PNY, though now warranty in my case. I used the latest driver from Nvidia site and worked fine.', 'The tag line ""by Hewlett Packard"" should read ""FOR HEWLETT PACKARD ONLY!""This card was purchased to replace an ATI Radion Card that was failing to the point of barely usable.I work with a dual monitor setup and use Adobe\'s suite of graphics programs and View 7, etc. So I needed the rendering capabilities inherent with the Quadro series cards. After a thorough explanation of my work and usage habits to Customer/Technical Support at Nvidia, (very limited gaming) they recommended the 370.  Given the price, stepping up to the new FX 580 seemed like a no-brainer, and it was.However, the only choices for card manufacturers were HP and PNY. PNY\'s Customer/Technical Support ratings were poor so I went with HP.  It was purchased on Amazon on a Wednesday evening and it came in on Friday morning.  Perfect.  Unfortunately, it was not clear prior to purchase that the card was intended for HP workstations ONLY, or that use in other systems would void the warranty.  My bad, should have researched that further.Nevertheless, I installed the card anyway, and then downloaded the latest drivers from the Nvidia website and it worked fine. The card was very easy to install. It only draws 45 watts of power so there was no need to upgrade the power supply. It is also very quiet.

I am configuring my somewhat older system for mostly stock market charts, and 1 live video capture (PCI Sat card). My original idea was to just purchase another cheap display adapter for the second unused slot on my mainboard. My mainboard is a GIGABYTE P67A-UD3 and there is 2 PCIe x16 slots, so I made good om my original idea.  I bought a new shiny, and very cheap AMD HiS graphics adapter with dual outputs to go along side my old trusty Nvidia Galaxy 8800GT adapter (that also has dual HDMI outputs). Everything worked fine for about a 5 minutes then -low and behold. I kept getting- AMD driver just recovered from a terrible, terrible, error, but fixed itself in the knick off time, so relax -everything is under control message, or something like that :-0. After a while it was bringing my system down hard when I would move a window around to another display, sometime just maximizing a window. I spent a day updating drivers and stuff. Rather then spend a week trying to continue to find the problem, and risk corrupting data on my drives; I just pulled the AMD HiS display adapter out, and ordered this one.  I ordered one at a discount, so when I received the box it did not come with the adapters for the the vga/hdmi port to display port. Next I drove a hour to the computer store and bought 4 HDMI to  display port adapters. Guess what, it was not a corded adapter, but fixed  with a wide section for the HDMI to plug into- kinda like a usb stick with one large end. Currently I can only plug 2 of these adapters in because they overlap and conflict with each other. So the heck with it, I can plug in only 2 adapters right now for 2 monitors, or I can buy the proper adapters that has a cord, so a person can plug 4 monitors into 4 display ports on the 1 display adapter card like this product is intended for. One other thing to mention, if you have any of those VGA to HDMI adapters and plug that adapter into another adapter namely a HDMI to display port adapter- your display might not work, mine didn't, but windows 7 OS claims otherwise.  Currently I have left the Nvidia NVS 450 in the first slot, and I put my old trusty Nvidia 8800GT card down below it. I can say my system is running fine, the two Nvidia cards are not fighting each other, and I can drag windows around with out the system hanging and crashing. 3 Monitors are large LED displays (LG E2041) and of same size, the other one is a a very large LCD (Acer P223W). The temperature of the NVS 450 card is 67C, that's with the PC side case cover open, and the AC on in my room. There is no cooling fan on this adapter, its dead silent which is nice. So I guess I am happy so far, Win7 installed its own Nvidia driver with out a hitch, so I am not going to mess with it or install extra stuff. This device shows up as being 2 display adapters in your windows devices tab. I am guessing 1 GPU serves two display ports, and there is two GPU's on the adapter. According to my APC UPS software- my system is drawing the same amount of power, which is weird being that I have two display adapters running(one of them being power hungry) from just the one before.Conclusion- I am just using 2 displays for this adapter with identical monitors at the moment until I order the correct HDMI to Display port adapters. And lastly and most importantly this beats that dud AMD Hi5 card (dual outputs) that almost made my system broken. I can't stand trouble shooting things at the bios level, or hardware conflicts. Power on, power off, hard reset, power on, force power off, turn off power supply, pull memory, start pulling things out, change bios settings.......  You all know the drill :-) No conflicts that I noticed so far, and a stable system. The 1 sheet instruction that came in the box only mentions XP and Vista. With Windows 8 about to be released Nvidia might want to think about updating this card. Hope you liked my review.

I did order the EVGA GeForce 6200 Graphics Card Video Card 512-A8-N405-KR from Amazon, and it installed and works perfectly."", 'I installed this PCI card in a Dell Dimension 2400 running Windows 7 Professional. The reason I upgraded my video was to run Windows 7 Aero. It worked perfectly from the beginning and Aero is now up and running. I downloaded the latest Nvidia drivers from the Nvidia website and put them on my desktop for easy access. I made sure the video setting in the BIOS was set to auto. I disabled my onboard video in Device Manager. Shut down the computer and installed the card. Turned on the computer and ran the video driver software that was on my desktop. The driver software ran, found the card and installed the drivers. Rebooted the computer and I was up and running. The manual for this card says it needs a 350 watt power supply but I installed it fine with the stock 200 watt power supply that was already in my computer. I have been using this card for over 2 weeks with no problems.', 'this thing is great it just pops in the pci slot 1 screw ur done it said to have a 350+watt power supply but it ran fin for the 1 day till i got my new 500watt power supply.it has 2 monitor outputs(i have 3 now with the old built in vga plug) i have a hp 20""hp2009m lcd 1080 pixel monitor and the picture is 100X better than it wasonly bad things were it was really glitchy at first and it wants to chop my desktop pic off at the bottom (still has all the icons tho)it is a tight fit in my hp a820n tower but fit fineand the worst is that i have a none clear tower this thing looks sweet!!!4 out of 5 stars its great for $50.00over all you just cant go wrong with PNY hardware', 'Impressed with the overall performance because my expectations were of the worst but i added this graphics card to an older HP workstation with a 2.6ghz pentium 4 and the card will run crysis 2 on advanced settings, modern warfare 2 normal settings with depth of field off, Dead Island on Medium settings and Skyrim on medium settings, overall happy with purchase because it was the only PCI video card with a decent price.p.s. works even better with msi afterburner.', ""I bought this card after my Geforce 6800 died.  With mounting frustration I tried for three weeks to get this card to work with my Intel motherboard but could never get a throughput signal to my monitor.  I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers, upgrading the drivers on both the video card and the motherboard, freeing up resources, resolving memory and IRQ conflicts, upgrading my power supply, cleaning all the motherboard conflicts, and everything else I could think of doing.  Finally I removed it from my desktop and plugged it into a friend's computer where it works just fine.  So I suppose I can say it is a great card it just doesn't work with every computer motherboard."", 'This is a good video card for older computers that only have PCI slots for upgrades.  I upgraded an old Dell Dimension 2400 with it and it improved the performance of the computer.  The power requirements of the card were higher than the stock power supply in the computer, so I replaced that too.  Make sure to check the power specs of any card before inserting into an older computer as it can damage the mother board if it exceeds the power requirements.I would only recommend this card for older computers 5-plus years old or cheaper/cost effective computers as there are much more powerful video cards out there for more modern and powerful computers.', ""What a waste! The $50.00 I spent for this video card. I bought to upgrade a sr1151nx graphic card pc. After I installed it, it worked for a couple of minutes and the computer froze up. I had to unplug the power cord from the back since I wasn't able to do a hard shut down. When I tried to turn the pc back on, there was no POST, no video. I have tried it on even some new computers I built it doesn't work. Not only I wasted my $50.00 but I lost also my old SR1151NX PC which I liked."", ""Where I work most users have three monitors. The computers use the on-board video, and a PCI video card. I have two computers (soon to be three) that use this card, and they work like a champ for what we use it for. Works well in Windows XP, and in Windows 7 64-bit.We don't run any games so I can't comment on that, but if you need to run dual or more monitors for office related programs, this card is the one for you."", ""Strangely, Windows 7 did not install a default driver for this card.  So I went to Nvidia's web site, and down loaded the current driver software and installed it.  This card works great! And compared to  the baby video chip on the motherboard of this older computer, this video card gave the entire computer a speed boost.  I recommend it."", 'Works good. Was well packaged and shipping was fast. This was really just an add on to allow for a multiple monitor setup. Not used for anything graphics intensive']"

Aber vorerst muss ich hier 5 Sterne geben, weil ich absolut nichts zu meckern habe.Wer aktuelle Spiele wie Assassins Creed Origins spielen will oder GTA 5, und kein 4K braucht, der muss sich nicht so eine teure Karte kaufen, weil diese zumindest für meinen Einsatzzweck im Moment sehr überdimensioniert ist.', 'Kurze Review für Gamer/Content CreatorTL;DR (Too Long; Didn\'t Read): Obwohl es sich hier um einer der günstigsten Varianten handelt, spreche ich eine absolute Empfehlung aus.Verbaut in (Specs):Prozessor: i5 6600K @ 4,5Ghz (Overclocked)Grafikkarte: Asus GeForce GTX 1080 TurboRAM: 32GB - 4x 8GB DDR4 Corsair Vengeance LPX 2400MhzSSD: 256GB für Betriebssystem and Tools, 128GB für Content Creating (Blender, Openshot, etc.)HHD: 1TB & 2TB für Games (eigentlich ein Sünde ich weiß, es reicht dennoch! :) )Gaming:Alle Einstellung auf Ultra bzw.

I replaced my 2 GTX 280 cards SLI with 2 GTX 480 cards SLI and it tears thru Just Cause 2 with doubled the frames rates at a stable 60fps (was about 30fps with 2 GTX 280 cards with 16x AA) with everything cranked up all the way with 32x AA (that's right 32x AA!), 16x AF, and 1920x1080 resolution. This is the most stable card NVidia has come out with so far for SLI and is Dx 11 compatible. This card does like the power and it does run hot under full load, but this is always the case for the highest performance cards. At idle it runs about 51C to 55C and under full load it runs about 90C to 92C. This is not a problem if you use a Full Tower Case with plenty of ventilation. The fans do not go higher than 78% under full load at 92C so the noise level is not too bad. For those who want the highest performance out of a single GPU card or for SLI this card is worth the money, especially since it has a Lifetime Warranty from EVGA (make sure you register within 30 days of purchase).

Since this is a new card, there are some driver issues but that\'s to be expected. I get a ""hiccup"" every so often while playing games (compared to using a 285 GTX) but again - this is the driver and Nvidia will come out with newer ones as time goes on.', ""While I'll keep this shorter, the heat issues, dont really exsist in the manner most think it would, yes it runs warm but well within tolerance, and as bout as warm as any other card I've owned, to be honest anyone buying it now is pretty much an early adopter as not too many dx11 games are out yet, but there are a few, Bad Company Two has a bit of support adding soft shadows which is just one extra detail to make the game look even prettier, Dirt 2 is also just a fun game to look at although there isnt too muh tesselation in that game but with all the tech in the card be on the lookout for games to take advantage of it down the road. Perfromance is amazing, I can max whatever I want at 1920x1200 (max supported by my monitor) and nothing can cause it to stutter. the folding numbers are a vast improvment if you're into folding@home project and down the road as driver maturity continues I'm excited to see what becomes if this card."", 'I have had this card since last year and it still blazes the new games being released.  I can play BF3, Crysis 3, Farcry 3 with no problems at 45fps or more with effects turned on high to maximum.  I would recommend this card to budget gamers especially if you can get it under $200.  Just make sure you have good ventilation and at least 4 fans to get good airflow to keep it cool.  I run my fan at 75% with minimal noise and my card stays at 37 C idle, and depending what game, 60-95 C.  The fan will kick on to 100% at 105 C to keep it cool and it will be loud so be aware of that.....', ""Best card i've ever owned.

I have 2 and they work harmoniously together. The only problem is with most games you really HAVE to tweak all the setting in any freshly installed game in order for the cards to perform well at the games highest settings, otherwise it will run at full load all the time when it really doesn't need to, and this can cause some heat problems. But all in all it is an amazing card, and you can't beat EVGA's lifetime warranty policy! If you order this card from Amazon, then registering this card for EVGA's lifetime warranty couldn't be easier (I HIGHLY recommended you register this card with EVGA, AS SOON as it arrives)!  5/5"", ""Well, the other reviewers basically have this card nailed but I figured I'd put in my two cents.  Replaced my 9800gx2 sli setup with just one of these GTX480 cards.  The big difference is the fact that the new card is much quieter and generates much less heat.  Sure, it still makes more noise and heat than onboard graphics... but if you're looking at buying this card I'm sure that does not bother you one bit.Framerates are excellent in all the games I've played with it.

I want to look down upon the nay-sayers this card is worth every penny.  It is not a revolution it's an evolution of the already good 8800GTS 512 G92 version.  If it were a revolution you would be seeing these retailing for $600+  I get astounding frame rates in all of my games.  I play Call of Duty 4 MW multiplayer on max everything and it is beautiful and smooth.  Thank you amazon!"", ""GREAT card. Just don't expect to play cysis full effects (with no overclocking). But if you wanted to get all that, then you'll get another card. It's a long card as well but it did fit in my\xa0\nNvidia 690 Case without PSU\n\xa0with approx 1.5inches to spare. I still have the box. Couldn't throw it away because of the picture. SWEET Turbo design. THIS should be their signature icon."", 'I Bought this video card few months ago, excellent, if you are not too enthusiast, I recommend this for you.']"

This thing kicks major butt in Crysis and pretty much anything else.The one flaw it seems to have is a poorly programmed cooler that only speeds up once the temps have reached nearly critial ranges. I highy recommend reprogramming the fan controller settings in the bios or else using a 3rd part app to keep it cooler, especially for overclocking, which it is also excelent at. I was able to pull off 700/1000 up from 640/950! (and this model is already OC'd from 600/900 stock speed)It does need a pretty good power supply, but i can run it just fine with a 305W in my Dell E521 without any issues, so make sure you have adequate amps on your +12v rail and you'll be fine. The single slot design works great with those dumb Dell BTX chassis' that do not allow for dual slot solutions to fit at all."", ""This card was a huge upgrade for my system, and I'd recommend it to anyone at this price.  I'd never installed a graphics card before, but it wasn't difficult. I'm playing every game i own at high framerates with every setting maxed out.  I haven't tested it yet, but supposedly it can handle Crysis (by far the most demanding game out right now) at medium settings.Important: Unless you already have a good one, expect to upgrade your power supply when you buy this.  XFX recommends you use a 500 watt power supply (600w for SLI).  Don't buy a generic one either, they are notoriously bad quality.  A good one costs around $60 and up."", 'XFX support has not failed me, card failed after three weeks ( no video out) and they fixed it within three weeks (lifetime warranty). Fan was runnning full speed and XFX sent new fan assembly same day - no questions asked. Card is work great,, will look for upgrade in a couple of years from XFX.', ""What can I say; this is one of the best graphic cards I've ever own. It's fast and the dual monitor I have works great. Great product and seller is also awesome"", 'Very fast, cheap and stable graphic card.It does not become too hot even in very hot days.It presents a very good cost x benefit compromise', 'UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU ALTA CALIDAD SENDA TARGETA PULLADA Y SE LLEGA A 700/1000 DURICIMO ANALIZADA POR EL TEAM PAIXAO,S (EDU MURILLO Y GEAN GIARDINA) VENEZUELA LA RECOMIENDO 100%', ""I'm running two of these in SLI mode and the results couldn't be better.
