I was sad that it happened, but its my fault. I was looking for a mid price, something quiet as I often use my laptop during the night, and I dont want to disturb my family members. So this mouse had a good rating in terms of price/performance and that made me choose it. It doesnt need cheese or any food, but good care will make it live a long life. The mouse is very easy to move around, fits in my big palm niecly and has a sleek design that allows long mouse usage without feeling any strain in my wrists. this would also contribute to my higher productivity', 'Not for gaming. But for normal work is good', ""Good Design. Silent while clicking.The mouse is a bit delicate, don't let it drop.The receiver felt a bit loose."", 'nice mouse', 'product is unusable, keep on disconnecting, bad performance. i can by a non branded mouse and it work better than this.

Constantly sticking and lagging, the help options and troubleshooting don't change anything. This is just a very expensive dud product.Don't waste you money."", 'Antes de comprarlo es bueno que vean algunos reviews en YouTube, para saber todo el provecho que pueden sacarle y decidirse a la hora de hacer su compra, para mí en lo personal, el mouse es de muy buena calidad en su ensamble, se siente los materiales buenos, y es recomendable para personas que trabajan más de 8 horas frente al computador, su precio lo considero justo, lo compré en 1499, si lo encuentran por debajo de ese precio, considero que está bien, en base a sus características, recomendado.', 'Es un mouse muy robusto y lo he usado por un par de meses sin mayores problemas. En ocasiones se llega a desconectar cuando utilizo el rodamiento (scroll) rápidamente. Sin embargo, esto pudiera deberse a mi sistema. La duración de una batería completamente cargada es de aproximadamente 8 semanas. El mouse no puede utilizarse alámbricamente, es decir, siempre se debe utilizar el dongle (conector USB) o la conectividad Bluetooth para funcionar. Me gustó que el mouse se puede seguir utilizando mientras se está cargando. Conozco otras personas que han adquirido el mismo mouse y tienen opioniones similares a la mía.', 'La calidad de los materiales son sólidos y se siente muy bien al usarlo. Me gusta que no es ruidoso en cuanto a clicks, en cuanto a scroll, si estás en el modo pausado si haces un scroll rápido sí suena pero para nada molesto, el modo de scroll continuo es suave como la mantequilla. Ninguna falla al detectar mis 3 dispositivos vinculados al mouse. Muy recomendado', 'Durante años tuve el MX master anterior y mw funcionó muy bien, de hecho hasta hoy se sigue usando. En esta nueva versión creo que se mejoraron dos cosas clave; el botón del pulgar, que tendía a atorarse (de hecho a mí pasada unidad le sucedió y tuve que abrirlo y repararlo) y el otro es la bola de desplazamiento vertical. En pocas palabras Logitech creo que logró corregir todo lo que tenía que corregir y entrega un producto superior en todos los aspectos, incluso el clic silencioso es bastante agradable. Lo recomiendo al cien, aún por el precio que no es tan accesible.', 'Este mouse es perfecto para alguien que busca un dispositivo altamente funcional, con una gran variedad de botones programables para cualquier atajo de teclado o acción dependiente del programa que estás usando. Yo lo uso con macOS, y funciona perfectamente bien por Bluetooth o conectado directamente al ordenador. Si lo quieres usar conectado al ordenador, tiene aún así que estar encendido, o no podrás mover el cursor.Si hay que decir algunos defectos, diría que el color negro que escogí con el tiempo van apareciendo marcas de grasa de la mano, sin importar que tan cuidadoso seas a menos que lo limpies todos los días después de que lo uses. También, de vez en cuando se mueve extraño, saltándose pixeles en mi pantalla y con movimiento no fluido usándolo por Bluetooth. He notado que es porque coloco un dispositivo electrónico justo a un lado del mouse, pero cuando lo quito, parece que el problema se soluciona.Por el precio de este mouse, debería de ser el mejor que has usado nunca y creo que se gana ese título si estás buscando un mouse para productividad. En caso de quererlo para gaming, no lo recomiendo tanto ya que es bastante más pesado que un mouse normal.', 'Melhor mouse que já tive, bateria dura MUITO tempo. Em conjunto com o MX Mechanical faz um kit fenomenal.***IMPORTANTE***O usb para conexão é o mesmo para o teclado MX Mechanical, e somente esse modelo!', 'Nunca había invertido tanto en un maouse. Pero fue satisfactorio el usarlo desde el primer momento. El material bien al tacto. Fluido fácil configurar y puedes personalizar cada boton por cada aplicación. En mi caso uso muchos ilustrator y photoshop así que uso atajos distintos y me ha permitido ahorrarme pasos y ser más rápido y productivo. Definitivamente una buena inversión. La batería le dura bastante y puede cargarse mientras se sigue usando por cierto.']"

Worth it. Sleek modern design. Light weight. Easy to pair', ""After 7-years, my iMac keyboard and mouse gave up the ghost. This works really well and all I have to do is get used to it. Other than that, I'm very happy for the price and how tactile the keys feel."", ""I needed a wireless keyboard and mouse combination for my older Windows XP computer and ordered this set immediately when I found it here. Thank you sellers for the very quick next day delivery!Setting it up was a breeze and you will need triple A batteries for both the keyboard and mouse. The set comes with it's own USB receiver. One receiver for both keyboard and mouse. The response is quick and there's hardly any noticeable lag.Both keyboard and mouse are very quiet too, but if you prefer a more tactile feel, then this might not be for you as the keys do not have that mechanical feel, understandably due to the price factor. Same with the mouse buttons too, which I would prefer slightly more depth.If you are a casual typist looking for a beautiful wireless keyboard and mouse, this would be ideal for you. There are other colors currently available too.I hope this review helps."", ""The Keyboard works well, although I'm not used to the smaller Enter key and keep hitting \\ instead... thats just a learning thing.The mouse however is terrible.  I can only get it to work if it is less that 1 foot (30cm) from the USB adapter.  I even tried moving the adapter from the back of the machine to the front so that there was nothing blocking the signal.  The furthest I can get it to work with direct view of the USB dongle is 30cm.  The keyboard works from meters away so this is something in the mouse that doesn't work well.I've had to switch the mouse off and buy a new bluetooth mouse so that I can use the computer.Edit:The supplier contacted me and offered a full refund (in fact they tried to contact me many times but the emails were going to my junk). I would have preferred a working mouse but this was acceptable. I have increased my 2* rating accordingly."", 'The lengthy size of traditional keyboard shrunk thereby could have more table space.Thought i could never find such perfect design of shorter keyboard without giving up calculator format digital key. Over joy to have found it at Amazon, thank you!', ""Because of the current situation, I need to work from home for quite a long period thus was looking out for a good keyboard and mouse set so to work more efficiently. I have been using this set for a week already, no issues so far and thinking to leave a review for those who are also looking out to buy the keyboard and mouse set.I ordered this set and it arrived in 2 days in very good packaging. The setup process is very easy, only one usb receiver is needed and you can use both mouse and the keyboard. I am using a WINDOWS 10 machine, no driver needs to be installed. After plug in the usb receiver and in about 2-3 mins, I am able to use the mouse and keyboard. Very convenient for people whose laptop is short of usb port.Both of the keyboard and the mouse are light weighted, but not too light to slide easily on my table. They all take AA batteries, 2 for keyboard and 1 for the mouse. You don't need a mouse pad to use it together with the mouse, it can slide easily around the tabletop.The keyboard is very sleek and pretty, giving you a well-made look & feel. The sound of the keyboard is just nice, not too loud. The color on the keyboard is silver for the base and white for the key. The keyboard has a number pad also.I would recommend this set and overall i am happy about this purchase."", 'It’s the mouse that keeps giving me trouble. I’ve changed to fresh batteries but it stopped working after a while. I had to continuously click off and on again', 'The delivery was on time. The keyboard is beautiful, and easily to press. The mouse is comfortable to maneuver and very silence when you “click” it. There are two things for improvement: 1. The keyboard keys such as  “backspace” and arrow keys are not quite compatible to Mac Laptop users because the space between them are too narrow, I kept pressing the key next to them. 2. The keyboard and mouse dongle receiver is too tide slotted in the storage space inside the mouse, I have difficulty taking them out.', 'I really like the design of the mouse and it is really quiet with the clicking. However, the keyboard is a little disappointing as the typing sound can get quite loud (keys are a little stiff) although it is slightly better than the normal keyboard. Disadvantage of this set is the color being white, it gets dirty easily. The keys are also placed a little differently from other keyboards so will need a little time to get used to. Height of the keyboard can\'t be adjusted so will need to put something underneath to prop it up. What I love most about this set is that it uses only one USB port to connect both devices. The keyboard uses 2 AA batteries while the mouse needs only one. The keyboard will automatically go into sleep mode within about 10 seconds but it ""awakes"" immediately once a key is hit. The keyboard itself has a function key which is very useful for laptops if the lid is closed when in use. Above are some information that I hope is useful to anyone looking to get a keyboard and mouse set.Overall the design of both keyboard and mouse are cool and I\'m satisfied with this purchase!Edit June 01st, 2021: Bought this in November 2020 and used it for a couple of weeks before I gave my review above. But about three or four months later I had a slight problem with the mouse (left click button is not as sensitive anymore) but I left it as that. In May the left click button is totally not functioning anymore. Wrote directly to seller using the email they provided when they send the product and through amazon about a replacement but no reply from seller to date. I loved this product but the after-sales service is extremely bad. Would not recommend if you\'re looking for support after you get the product otherwise the keyboard and mouse are a really nice combo.', 'Love the slim profile of the keyboard. Absolutely love the mouse too. Probably one of the best mouse I’ve used, and probably better than the popular L brand. Works so silently and nice to hold, I’ve gotten comments bout how satisfying it! :)I like the keyboard’s minimalist profile yet raised profile too. Takes up little space. Very lightweight. Keys are springy and makes clickety clack sounds when typing. Haha. Even though I must say, one of my keys did pop out after travelling in my bag. But easily put back. I don’t mind the quality for this price. Bought a cheaper keyboard+mouse set from shoppee but I’m a lot more satisfied with this.  Thanks seller and Amazon!']"

The Logitech Signature M650 L full size Wireless Mouse has been a revelation in terms of comfort and functionality.

It fits my hand like a glove, providing exceptional comfort during long hours of use. The contoured shape and the soft rubberized grips ensure that my hand stays relaxed and fatigue-free. This mouse truly understands the needs of people with larger hands.2. Precision and Responsiveness: The M650 L boasts impressive precision and responsiveness. The cursor glides smoothly across the screen with precision, making it a joy to use for both work and leisure. One can use the admin console application to adjust the motion speed.  Whether I'm working on detailed design projects or simply browsing the web, this mouse delivers precise control without any lag or jitter.3. Wireless Connectivity: The wireless connectivity is flawless and seamless. The mouse connects effortlessly to my computer, and the included USB receiver offers a stable connection without any dropouts. The long wireless range is an added bonus, allowing me to use it from a comfortable distance.4. Customizable Buttons: The mouse features customizable buttons that can be programmed to perform various functions, which is a great convenience for productivity and gaming. However, the software for customization could be more user-friendly. I am not using them much and will consider them bloat functionality.5. Battery Life: The battery life on this mouse is impressive. It lasts for weeks on a single AA battery, which means I don't have to worry about frequent battery replacements. The battery compartment is easily accessible, making replacement a breeze.Mouse for large hands- think Logitech Signature M650 L I need a slightly bigger version of this mouse for more comfort.

Really handy to have!"", ""Update: After also trying the Fosmon Bluetooth keyboard, this one is still superior.  I intend to test it against a couple others, but I doubt others will have the same level of accuracy with their touchpads. And the scroll wheel is great.----------This mini keyboard offers more features than pretty much all of the others.Left and right buttons toward the top to click.The touchpad is not just the cursor - it allows you to right/left click, highlight, and scroll as you would with a laptop. And it's pretty accurate to be so small.The size is definitely a handheld size. I wish the touchpad was a tiny bit bigger, and I wish the keys were slightly less bulky so it would be a little less awkward to hold.The keys, however, all work well. The scroll wheel is great too! Has a backlight that you can turn off or on as desired. The battery life seems really great too.My main worry with the keys is they seem like they eventually will rub off and you won't be able to see them. I also wish there was a shift key on the right side of the keyboard. But I am getting used to it - not really a big deal. Also I am not sure what the AltGr button does yet (if anything).Now, if we could get something like this with a removable stylus and be able to use the touchpad as a digital drawing pad as well... that would be cool - I am asking too much.Of the available mini keyboard mouse combos available, I recommend this one 100%!!"", ""I'v gone through a number of these with my media PC and this one is far and away the bestPROs- The buttons are big, and very responsive- The touchpad is perfect - my last one was very jumpy, and would move the cursor off the button when you took your finger off the touchpad - even with sensitivity reduced.  Drove me nuts.- Scrollwheel!  Enough said- Options of connection.  BT is convenient but doesn't work on boot to get into BIOS and things like that.  With the 2.4Ghz dongle it's like having a keyboard attached.  For me that's very important.- The shoulder buttons are big and very easy to find in the dark if you just need to pause/play.- The backlight when turned on is very bright!- The backlight comes on automatically for a few seconds when you turn on the keyboard.CONS- There is no dedicated pause/play and FF/RW buttons.  They are each a two key combination.  In some applications  the OK/left/right work for those features - in some they don't.  I may be wrong, but I feel like most people with use this little keyboard for media - and dedicated buttons would be convenient.  If you use Linux it's very easy to reprogram some of the less useful hardware buttons.  I have no idea what the process would be on Mac/Windows.- Turning on the backlight is a two-key combination, which can be a little tricky to find in the dark.  I'm hoping muscle memory will solve this problem shortly.- This seems to be an industry standard on this type of keyboard - I've looked at dozens - but there is only one shift button.  It's only a mild annoyance because nobody is setting typing speed records on this little guy.  With that exception it's a full keyboard - including an AltGR button for accented/special character input, which is great!"", ""The trackpad, keyboard, and button combination on this device is exactly what I was looking for. I needed something small that had good buttons on a keyboard, but also had a trackpad to use as a mouse. This keyboard works like a controller for your computer in all the best ways.The left shoulder button is the left mouse button, and the right should is the right mouse button. This makes it incredibly easy to scroll with the touchpad with my right thumb and click with my left finger.The device seems decently sturdy. Mine came with a USBC port and USB cable for charging. Also, it doesn't mention but this supports 2 different Bluetooth channels for easy device switching. Mine works great on both android phone and windows. I know it is cliche, but don't mess around with other keyboards, the function and form of this is exactly what you need in the category.P.S. I think you can switch out the pads behind the keyboard and 3d print some thicker, controller like grips.

First great thing is it uses usb C to charge. You dont need to go and find that dumb micro usb cable still lingering in your house. Next important feature that the others do not have is left and right mouse click are on top like shoulder buttons on a game controller. This is huge for navigation. Most others simply put them as buttons by the track pad making it very awkward to hold the button and drag something. It also would work great as a keyboard to travel with if you own an Asus Rog Ally or a Steam Deck to navigate through the desktop if needed. Heck you could go on vacation and bring the Ally or Deck and a hdmi cable and just plug up into a tv and use this keyboard to navigate and do actual work on the desk top interface. Sure a laptop is better, but if you where bringing the Ally or Deck anyway saves you the added weight of the laptop.', 'Un clavier Qwerty, donc idéal pour les TV Android, qui ne sont pas en Azerty.Très bonne autonomie, compact, parfait pour le multimédia.']"

Try it out if have issues.We've got an older non-Apple cover for this iPad with a dedicated built-in pencil holder, and it doesn't have this problem - the pencil is easy to take out because the cut sits directly behind the pencil, not slightly on top of it.One other small thing with this is that with Smart Keyboard Folio you can't take the pencil out while the cover is closed.Otherwise, if you try not to look at the price, it's a good product."", 'Works as intended but the price for the product is egregious.']"

Non ho mai utilizzato una trackball prima, perciò non sapevo se mi sarei trovato bene o il contrario. L’esigenza era proprio di posizionarlo sulla scrivania e non muoverlo, avendo già parecchi “attrezzi del mestiere” che occupano lo spazio e devo dire che è stata una bellissima scoperta! Una volta collegato e scaricata l’applicazione per regolarne i tasti e la velocità del puntatore, ci ho preso la mano in meno di un minuto. Consigliato a che come me ha problemi di spazio e cerca un mouse che non affatichi il polso.', 'Ich wollte mal was anderes als die uebliche Maus benutzen, und komme von einer Microsoft Intelli Maus, die kabellose mit den zwei AA Batterien, das Schwergewicht zum Kinder erschlagen.Dieser Trackball ist um Grunde okay. Er liegt gut in meinen grossen Haenden, fuehlt sich angenehm an, alle Tasten sind gut zu erreichen (die beiden zusaetzlichen Tasten an der linken Maustaste sind eine Ausnahme), die Verabrietung ist okay, sie ist per Bluetooth angeschlossen und nicht ueber den Dongle, und das funktioniert bei mir einwandfrei. Die AA(A?) Batterie ist ein grosses Plus, weil ich fest verbaute Akkus wirklich nicht leiden kann: geht der Batterie mal die Puste aus, ist innerhalb von Sekunden eine neue drin, und ich muss nicht erst ein Kabel suchen und anschliessen. Einen Ein-/Ausschalter hat sie auch (den ich immer vergesse) und damit koennte mal die Lebenszeit der Batterie vermutlich massiv erhoehen.Was mich an dem Dingen stoert: Die Intellie Maus von Microsoft ist ein Schwergewicht, und benoetigt Muskelkraft. Zum Bewegen, zum druecken der Tasten. Man kommt nicht ins schwitzen, aber alles ist deutlich schwerer zu druecken als bei allen anderen Maeusen. Ich kann meine Finger auf die Tasten legen, ohne dass diese versehentlich ausgeloest werden: ich muss wirklich druecken.Das ist bei dem Trackball nicht der Fall! Mein Finger liegt auf der Taste, bewusst loese ich keinen Druck auf, und staendig wird die rechte Taste aktiviert, insbesondere wenn ich mit dem Daumen am Ball ""spiele"". Es kommt immer wieder zu Fehlbedienungen, Mausgesten werden im Browser ausgeloest... Es ist ueber einen Arbeitstag verdammt anstrengend den Finger fuer die rechte Maustaste staendig hochzuhalten um die Taste nicht versehentlich auszuloesen. Wenn die Taste in einer Art Rahmen stecken wuerde, und man seinen Finger auf diesem ablegen koennte ohne die Taste zu druecken.Man kann die Empfindlichkeit des Balls einstellen, das ist super, aber es gibt nichts in Form eines Wiederstandes, womit man die Gaenigkeit beeinflussen kann. Das Dingen fuehlt sich ein aufgeblasener Luftballon an, den man nicht unter Kontrolle bringen kann. Es ist natuerlich so sehr einfach und ohne viel Aufwand moeglich den Mauszeiger ueber den Bildschirm zu pruegeln, aber wenn es dann einmal auf Genauigkeit ankommt, wenn man zum Beispiel einen Text markieren moechte, eine kleine Schaltflaeche anklicken moechte, dann hat man mehr Erfolg das Bullseye bei einer Dartscheibe zu treffen.Vielleicht bin ich zu kraeftig gebaut, vielleicht fehlen mir noch ein paar Wochen/Monate Eingewoehnung, aber wie ich mit diesem leichtgaengigen Kram nichts anfangen kann, sollte von diesem Trackball die Finger lassen. Und wer ein Uhrmacher ist und jeden Tag mit winzigen Federn hantiert, der wird mit dem Trackball bestimmt gluecklich.Die mittelpraechtige Bewertung betrifft ausschliesslich die viel zu leichtgaengigen Tasten und den viel zu leichtgaengigen Ball. Und das ist meiner Meinung nach bei einem Trackball (oder einer Maus) das wichtigste.', ""Over the last few years, work always provides me with a Mac rather than a Windows laptop. As such, using a mouse seems to be deemed unnecessary in the Mac world. However, recently I noticed my trackpad hand was getting sore.  This trackball device has really helped.  It did take a bit of time to get used to it and I still use the trackpad for some operations (I can't recall exactly when, but, I have noticed myself occasionally using the TP).  You do have to keep the ball clean, though, otherwise you will notice some friction."", 'Utilisation de la «\xa0boule bleue\xa0» avec le pouce pour diriger le pointeur c’est très spécial au début et je n’ai jamais réussi à m’y faire vraiment.Ceci dit l’ergonomie est interessante pour limiter les dommages sur la main puisqu’elle reste complètement immobile', ""Disclaimer: I'm a first time trackball user and by no means an expert.Also, for anyone else that hasn't used one before, I would like to add that using a trackball is not difficult or hard to get used to, in fact if you're comfortable with a trackpad using a trackball should feel like second nature after only a few minutes of use, certainly did for me.In my quest for the best and cheapest trackball mouse I purchased this logitech M575 and a Perimice 517. Both are of simillar build quality and weight, fairly hollow and cheap feeling plastic all around the main body, not what I was expecting from a brand like logitech. the logitech has a smooth matte texture while the perimice goes for a gripier matte textured coting that's a little closer to rubber. both are simmilar but the perimice gets grubier easier and the logitech is a little smoother, it's really just a matter of preference though. another thing that is a matter of preference would be the shape of the mouse. with my index finger over the left click the perimice was fairly comfortable for me and the extra widh of the design gives somewhere for my pinky finger to rest. with my index on the left click of the logitech comfort was simply awful with my index and middle fingers off angle from the buttons and my pinky with nowhere to rest. If however, I change my grip to have my middle finger on the left clik the comfort of the logitech was darn near perfect, all the buttons are within easy reachand all my fingers rest well on the body of the mouse. on the perimice comfort was eaqualy as okay as before, but not exceptional. I found myself prefering the logitech but adjusting to left click with my middle finger will be tough. The weird grip on the logitech does put the remapable function keys right under my index finger though wich is a huge positive. Unlike the logitech MX Ergo's single large rubber pad these mise use individual feet, on the logitech these feet have a matte finish and keep it firmly planted on a wide range of surfaces. the perimice feet are a glossy finish and I found it was more picky about surface, sliding around a little on my desk mat, the logitech had no such issues. Now, the trackball, the most important part of a trackball mouse. The perimice is rough, the ball feels smooth over lrge rolls but try to move it a small amout to highlit text or select a selection box and you feel the rough movement of the bearings and it becomes difficult to be precise as the mose jumps around, it feels almost like a scroll wheel, not good at all for controlling the cursor. The logitech mouse is fantastic though, almost too smooth., it can be difficult to be precise but in a completely different way, it's like a trackpad that's too sensitive with how smooth it is, much, much better than the perimice. The logitech has some cool features the the perimice doesn't though in the remapable buttons and custom sensitivity settings. the app in which you control these is really annoying and invasive on first setup, it begs for a whole host of data and seems to force you to create a logitech account with no option to not use one, if you close the browser window it opens when you click to create an account and back into the app it seems to work fine without the account. the app itself is really good too, super well designed, easy to use and good looking. something really annoying that might not happen with everyone is that my mouse didn't come paired to the usb reciever meaning I had to download the logitech unifying software and pair them up, this should be done in the factory as this could make the mice unusable for some or at least casue some annoying headaches, trackball mice are often used for applications where space is at a premium, these applications often make use of computers you can't install any old exe onto, enterprise solutions with admin passwords and backend systems not running a regular os like windows. these are the types of situations I would expect this mouse to be used with the usb reciever so for it to not be paired up out of the box is pretty attrocious in my opinion. anyway the actual product itself is pretty good and i would definitley reccomend it, just be weary of the software and know that it's not built great, some have complained of long term issues as well so, again, do be aware of these issues. Certainly better than the perimice though and probably also the other two designs of trackball mouse I found on amazon that were cheaper than this.p.s. There was no proper user manual in my box so the button on the bottom switches from bluetooth to usb reciever, the blue light means bluetooth and the white means usb reciever. if the light is flashing that means it is not connected and a steady light means it is connected. it also takes 1 AA battery and mine came with a GP branded one in the box."", 'Hola,Lo compré para reemplazar un viejo Logitech Trackman Marble, este sin duda es más ergonómico y por lo tanto más funcional porque el posicionamiento de la mano se ajusta mejor y te permite usar los botones con facilidad. Por supuesto lo estoy comparando con uno de los primeros Trackballs de la marca, que me duró muchos años.Quizás, viniendo de un trackball tan antiguo, estoy acostumbrado a tener la mano más paralela a la mesa y no tan inclinada como la tendría en el modelo MX Ergo y eso fue algo que no me hizo gastar un poco más y optar por este. A pesar de ello, la manecilla ahora está inclinada a 45º, mientras que antes con la anterior habría sido de unos 30 o menos.El hecho de que tenga un receptor que se puede esconder en su interior y un botón para cambiar entre conectarse por eso o por Bluetooth tan fácilmente con una simple pulsación, permitirá usarlo en dos ordenadores si lo necesitas, por ejemplo. mi computadora portátil y de escritorio que no tiene bluetooth.Queda por determinar si con mi uso la batería durará tanto como se anuncia pero es muy probable que dure mucho tiempo.Otra cosa que me hizo elegir fue el precio, muy bueno para los productos que vi y considerando las reseñas, no veo razón para no elegir este modelo.Las únicas características que podrían ser determinantes para alguien, podría ser no tener la posibilidad de inclinación que tiene el Ergo, lo probé y confieso que me sorprendió la posición que puse el pulgar, me encontré acercando el dedo a el lado que no lo hice es conveniente e incluso un poco raro de mi parte ya que la mano se sienta de la misma manera. Por supuesto, podría mejorar con el tiempo.Y tal vez un modelo que tuviera mas botones, confieso que sigo sin usar los dos botones adicionales, claro que uso los tres botones normales y el de scroll. Quizá porque aquí usamos el pulgar no podemos darle el mismo uso a los botones extra que en un ratón normal.En cuanto al juego, no lo uso, pero los que me conocen saben que usé el modelo antiguo, y para los que lo usan también, esto es normal, es una máquina de precisión.Algo que mis amigos me vieron hacer durante muchos años cuando jugábamos de adolescentes e incluso lo hicieron recientemente, fue la posibilidad de hacer rodar la bola del trackman, que hace que el movimiento sea más largo y rápido que con el ratón cuando hay que levantarse y reposicionarse. . Esto es posible con solo el movimiento del dedo.Por la enorme estabilidad y el hecho de que es inmóvil, la precisión de los botones junto con la precisión que se gana al rodar, para los que les gusta, es el más preciso para jugar.No le aconsejo a alguien que usa un mouse normal que cambie a un trackball pensando que puede usarlo de la misma manera sin acostumbrarse. Por otro lado, lo prefiero a un mouse normal por la precisión y por poder tener el brazo completamente apoyado sobre la mesa, soy de los que solo podría decir maravillas de trabajar con un Trackball y más aún de Logitech.El botón de encendido y apagado es práctico de tener y la forma de extraerlo y limpiarlo también es muy práctica. Windows instala el software automáticamente y te deja configurar la velocidad de movimiento y poco más.Muy feliz hasta ahora, lo recomiendo!

There are no particular differentiating features about it. Even the available colors are a little bland. However, I think I have looked over all the aesthetic aspects just because the keyboard is so functionally robust. One gripe that I cannot get over is that there is no angle adjustment. You have to become okay with the default angle of the keyboard when it\'s facing you. Granted, I have been using it for the past few weeks and apart from a couple of occasions when the keyboard became a little uncomfortable to use, I haven\'t felt the need to readjust the position of the keyboard on the table all that much.The keys have a decent travel. You will appreciate this much better if you\'re coming from a laptop. The actuation force is a little more than on most laptops, so you might feel you\'re stomping on your laptop keyboard after having used this for a while. The keyboard has been mentioned as ""ultra quiet"" in the description, but the truth is far from it. It is not silent by any means. It makes the same amount of noise that you\'d expect from a membrane keyboard, which is obviously less than a mechanical keyboard. The space bar makes more noise than all the other keys and I am not really sure why that is.Where I love the keyboard the most is in its functions and reliability. It is compatible with both Windows and macOS and I have been switching between both of them multiple times a day and not once have I face any disconnection issues. The keyboard has connected reliably to both my devices. All the media control keys work as expected in both Windows and macOS. I am not someone who regularly uses a numpad, but I am sure people who do will find this to be yet another reason to go over K580 over K480 and K380.The slot on the top of the keyboard is good phone stand in a pinch. I don\'t think it will be able to hold bigger size tablets. My iPad Pro 11 inch obviously doesn\'t fit, but I also don\'t intend to use the keyboard like that. If you\'re buying the keyboard for a tablet, make sure you cross reference the dimensions of the tablet with how big the slot is.Overall, I would recommend this keyboard without a second thought, but only if it is available under Rs 3K. I don\'t think that the price is justified if it\'s more than that.', ""The build quality seems great. I've had no issues a month into use, and haven't had to change the batteries yet. The only notable improvement would be to make it rechargeable for future models (and they probably have by now)."", 'An ergonomic keyboard -- lightweight and exceptionally useful to accompany a WINDOWS laptop. Switching between 2 devic5es is easy and functionally viable. Very happy with mu purchase.Ergonomic', 'In the grand scheme of things, I’m happy with this. I have three computers at the same desk, and this has allowed me to simplify the desk setup by having one keyboard switchable between two computers at the press of a button, rather than swapping the wired connection of my gaming keyboard between my work and personal PCs as I was doing previously. There is also the added bonus that it provides a reasonably inexpensive way of getting a Mac-friendly keyboard with a 10-key numpad compared to a genuine Apple keyboard with the same feature (which was a major attraction).In general terms, it is a nice keyboard to use. Keys are nice and responsive, have a good feel to them, and it is easy to type at a decent speed. Bluetooth pairing is a piece of cake, using the USB dongle just works as you would expect.What complaints I have are really minor foibles rather than any serious gripe, and are probably just something to be aware of as opposed to an argument against the purchase.The keyboard has a blessing-and-curse situation of being quite compact, and fits most, if not all of the keys/features of a standard keyboard in a form factor 1-2 inches narrower than a standard full-featured keyboard. Consequently, there are certain compromises to be made. Instead of having the arrow keys laid out in a standard inverted-T configuration, these are squashed into a smaller box space (like an Apple Magic Keyboard layout); instead of having Home/End/Page Up/Page Down in their own space above the arrow keys, these are laid out in a row above the numpad. For some users this might not make a scrap of difference, but if you spend a fair bit of time in Excel or any other application where you might use keyboard shortcuts involving these keys, things start feeling a bit alien.While I like being able to switch between devices using one of a pair of buttons (not dissimilar to other multi-device keyboards), these buttons also occupy the F11 and F12 buttons. Again, for many this will mean nothing. If, however, you are used to using the F keys for different functions (such as F2, F5 or F12 in Excel) you need to turn the off F-lock on to access such functions, then remember to switch it off to toggle between devices, and turn it back on again when using a device that requires such functions. Again, this is more a minor nuisance than a significant inconvenience, but I’ve inadvertently created any number of charts when what I meant to do was switch from my PC to my Mac.All in all, I think this is targeted more towards someone who primarily uses a single computer and occasionally needs to hop over to a phone or small tablet to bang out quick messages or notes - the massive trough for such a device built into the keyboard provides something of a hint. Can a serious user that divides their time more-or-less equally between two computers operate at peak efficiency on the device? Possibly not, but then again, if such a user values their time and such functionality so highly, they might be prepared to spend a greater sum than the asking price on this keyboard.', 'Very aesthetic and smooth keyboard. Minimal noise when typing and full compatibility with different laptops.', 'This keyboard mainly used for dual purpose, if you have to deal with two terminals, i.e. one monitor and another one is mobile phone terminal, then this is the best keyboard in the market. If you have to work with laptop and desktop with a single monitor and keyboard or if you are working with laptop/desktop with a smart phone then this is the best choice. It works with Bluetooth and USB receiver Dongle.i was extremely happy with this product.', 'Good Multi-Device keyboard (2 devices / supports Win/Mac/iOS). No Backlight, No indication for CAPS LOCK, no direct key for print screen.', 'Easy to connect with mac as well windows laptops.Swapping between two system is also very easy.', 'No light indication for if CAPS is on or off its kinda difficult in situations when typing passwords, I have go to browser search bar or not pad to check what is the case!', 'First impressions of this keyboard - I was amazed by how slim it was!I was originally searching for a seperate keyboard from my laptop so I could study and perform my work adequately. However, the majority of the keyboards on the market did not have an attached numerical pad - which was key to my work and study. Thankfully, the Logitech K580 did.In true Logitech quality, the keyboard is very responsive and also easy (and pleasant) to type with. However, everyone has their own opinions and tastes so like when purchasing a car - you should try before you buy.The best part for me is that I have a Logitech mouse which runs on the Logitech unifying receiver. Both this keyboard and my Logitech MS Anywhere 2S mouse will pair up to the same receiver - so I only require one USB(A) and eliminates any unnecessary additional USB\'s taking up space.This keyboard (and MS Anywhere 2S mouse) can run through the Logitech Unifying Receiver or Bluetooth connection which is very helpful as I have two laptops (one for work and one for study). When switching from one laptop to another, I simply press a dedicated ""grey"" key on the keyboard to switch to the other laptop that I require to use. I do not have to keep taking the dongle out at all. When I am ready to switch back, I simply press the other dedicated ""grey"" key on the keyboard and in a matter of seconds, I am back working on my other laptop. (My study laptop runs my keyboard and mouse through the dongle and my work runs them both through Bluetooth).Upon testing this keyboard out for two to three months, I am very happy and my productivity has increased. No extra keyboards / mouse / dongles etc for each device. Essentially ""plug and play"" elements to this keyboard with Logitech quality.This keyboard can also pair with your mobile devices (which I haven\'t personally tested).As a handy bonus perk - There is a small slotted space for you to place your mobile phone at the top of the keyboard if required.I would definitely recommend this keyboard!']"

It's probably the cheapest price amongst other retailers."", 'I purchased one of these back in Dubai for my office and decided one to purchase one for my home too. But Amazon over there ran out of devices. So i decided to buy one from the Indian website since i was travelling here. So, my comparison is based on the one that I had purchased back in UAE and not on the standalone basis. The one UAE that i have almost identical what i have however the keys are very tactile and have a very clicky feeling to it. It feels more premium then the one tht i got here. Probably because it was slightly more expensive over there. This one while it is good has a hard key return which makes the whole feeling very rubbery. I mean the keys are harder to press and takes more effort then that One i had purchased back in UAE. While this one too is good, its not the same thing and makes the writing more difficult. Thats why i have deducted one star. Probably i would have given 5 stars Had i not used the one back in UAE, Also, i purchased the white version of the keyboard thinking it will match my table.

Does not feels nice to see.5) Makes banging sound on desk while typing due to misalignment.6) Wont use the mobile/tab slot to keep mobile/tab while typing as the depth is more - hides screen of the mobile/tab and its may also damage the screen.Verdict -I will buy it for offering a USB+BT connection and for aesthetics. Otherwise would go for a cheaper alternative.', 'I have been using the keyboard for more than 2 weeks now and it is quite effective.

Only thing that is missing are: a) some LED indicators to indicate CAPS LOCK, NUM LOCK, b) some LED indicator to indicate which device is connected, and c) some arrangement by which the keyboard can be raised from front for a better tilt leading to a better typing experience. The tilt angle is too low for long duration of work.']"

I've purchased a second one to use with my new gaming laptop. I shopped for other options, and I didn't find anything I'd consider comparable for under $40. I recommend combing through the various features of this mouse presented in the listing, as it has a lot to offer. Below are six reasons I chose the M720 a second time, separated and numbered for convenience.1) I've never had a connection issue with either the dongle or Bluetooth. Again, it's been over five years.2) The battery life is amazing. I have to change the single AA battery once a year, MAYBE twice some years. The new mouse also came with a Duracell already inside, and a plastic tab to pull out, indicating that it is fresh.3) The responsiveness of the cursor on-screen to the mouse's movement is accurate and feels natural.4) I've never had need of the three side buttons, but it's a really nice feature. I very rarely accidentally press the side buttons, but when I do, it's quick and effortless to correct.5) The finish is matte rubber, which to me looks much higher quality than shiny, hard plastic. The texture is smooth and soft, doesn't stick to your skin during long periods of use, and feels good. It's also worthy to note that the bottom of the mouse is no longer white like in the photos, it is now black to match the rest of the design. I like it better.6) The shape, size, and weight of this mouse are perfect for me. The indentation on the left side holsters my thumb comfortably, while the high, rounded part on the top fits securely in my palm beneath my index and middle knuckles. It does not require much of a grip at all. My hand rests naturaly and operates the mouse with minimal effort. It's a great multi-functional choice, capable of supporting me through many hours, and is suitable for browsing, work, and gaming."", 'Llevo más de 6 de uso con el y la batería no ha bajado casi nada.

Hats off to Logitech. It\'s more glamorous, much more expensive older brother the MX Master 3S is getting all the attention, but it costs as much as THREE M720s and I\'m not paying $100 for a mouse this month. This has almost all the features for a much more reasonable price.Specifically, it is versatile. It can control up to three devices, by any mix of Bluetooth and ""wireless"" radio waves you choose. The Bluetooth is not ""laggy"" and doesn\'t take an extra click or two to wake up as so many do. There\'s a thumb switch with an indicator to switch among them. Works like a  charm. There\'s even special software that lets you move from one computer to the other just by swiping the mouse cursor all the way to the edge of the screen; it emerges on the other monitor. I don\'t use it because I have other commands that use the edges of my desktops. The scroll wheel ix adjustable. Please be right handed though.It\'s luxuriously ergonomic, fits a large hand like a glove. Lots of buttons, all programmable with Logitech\'s driver/utility that thus far is working better than their software used to run. Mouse is coated with a very thin nano or micro rubbery layer for a good grip. I use it for a mac, a pc, and an android phone, not a word of complaint. And when I have complaints about hardware or really anything, I\'m not shy about giving voice to them. Snazziest mouse I\'ve ever owned.

Just because I\'m on a PC doesn\'t mean I want a loud, clunky keyboard and carpel tunnel syndrome from working the thing. So if you like the feel and style of the apple keyboards, this is just the thing.You\'ll know from the imagery if the layout is for you. Do I miss the ""page up,"" ""page down,"" ""insert,"" etc. buttons? No, not enough to give up the smaller form factor. Am I bothered by the compact design of the arrow buttons? Not in the slightest; use that space up. If these things bother you, look elsewhere. Do I have a hard time finding the buttons? No. Would I use it for gaming? I\'m not much of a PC gamer, but, yes, I would. I like the keyboard; I\'ll use it for everything that requires a keyboard.Contrary to its intended design, I bought it to use with Windows 10, so I\'ll shed some light on how it performs there. There are a few idiosyncrasies, but overall, it suits my needs, so I\'m happy with it.Right out of the box, I plugged it into my PC and, to my surprise, it worked instantaneously. I guess I thought I might have to pair it over Bluetooth or download drivers. Nope. It just works. Of course, it does pair over Bluetooth without issue. (UPDATE: As per Satechi, connect through control panel if you have trouble with the standard Bluetooth menu.) Also to my surprise, the function keys seemed to carry some of their functionality over to Windows without any extra effort. For instance, the brightness and volume keys function smoothly. The buttons for the backlights work as well.The search key on F3 does not work, presumably because Windows doesn\'t have Mac\'s ""Spotlight"" search feature.I haven\'t tested the ""previous"" and ""next"" buttons on F7 and F9 respectively, but I can confirm that ""play"" on F8 does its job.You can lock the function keys to just plain old F1-F12, which is actually fantastic because then there isn\'t any overlap in functionality when using an application that utilizes those buttons. It\'s a welcome feature that I hadn\'t realized I needed. And it works exactly as intended on Windows.Apple keyboards like this one don\'t have the ""Windows"" button, which is, of course, a centerpiece of all PC keyboards. Here, the ""command"" key functions as the Windows button. And, if you\'re coming from Apple like me, the ""Control"" button essentially takes the place of ""command"" in all the usual apple shortcuts. Not a problem, really, and I\'m rapidly getting used to it despite my initial resistance. The rest of the modifier keys function as normal.The ""clear"" key, located on the number pad, is of great importance here. ""Clear"" actually functions as ""num lock,"" and the num lock has to be engaged in order to type the numbers on the number pad. Otherwise, Windows interprets them as a ""up"" (8), ""down"" (2), ""left"" (4), ""right"" (6), ""home"" (7""), ""end"" (1), ""page up"" (9), and ""page down"" (3). There isn\'t an LED indicator of the num lock\'s status, so you just have to make a mental note.The ""="" on the number pad doesn\'t do anything, irrespective of the num lock. And I have yet to find any functionality in the ""eject/usb"" key.I did spend a decent amount of time exploring the idea of remapping keys so that I wouldn\'t have any  quirks like the dead ""="" key, for instance, or so I could switch ctrl and cmd so that it would be more like working on a Mac. But it can get weird, and will often create a conflict. If you try to remap the search shortcut on F3, for example, Windows interprets that as a ""space"" button; remap it and now you have no space bar. There\'s only one ""space"" function to go around, it seems. But remember that that F3 search button does nothing on its own, so one would think you could assign it to something else without giving up a non-existent space button. If you\'re scratching your head a bit, then you\'re reliving my experience. In the end, I decided that it was best to do no remapping at all, and to let the keyboard do its thing. It did seem entirely feasible to remap F1-F12 in their standalone, locked state, however. But some of my apps use those buttons, so I keep them clear for that. If you\'re a tech wizard, you may have a remapping solution that solves every problem I\'ve mentioned. I knew nothing about keyboard remapping going into this, I feel like I learned a lot about it in the process, and yet I decided against it. For reference, I was using PowerToys, with a brief dabble in SharpKeys.At first, I had written off the ability to switch between multiple Bluetooth devices using the buttons in the top right. But once I had it connected, I thought, ""Why not connect it to my phone?"" One pairing later, and now I can use it to type on my phone by pushing one button. Then I thought, ""Why not connect it to my old iMac that\'s just sitting here waiting to be discarded?"" So I did. I can jump between all three devices with ease; the switch takes about a half a second. As someone who wasn\'t interested in the feature at first, I was sold on it in no time, and I can easily see myself taking advantage of it in the future.My only minor complaint is that it seems to take just a second too long to connect to my computer upon startup despite the fact that I keep it wired to the PC. I\'m ready to type in my password, and I tend to jump the gun just a little. I suspect, therefore, that the keyboard doesn\'t send the input signals over the cable. I would prefer it did, but I\'ll let it slide. By the same token, I can\'t seem to use it to enter my BIOS on startup because it presumably has not connected yet. My magic keyboard always seemed to connect to my iMac right away, so perhaps the responsibility for these minor connectivity quirks falls more squarely on the shoulders of my PC; who knows? (UPDATE: It does have a wired mode; press fn+eject to use it. But it still doesn\'t connect automatically on boot up. I\'m not sure if something changed, but what I actually have to do is boot the computer, unplug the keyboard, and plug it back in for it to be recognized on the wired connection. A hassle, but....)Other than that, it seems to be smooth sailing, and I\'m having a comfortable and efficient time gliding across this keyboard. I wasn\'t expecting it to be as compatible as it seems to be with Windows 10, and for that, I can safely say that it has exceeded my expectations. Make me a PC version and maybe I\'ll get that, but this will do just fine in the interim.', 'Really liked the look and features. The bluetooth connection worked immediately with two different macbooks from different generations (one with Ventura, one with Monterey), plus an iPhone. Switching between the devices was straightforward.Expecting however a feeling similar with that of the Apple magic keyboard I was a bit disappointed:- The keys have a slightly longer travel distance.- They have just a bit extra resistance to pressure than I would have expected.- Trying to save space, the keyboard feels a bit ""squeezed"".The quality however is evident, even if the keys feel a bit ""stiff"".I was also not super satisfied with the backlight of the keys, it felt it could not get bright enough.Overall: a solid choice unless you are super picky with your keyboard and the minor details I mentioned above can affect your work comfort (they can in my case).', 'This is a first-impressions review of the Satechi Slim X3 Bluetooth Backlit Keyboard.I have used every single Apple keyboard design since the original Macintosh in 1984. While some designs were pretty good and others more forgettable, Apple’s (wired) aluminum keyboard (shown in one of my photos) introduced in 2007, with its low height, thin profile, flat plane, square keys, gentle front-to-back slope, and minimal footprint has always been my favorite. Its design was a radical departure from the traditional dome-switch keys (tall, concave keys with a lot of travel) included in wired desktop keyboards of the era. Apple essentially took the chiclet-style keys found on MacBooks of the era, surrounded them with a flat plane of aluminum, and included it as a wired keyboard (including the arrow keys section and the numeric keypad) with desktop Macs. As a touch typist, I was reluctant at first to try the aluminum keyboard …\xa0but after 10 minutes of using one, I was immediately hooked, and it became my favorite Apple keyboard design. Burned by the lousy feel of the butterfly key mechanisms introduced in on the 2015 MacBook and 2016 MacBook Pros, I wasn’t willing to try the wireless Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad that replaced the wired keyboard in 2017 for desktop Macs —\xa0so I held onto Apple’s older wired aluminum keyboards for use with the several Macs that I use at home and work.In early 2021, when Satechi announced the new Slim X3 backlit keyboard (in both wired and wireless versions) with a design that appeared very similar to what I’ve considered Apple’s best wired keyboard —\xa0low height, thin profile, flat plane, square keys, gentle front-to-back slope, and minimal footprint, plus the bonus of backlighting —\xa0I was willing to give it a try. My early impressions of the tactile feel of the keyboard are very positive; to my fingers, the Satechi Slim X3 feels very comparable to Apple’s wired aluminum keyboard. Surprisingly, as you’ll see in a photo, keys in the main “qwerty” portion of the keyboard are just a tiny bit (perhaps only a couple of millimeters) wider than Apple’s, but the difference is so small that you won’t notice. Overall, the keyboard is actually narrower than Apple’s; Satechi has less separation between the “qwerty,” arrow keys, and numeric keypad portions of the keyboard.The front row of the Slim X3 is at roughly the same height as Apple’s front row. The back row of the Slim X3 is lower in height than Apple’s, but Satechi includes a pair of optional feet; if attached, the back row of the Slim X3 will be higher than Apple’s wired keyboard.The backlighting is a nice feature, and one not available at this writing in Apple’s Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad for Macs (as distinct from the Magic Keyboard for iPad or the Magic Keyboard built into MacBooks, which do have backlighting). The backlighting in Satechi’s Slim X3 is almost too effective in that the light leaks from the front and side edges of the keycaps, especially in the row of function keys when viewed from a normal typing angle. (Backlighting on my 2018 MacBook Air and on my Magic Keyboard for iPad both seem to be more contained.) But if Satechi’s keycap design is perhaps less refined than Apple’s in terms of backlighting, it doesn’t bother me —\xa0and, of course, the backlighting can be dialed down or turned off.Even though I’m a fan of wired keyboards for use with desktop Macs, I chose the Bluetooth version of the Slim X3 because the wired version has a USB-C connection and I will be using the Slim X3 for the time being with an older iMac that has only USB-A jacks. But I can confirm that pairing the Slim X3 via Bluetooth with a 2012-model iMac was flawless. Because the Slim X3 Bluetooth Backlit Keyboard can also be simultaneously paired with as many as four computers, I also paired it with a 2016 MacBook Pro. Switching between computers, using the function-row Bluetooth 1, 2, 3, and 4 keys at the top of the numeric keypad, works just fine and is quick.Because this is merely a first-impressions review, I can’t speak to the Slim X3 keyboard’s battery life; in fact, it came at least partially charged and I haven’t even charged it yet! If my impressions about durability or anything else are negative after a few months of use, I’ll come back to update this review. But initial impressions of the Satechi Slim X3 Bluetooth Backlit Keyboard are very positive. I’m glad to recommend this product.UPDATE (10 days): Adjusting to this keyboard took no time at all. Although keystrokes feel ever-so-subtly different from Apple\'s wired aluminum keyboard, the difference hasn\'t slowed me down. On rare occasions (maybe once or twice a day), keystrokes result in repeated letters on-screen (such as ""mm"" instead of ""m""); I think it\'s this Satechi keyboard rather than my fingers since I didn\'t experience this with Apple\'s wired keyboard, but it doesn\'t happen often enough for me to be bothered or to reduce my rating.UPDATE (7 months): I continue to be impressed with the feel of this keyboard … but the issue of repeated keystrokes (such as ""bb"" instead of ""b"") happens often enough (a couple times daily, perhaps as often as once per hour, on random keys so I don\'t think it\'s a manufacturing defect on one or more keys) that I\'ve lowered my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars. Given that this issue doesn\'t occur with Apple\'s old wired aluminum keyboard (and I use one of those almost daily on three other Macs), I\'m inclined to think that it\'s a minor design flaw in Satechi\'s product. Going forward, I will try to pay more attention to which keys see occasional repeats —\xa0to confirm my theory that this is a minor design flaw rather than a defect with specific keys on my Satechi Slim X3.', 'Windows11で利用していますが、特に問題ありません。複数台の利用もOK。元々、ThinkPadトラックポイントキーボードを利用していましたが、サイズ感、質感、重量感も良く気に入りました。一点、ThinkPadキーボードと比較して、Enterキーが小さいので打ち間違いをしますが、慣れの問題と思います。', 'Volevo una tastiera piccola, grigio siderale, design pulito e minimale… allora mi son detto Apple Magic K?

I've mainly used the Logitech G440 and the Roccat Alumic (which has an aluminum core). I loved both but they wore out over time, both visually and from a texture degradation perspective. I then switched to the Corsair MM150, which has a nice texture but just isn't big enough, and I found myself running my mouse completely off the pad during intense gaming moments where I needed the space to hit flicks and 180 turns (typically when getting surprised from behind or when fighting multiple attackers).Enter the SkyPAD 3.0. As far as I'm concerned, the SkyPAD is the KING OF THE HARD PADS. I've had mine since the end of May, so a little over 90 days. I'm using it with a Corsair Sabre RGB Pro with aftermarket PTFE feet from Corepad. Here are my keytakeaways:1. The glide and smoothness of this pad is unmatched. It FEELS AMAZING. I'm also using a 240hz display and the sense of mouse tracking I get feels so pristine it's hard to really put into words.2. This pad will punish your mistakes hard; BUT, it's not the pad's fault, it's yours. I play on a higher mouse sense than most people do and I had to lower my in-game sense about 10-20% on a few games because I was overshooting.3. Over time your muscle memory will adapt to the smoothness of the pad, and the sense of control you get is worth it. I do still have to remind myself occasionally to calm down so that my fine motor control doesn't crater to the point that the pad becomes an obstacle, but this has actually made me a better player as a result. Other pads with more drag act a crutch for panicking players who lose the ability to make fine adjustments. I have panicked several times while using this pad and paid the price. But the comforting thing at the end of the day was that I knew it was me at fault and not the pad. Now when I encounter situations where I have to clutch up, I'm much calmer through repeated practice and, as a result, much deadlier.4. This pad is great for fingertip grippers. The fingertip grip has always prioritized finesse and little movements. This means that the less friction you encounter, the easier the mouse moves and the more precision you can obtain. For how I've been playing FPS games for decades, this pad is a godsend. The force you apply with your fingers is purely directed toward moving the weight of the mouse and NOT overcoming the friction of the pad. The muscle memory you can ingrain into fine movements over time is awesome.5. This pad (the XL 3.0) is big. I've never run out of room on it, and, as a result, my formerly ever-present paranoia that I'm going to run off the pad, which previous pads instilled into me, is gone. It might seem like a little thing, but it means that if I need to sweep the mouse large distances, I have the confidence to take the action without any hesitation that I'll run out of space.ON CLEANING: Yes, the pad's performance will degrade greatly as dust particles, hair, fuzz, lint, or grime build up on it. It usually takes a couple weeks for this to build up to any noticeable degree, although I take great care to not get any food crumbs on the pad when I eat at my desk. A food crumb or a grain of salt will absolutely destroy your ability to use this pad. But the good news is that it's pretty obvious when your tracking is being obstructed by something, and cleaning the pad is easy. SkyPAD does offer their own proprietary cleaning product on their website, but I've been using Endust with a microfiber cloth and cleaning is done within a minute or two, and tracking is back to how it was on day one. It is also important to make sure to clean the bottom of your mouse, as significant buildup of lint or little hairs can also snag the pad and interfere with tracking.FInal comment on build quality, the arm sleeve question, and price: This pad is solid and quite heavy. It's very sturdy and doesn't flex. It has 4 feet on the bottom of the pad that grip well onto my wood desk. It absolutely does not move or slide unless I physically pick it up.I bought the black version of the pad, and the surface itself is quite beautiful under direct light. If you take a flashlight or a lamp up to the glass finish, you can see a brilliantly shimmering texture. SpyPAD's product page says that they use a special lace pattern on the glass, and it's visible up-close. When I first contemplated buying this pad, I was wondering what the glass would be like. Would it just be like putting my mouse on a window pane? Short answer: no. This doesn't feel or look like normal glass. It feels cool to the touch and the surface has been finished in a very specific way so as to make it incredibly smooth.I've seen some reviewers comment that they need an arm sleeve to use this pad adequately. This doesn't jive with my experience, but I play in a cool room with a fan blowing directly on me. You MIGHT need a sleeve if you play in a hot environment as moisture on the pad from sweat will cause minor interference to glide. But if you aren't sweating, you should be fine. The skin from your hand or wrist touching the pad should not in itself cause any sort of issue.Finally, the price - Yes, it's high for a mouse pad. The final decision is up to you. But you should consider what you're getting here. If you already use hardpads and you can spare the cash, you should absolutely get the SkyPAD as it's going to last you potentially forever. Already in my 90 days with it I've absent-mindedly tossed my car keys on it, nudged the edges of it with my keyboard, and sat my phone on it, but nothing has resulted in it being scratched or dinged, so it seems very durable to me. And the precision control you get (at least when using a mouse with PTFE feet) is just awesome, and the buttery glide never gets old. The way I looked at it, this pad was an investment so that I'd never need another mousepad again, and so far, things have turned out that way. If there's ever a SkyPAD 4.0, then I'll give it a look, but for now, with the 3.0, I'm golden. This is a great product."", 'I have been using the SkyPAD glass 3.0 gaming mouse pad now for 7 weeks since delivery, so I thought it’s time to put in the review.I have a slight niggle with Amazon to start with, I ordered the SkyPad to be delivered in an Amazon box because the Pad is “glass” to give it a bit more protection but in arrived in its own SkyPad box only. Now on this point, the inside of the SkyPad box hasn’t got that much protection and could have easily got broken but alas I got lucky and it wasn’t. This is just something to note if you are ordering it.The SkyPad itself,Before buying the SkyPad, I was always using XL cloth mouse mats and without doubt they slow the mouse down when putting the slightest bit of pressure down on them as you digging the mouse into the mat, Any Esports gamer will tell you this.Now the SkyPad is a different kettle of fish altogether, its glass and man is it slippery. You will notice the difference straight off the bat and think it is the best thing since sliced bread. It also has its drawbacks as well.Good Pointsit’s heavy and will not move.It’s very fast with the mouse. “Mouse glides effortlessly”Easy to clean.Bad pointsThe Price “at £76 (17/08/23) it is expensive but RGB cloth mouse mats are over £100 now”.Cleaning, you will have to clean it because of body oils, smudges, finger prints at least every 2 days.ConclusionIs it better than a cloth mouse mat? And the answer is “without doubt”Is it worth it, in my opinion, yesTip on cleaningI used a wet wipe to first clean the pad, then I use Mr Sheen Polish to put a nice slippery surface on it.Hope the review helps in whatever you decide to do.', 'Jahrelang war ich auf der Suche nach der idealen Gaming-Maus, aber ich habe nie darüber nachgedacht, dass auch das Mauspad eine entscheidende Rolle spielen könnte.

Es macht viel Freude damit zu Zocken.Von der Haltbarkeit wird es wohl das letzte sein das man kauft,wenn man nicht all zu unvorsichtig damit umgeht :)Natürlich hat es seinen Preis,und ist alles andere als Günstig,aber in meinen Augen ist es das auch Wert.Für mich eine Klare Kaufempfehlung !', 'Ich schreibe wenige Rezessionen, aber hier fühle ich mich wieder genötigt....

Endlich das Pad gefunden, was ich gesucht habe. Ich überlege schon, mir eines auf Reserve zu holen.', ""I wasn't too impressed on the first couple of days, but once I got used to it, its quite nice. I would say that this is worth it only if you have a very light mouse (<60 grams), as stopping the mouse accurately is still effortless at lighter weights (its not plain smooth glass, theres a microscopic satin finish on the surface, it kind of lightly sparkles in light like quality car paint does) - but the low friction does become an issue for heavier ones. The cost of the pad is still on the pricier side, so considering the increased wear on PTFE mouse feet, I'd only consider it cost effective it if you can swap out your mice feet to something durable like polished ceramic (eg. a Glorious mouse). I previously had an Endgame cordura pad which is pretty good, but the glass pad is definitely on a whole other level for glide and ease of moving the mouse around. My previous Endgame pad was also very easy to keep clean compared to a cloth pad (I often eat at my desk and its still very clean after 2 years), but with this glass pad you barely need to try to keep it clean. Dust? Hair? Cat fur? Just swipe your hand over it, spotless in 1 second. Spills? Just wipe it with a cloth, done.The only unavoidable downside IMO is that at nighttime when its super quiet, you will definitely notice the sound of the mouse moving on the pad when you flick it quickly (not an issue if you move it slowly or at daytime with ambient noise), more so than you would with a cordura or cloth pad."", ""Amazing mouse pad upgrading from a worn out teflon coated aluminum hard pad. The texture is pleasant, my mouse glides maybe a little too much, and my aim is notably improved in games. Overall i love it!But its not perfect.1: i wish the logo wasn't some garish gamer thing. I do a lot more than just game on my PC. But i knew this going in.2: i hate the sound it makes. My mouse is silent on my old pad and desk but makes this rubbing sound on this. I have added a thin sheet of foam under which softens its sound but it would be way nicer if it didn't make this sound.In the end, i like the texture and performance too much to give it up and will be keeping it."", ""Si vous avez une souris laser a fort DPI et que  vous aimez que ça glisse sans aucune sensation d'aspérité, alors c'est tout simplement le meilleur tapis sur le marché.De plus le tapis de verre sombre a un certain style et ne tache pas comme mon ancien tapis tissus."", ""J'ai eu différents tapis de souris au cours des 5 dernières années, plus de 15 à 20 d'entre eux de la sorcière 7 ont été des tapis durs, quand j'ai vu le prix de 129 sur celui-ci, j'étais très inquiet et si ce n'était pas bon, je l'aurais instantanément Je l'ai retourné.

I had resorted on buying the generic nibs but those started snapping in the S-Pen. The only way of removing them was heating up a needle (red hot) and sticking it into the s-pen to remove the broke nib. This would damage the S-pen. So I bought some replacement S-pens. The replacements were the same as the original but the nibs were still the cheap ones. I felt like it was hopeless & that I was out of options. Then I found a Reddit forum that said you just need a stylus with EMR tech and they recommended the Wacom One Stylus. I was skeptical if it would work on my Galaxy Tab S3 (we're currently on S9). I looked into it a little more and went to artists' reviews & found a few where they specifically used it with the S3. I decided to order it. Just tested it out and its just like the S-pen. It takes some adjustments because of the grip and the nibs difference. I have a Wacom Intuos tablet so it was just minor readjusting in my case to something I my muscles could remember. For people new to Wacom, you might need to take a day or 2 to do so. The nib texture will feel different too. The S-pen nibs have a softer, more gripped feeling because the nibs are made with some rubbery material in them. This gives more smooth friction to your stroke when using the S-pen. An artist did mention this in his review & I do see it. It's something I can adjust to, I think, and I feel it might be a good thing for my stroke style. I have a tempered glass screen so the Wacom nib slides with little to almost no friction. If you want some sort of friction texture, a matte screen protector might help. My Wacom Intuos tablet has that matte surface texture that provides the friction some folks prefer. I am satisfied with my product as of its first day though. This really does work with all Samsung S tablets & I will be happy to use it in the future too.Maybe a caveat would be that it's pretty hard to find a compact case to store the stylus with the tablet. Like the S-pens are magnetic or there are cases with stylus slots. This is a little big so it would be good to have a pen case that can strap onto the Samsung tablet case cover or there being a case for the S-tablet with a pen slot that can fit the Wacom One Stylus. Or something magnetic like in the S-pen that helps it latch onto the tablet.2 month Update:I've really gotten used to the Wacom One. I've been using my tablet every day for taking notes in class & doing homework. My teacher thinks its a pretty cool stylus too. I was able to fit it into a S-pen stylus case that straps onto the tablet cover. I'm still slightly traumatized from the S-pen nibs that would randomly break, however this nib for the Wacom One doesn't show any indications of material weakness. Sometimes I'm unconsciously putting pressure on the pen but this pen handles that. It's also been very good with drawing too. It's given my tablet a longer lifespan. It feels really good, even on the smooth screen. I even saw some screen protectors that were meant to have that paper feel. Its just the matter of finding one for your device. Now I can sit next to the iPad users with their Apple Pencils & my Stylus looks really cool."", ', I have gone through the Samsung Galaxy stylus rollercoaster (1.  cool!; 2. Oh no it broke; 3. Buy a brand new pen; 4. Replace multiple non samsung tips; and loop this )Since Samsung Galaxy uses Wacom tables/stylus technology you can use this pen.  The tip lasts FOREVER,i cant remember how many tips i replaced!!  It also has decent pressure readings if you are an artist or graphic designer.  I paint/draw digitally and using this tablet with this stylus is a great way to cheaply get digital art gear.  It is a very low cost, high value solution.You miss out on a few small features like having it charge magnetically, and it does have a button to use but I dont believe it goes as far as Samsung on this feature.  For me it is perfect.', ""The nib of my s pen broke inside the pen itself after only two months of using it and i bought this as a replacement since it's compatible with my tablet.I honestly initially expected the stylus to be a tad bit longer and bigger but that's on me for not checking its size, it really isn't that long and is almost the exact length as my hand. I'd say it's the average size of a regular pen, maybe a bit longer? It's the exact same length as the s pen. Either way it fits right into my hand and the grip is quite comfy for me to draw, which is why I bought it to begin with.The nibs are a harder plastic, whereas the s pen that came with my tab had this brush-like flimsy tip, it felt a bit strange fo use at first but it grew on me, the s pen allows for more precise lines and has more friction when you drag it across the screen. The wacom one pen feels lighter (?) to use since there's less friction, I honestly enjoy the feel of it and sketching is leagues more enjoyable than the experience i had with the s pen, and it definitely isn't too harsh on my screen or anything, but it’s honestly a matter of preference + the screen protector you use could effect the drawing experience.The only thing that's been bothering is the button, the placement feels a bit awkward to me, and it's juuuust a bit hard to press, other than that I haven't faced any negatives with this stylus.As for the performance of the pen, it absolutely works wonders. I mean it uses the exact same emr tech as the s pen so if you're worried about the performance downgrading then rest assured that it'll never happen.Do note that the responsiveness of your device could deffffinitely effect the accuracy and performance of the pen (I've tried it on a 15 year old touch screen hp computer just for the sake of it lol, and it worked normally but much slower and laggier than on my tablet) so keep that in mind.Bought an extra pack of nibs just in case, but the pen itself comes with 3 free nibs."", 'The pen is fairly ergonomic and seems to be made out of fairly durable plastic. Compatible with Samsung Tab S8+ without any issues. For the price I can clearly recommend the pen all tough a second button and a erase function when turn the pen would have been nice.', ""My original pen was chewed up by my dog and I was frantic to get a painting completed, so I needed a pen with a fine tip and pressure sensitivity. This pen works great with my tablet and I daresay I enjoy it more than the stock S7 pen. I will say, it provides a more sensitive experience than the stock pen, in that I don't apply really any pressure at all for finer lines and if I do, they come out much thicker, but it's only a slight adjustment. The pen size is also much better in that my hand is not cramping as much. The tip that comes with the pen is definitely more durable than the standard tips with the stock pen. I use a paperlike screen protector so the nibs tend to wear quickly but I dont get that impression from the plastic ones that come with this pen as they are much thicker. That said, I have opted for a metal tip altogether. Overall, very pleased with this pen and the speed of delivery."", ""The increased size from a standard Samsung stylus is more comfortable for me. I tend to hold my pens a little too tight and I'm afraid I'll bend or break it sometimes. The pen tip doesn't have the drag of a felt tipped stylus, but in a more controlled writing position I didn't have any slipping issues with my glass screen protector on my S6 Lite.  I'm hoping this helps loosen up my drawing arm as well since the pen can't slow me down as much."", 'Better than S pen with not so soft tip and not hard on screen either for writing and drawing, but for other spen functions not so much .', 'Mi spen se descompuso y el wacom one pen me sirvió perfecto.', ""I have an older Samsung tab S4, and had lost my Pen.  Decided to order this replacement and the Wacom one Pen works even better than the stock Samsung pen my tablet came with.  It's quicker, and less laggy, I like how the buttons on this is slightly raised so I always know where they are and don't accidently push it when I lose my finger placement.I am not giving 5 stars because of its' contour feature, it doesn't allow it to sit inside the pen holder on my tablet, so i have to be careful and be mindful of where I leave it."", ""The Wacom One Pen is a fantastic addition to any digital artist or graphic designer's toolkit. This pen stylus offers a responsive and precise drawing experience, making it easy to create intricate designs and artwork with incredible accuracy. It's compatible with various Wacom devices, ensuring that you can seamlessly transition between different creative tools. The pressure sensitivity of the pen is a standout feature, allowing for natural and nuanced line thickness variations, making it feel like you're using a traditional pen or brush. Whether you're sketching, illustrating, or retouching photos, the Wacom One Pen's performance is reliable and enhances the overall creative process.Furthermore, the Wacom One Pen is designed with comfort in mind. Its ergonomic shape ensures a comfortable grip, even during extended periods of use. The pen is lightweight, making it easy to control and minimizing hand fatigue. It doesn't require batteries, eliminating the hassle of constant replacements. With the Wacom One Pen, you can enjoy a seamless and intuitive digital drawing experience, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced digital artists alike.""]"

Se avete problemi al polso quando usate il mouse, probabilmente questa è la soluzione che state cercando. Se ancora non ne avete, è un ottimo investimento per prevenire futuri problemi!Faccio questa recensione dopo 1 mese di utilizzo quotidiano (8/10 ore in media se non di più): di seguito quella completa, a fine recensione invece il riepilogo con PRO e CONTRO. Spero che possa tornarvi utile a prendere una decisione se acquistare o meno questo mouse verticale Logitech :)  -------------- RECENSIONE COMPLETA ----------------Lavoro come Freelancer e studio sceneggiatura: in pratica 8-10 ore al PC ogni giorno non me le toglie nessuno, che sia per lavoro o sia per scrivere. Ormai era da mesi che avevo problemi al polso: mi dava fastidio l\'uso del trackpad del mio MacBook Pro, e anche usare un ""classico"" mouse orizzontale non mi permetteva di lavorare in tranquillità.Insomma, i fastidi al polso erano dietro l\'angolo quasi ogni giorno. E ciò incideva ovviamente sulla mia produttività personale. Ho speso così giorni e giorni alla ricerca di una soluzione, addentrandomi nel favoloso (ma spesso complicato) mondo dell\'ergonomia e tra tutte le recensioni/video/siti che ho usato per informarmi, la risposta sembrava unanime: il Mouse Verticale è la migliore opzione sul mercato per cercare di mantenere il polso in una posizione neutra durante l\'uso al PC.So che esiste anche l\'alternativa del mouse con trackball, ma ho letto recensioni contrastanti (così come pareri di esperti): l\'uso della rotella per muovere il puntatore potrebbe sottoporre il pollice ad un eccessivo sforzo quotidiano. Così ho optato per il mouse verticale della Logitech, una marca di cui già avevo altri prodotti e mi ha sempre soddisfatto. Tra l\'altro, l\'ho preso pagando sui 75 EUR qua da Amazon, quando sul sito ufficiale Logitech viene venduto sui 115 EUR.Pensavo ci volesse un po\' di tempo per adattarsi alla nuova postura e che quindi magari nei primi giorni sarei stato più ""lento"" nel normale utilizzo del computer e invece, a mia sorpresa, ci ho messo solo pochi secondi ad adattarmi. L\'impugnatura è così naturale, non dà fastidi, e non ho riscontrato nessuna difficoltà nell\'utilizzo (lo specifico perché ho letto di recensioni dove ci si lamentava sulla precisione che si ha usando un mouse verticale, ma personalmente non ho riscontrato problemi di questo genere per l\'utilizzo che ne faccio io).Comodissimi anche i due tasti configurabili che ci sono su un lato del Mouse: usando l\'app della Logitech dal vostro PC o Mac, potrete assegnare due differenti azioni a questi tasti (sul mio Macbook Pro ho messo lo spostamento da una Schermata all\'altra, così da non dover usare più il trackpad).L\'unica mancanza a mio avviso, già segnalata giustamente in altre recensioni, è l\'infinite scroll per la rotellina del mouse: in effetti, se avete a che fare con documenti molto lunghi, usare solo la rotellina per spostarsi può diventare una scocciatura (ma non è un dramma: alla fine si può usare pure la classica barra di scroll che appare sui documenti o sulle pagine web, e in tal caso basta un click).Potrete collegare questo Mouse Verticale direttamente tramite cavo oppure Bluetooth (inserendo l\'apposito adattatore nel vostro PC o Mac - in caso di dispositivi Apple recenti, vi servirà un adattatore da USB-C // USB in entrambi i casi). Quando metterete il mouse in ricarica tramite il cavo, un comodo LED sul fianco del mouse lampeggerà per segnalarlo (Logitech afferma che una ricarica completa equivale a circa 4 mesi di utilizzo - su questo aspetto non ne ho idea, visto che uso sempre il mouse collegato via cavo).Uso il mouse su una classica scrivania in legno e fila liscio come l\'olio. Ho letto in altre recensioni però che se pianificate di usarlo su superfici lucide, allora avrete bisogno di un tappetino per avere un corretto funzionamento. Concludendo, è possibile modificare il grado di precisione/sensibilità del mouse verticale cliccando su un tasto del mouse: vi si aprirà una schermata sul PC/Mac e da lì potrete configurare il tutto (sinceramente non ne ho avuto bisogno, almeno per me già la configurazione base andava benissimo).  ----------------------- CONCLUSIONE ------------------------Per fare un riepilogo, dopo 1 mese di utilizzo quotidiano, stra-consiglio l\'acquisto di un Mouse Verticale a chiunque lavori o studi da PC o Mac quotidianamente. Diventa un vero salvavita (e polso): è vero che il Mouse Verticale Logitech costa di più rispetto ad un classico mouse oppure ad un mouse verticale di una qualche marca sconosciuta, ma alla fine state investendo sulla vostra salute e anche sulla vostra produttività.Aggiungo anche che a volte mi ritrovo ad usare il mouse verticale per sessioni di gaming con amici (uso il servizio di cloud gaming di Nvidia sul Macbook) e nonostante il mouse verticale non sia consigliato per giocare, devo ammettere di trovarmici bene. Ovvio, non faccio competizioni/tornei o roba competitiva, gioco solo per divertirmi e passare il tempo, e in questo tipo di utilizzo mi trovo molto bene con il mouse verticale.PRO- Addio fastidi e problemi al polso fin dai primi utilizzi- Permette di mantenere una posizione neutra al vostro polso durante l\'uso- Tempo di adattamento pressoché nullo: dipende da persona a persona, ma nel mio caso non ho notato differenze nella mia produttività dal cambio di mouse- Mouse leggero e con materiali buoni, anche il grip (ovvero la presa) è piacevole- Presenza di due tasti configurabili con qualsiasi comando vogliate tramite l\'app di Logitech dal vostro PC/Mac- Possibilità di collegare mouse con cavo USB oppure Adattatore Bluetooth- Rapporto qualità/prezzo davvero ottimo- Possibilità di modificare la sensibilità/precisione del mouse con un semplice tasto presente sul mouse stessoCONTRO- Mancanza dell\'Infinite Scroll per la rotellina del mouse (potrebbe rivelarsi un problema se di lavoro dovete leggervi decine e decine di documenti lunghi ogni giorno), ma è una cosa molto soggettiva- Chiaramente non è un mouse da gaming competitivo, anche se potreste trovarvi bene lo stesso ad utilizzarlo per giocare normalmente- Se pianificate di usare il mouse su una superficie lucida, avrete bisogno di un tappetino per mouse', ""I have/own many logitech mice and they have been my preferred brand for a long time now.  I love my MX Master2 mouse but.... I have been an engineer of some sort or another all my career and it has taken its toll on my wrists.  I'm not capable of more than an hour or so using a standard mouse without my wrist getting very painful.  So I looked into ergonomic mice and being a logitech fan, I found  the MX vertical. Not the cheapest option out there but I am glad I have it.  Initially I thought it wasn't helping as my wrist still hurt but after a couple of sessions,  I  now don't feel any discomfort at all even after a few hours!  Also its worth noting that it may take a bit of time to get used to the new hand position (even if you don't have dodgy wrists) but it has become very natural to me. I now use no other mouse; even for gaming!"", ""I bought this as I use a computer daily and it was aggravating my golfer elbow, a standard mouse was just making the pain a little worse every day. Due the the nature of my work, I couldn't just stop and rest for 2-3 weeks. So I looked for solutions, saw this and thought yes! IT WORKS REALLY WELL. It worked over time, elbow pain got better every day not worse, and I didn't have to stop working at the computer.For people worried about the odd way of using a mouse (having use normal mice for 20+ years I was worried), it's not a big deal, takes about 2-3 days and your 85% as good as you were before, now Im 100% as capable with this as I was.For people with large homer simpson hands, this particular mouse is OK, your pinky takes the weight which can be tiring over a long day.Can you game with this mouse, if you don't suffer from wireless latency in your games, the answer is yes its fine.The only niggle is the pathetic wireless, put a cup of coffee in line of sight, or even a photo-frame and you get all sorts of issues. Took me a while to work out that it was the wireless, thought it was software. Anyway I plugged it in to charge the device and you can still use the mouse with a charging wire connected, and all the issues disappeared, so I got a usb-a extended cable from back of PC so the mouse dongle is now a foot away from the mouse, problems solved. Hope that helps anyone else who has a PC that's out of sight."", ""I love this thing.I don't know how people can use a conventional mouse.  After 30 minutes of a regular mouse my wrist starts to hurt and I usually power through the pain, knowing it's not good for me.Since I've been using this mouse, I can work for hours straight with no wrist pain (to the benefit of my employer).Be aware that it's only for one hand, so no switching from left to right, which is a slight pitfall in my opinion.Guess I'll just have to get two *shrugs*.I've recommended and even gifted this mouse to friends and family who've gone on to do the same.Never really used it for gaming, but I assume it will do just fine.It come with an optional software so you can dedicate buttons to certain actions, which is really useful for a smooth workflow."", ""Scrivo questa recensione dopo tre mesi circa di utilizzo e lo trovo fantastico.L'ho acquistato in quanto avevo da tempo fastidi ai muscoli del polso e ora sono risolti, a questo punto posso dire che la causa era l'utilizzo prolungato di un mouse tradizionale.Per mani medio grandi è il top, la batteria dopo 3 mesi è al 50% di carica, e scaricando dal sito logitech l'apposita app è possibile configurare tutto (tasti, rotella ecc ecc).Costa parecchio ma è un prodotto di fascia alta, la qualità costruttiva è ottima come lo sono i materiali.Lo consiglio."", ""Très bon produit. Je n'ai mis que trois étoiles pour l'ergonomie, non pas qu'il soit mal étudié mais la souris est très grosse. J'ai de grandes mains (taille de gants XL ou XXL) pourtant je la trouve limite trop grosse. Sinon la qualité, ben c'est du Logitech donc excellent."", ""I'm a big fan of vertical mice. Since I started using them around 5 years ago I can't go back to normal mice anymore. And this is a really great mouse with fantastic performance and features compared to others. If you have a multi-device setup, say a Windows PC alongside a MacBook, the ability to seamlessly move your mouse from PC to MacBook by just dragging it off the screen feels like magic. You can even copy and paste stuff between devices... or was that a feature of the Logitech keyboard? In any case, it's all under the same ecosystem and I can attest to those features working really well.However, despite how much I wanted to like this mouse for all of that, it's unfortuantely not as comfortable as my Anker vertical mouse. This mouse is a bit too bulky and heavy, and it's shape makes it not as nice to use. Comfort is really important to me as I use a mouse for multiple hours every day and so that made this mouse a no-go in the end."", ""excellent produit . Très agréable à utiliser au quotient. Par contre, vraiment dommage qu' il n y ait pas une petite trappe pour insérer le petit connecteur usb dans la souris. Dans mon usage quotidien je suis amené à changer d endroit pour travailler et d ordinateur. Venant de ce fabriquant très fiable et au regard du prix c est très étonnant qu'il n est pas pensé à ajouter une trappe pour ce petit connecteur usb car on peut facilement le perdre en usage nomade. C est pour cette raison qu' il perd une étoile dans ma notation générale ."", 'Ich habe mich von meinen Arbeitskollegen dazu überreden lassen, mir auch eine ergonomische Maus anzuschaffen. Als Software-Ingenieur sitze ich ca. 8-10 Stunden am Tag am PC und benutze eine Maus, da dachte ich mir, dass es sicher nicht verkehrt ist, auf eine ergonomische Variante umzusteigen und damit die Hand etwas zu entlasten.Am Anfang bin ich mit der Maus nicht so gut zurechtgekommen, ich fand es komisch die Maus mit so einer Handhaltung zu bewegen und konnte auch keine Entlastung der Hand feststellen. Man hat mir aber gesagt, ich solle es trotzdem ein paar Tage ausprobieren und das habe ich dann auch gemacht. Als ich dann nach ca. 3-4 Tagen wieder zu meiner normalen Maus zurückkehrte und diese etwas länger als nur ein paar Sekunden benutzte, merkte ich den Unterschied und wie viel komfortabler und entspannter die MX Vertical im Vergleich zu meiner MX Master 3 doch ist.Mittlerweile liebe ich diese Maus und kann mir einen Arbeitstag ohne die MX Vertical kaum noch vorstellen. Auch außerhalb der Arbeit, wenn ich privat etwas am PC mache, benutze ich meistens diese Maus. Nur beim Gaming muss sie dann weichen. Von mir gibt es eine klare Kaufempfehlung.', 'Je suis très satisfait de ce produit MX vertical.Les points positifs :- La conception est de bonne facture, le produit est léger, très ergonomique,- Facile à utiliser ,on s\'adapte très rapidement à la prise en main)- La souris est précise, les boutons personnalisables.- Surtout, si vous avez des douleurs au poignet et à l\'avant bras, n\'hésitez pas, en quelques jours mes douleurs qui duraient depuis des mois ont disparues.Seuls points négatifs :- Il manque une molette horizontale pour un déplacement plus fluide sans utiliser les barres de défilement- La molette verticale n\'est pas ""hyperscroll"", je préfère utiliser les barres de défilement que de scroller- Les boutons, bien que pas très bruyants, ne sont pas silencieux.En bref, un très bon produit, qui pourrait être mis à jour avec des spécificités plus abouties. L\'ergonomie est vraiment son plus gros point fort, surtout si vous avez des douleurs au poignet et au bras.']"

Rubberised grip and heavy duty. Easy connectivity and beautiful colour.', ""Pros:The mouse has a good weight and balance to it, with more weight towards the rear end of it.The click is very soft and travel is shallow - makes it very fast to click, and less annoying.The shape of the mouse lends it comfortable for a fingertip grip. Due to the contours on the side, the placement of the thumb and ring fingers is perfect. And due to good weight balance, the pressure on the thumb and ring fingers is very low.Build quality is very good. Good quality rubber and plastic is used. Rubber is not too soft yet not excessively firm. It just feels right.Cons:Because of the shallow travel of the click, palm grip users may find that they make a lot of accidental clicks just by resting the finger on the button.The scroll wheel is not very tactile, although acceptable for general use.The mouse is a little heavy for continuous gaming use. If it were lighter by 10 grams, it would be perfect. However, also note that the weight is perfect for CAD and CAE. For the average user it is a good balance.The mouse feet seems to be of slightly low quality. I would recommended using the mouse on a mouse pad.Gaming usage:The mouse is very accurate considering the price. Slightly heavy for continuous gaming usage. However, the click is just better than perfect for quick FPS shots. Shallow travel and silent operation means tactile feedback is not perfect. On the brighter side, weight balance is on spot, movement is effortless and quick, it is comfortable to hold and somehow just feels right in your hand. Would I recommend it for serious gamers? No, look for something lighter. This mouse is great for casual and light gamers.Conclusion:At this price, it is a very good deal. Recommended for balanced gaming and general usage. Good for fingertip grip users - palm grip/claw grip users should look for something else. It is particularly unsuitable for claw grip.  For reference, my hands are slightly below average size with a length of about 7.2 inches. Possibly the best mouse in this budget for CAD/CAE applications. I'm gonna be asking my workplace to allow me to take this to work once WFH period is over."", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0It automatically started navigating and when i leave the mouse it’s vibrate on screen']"

The keys are just like a laptop\'s although not as quiet as I would\'ve wanted them to be. They sound like a mechanical keyboard which is not something I particularly enjoy. If you don\'t mind the extra noise have at it. However, because I bought the keyboard for its scissor switch keys due to pain a mechanical keyboard was causing on my knuckles, I\'ll have to deal with the sound until I can find a cover mat for it to silence the keys while I type. The keyboard has some weight to it so it\'s not just flying around everywhere, but it\'s not heavy either, perfect for taking it on the go. My keyboard did come with some of the function keys backwards. So, the ""Full screen"" button (activated by FN+F11) activates what should activate the ""Save as"" button (activated by FN+F12), and the ""Save as"" button doesn\'t do anything. I\'m not really sure if that\'s a defect of my keyboard or a laptop thing but be mindful of this. The rest of the keys hold true to their functions.As far as the mouse, it\'s fairly simple in design. From the pictures it looked like the edges were a sightly lighter grey, similar to the keyboard, but it\'s completely black. I do however love how smooth the wheel on it is and I can barely hear it when I click either button. There\'s no squeaky sound coming from the wheel when you scroll either so that a super plus in my book. The power button on the mouse if a little funny in a way that they off positions is right in between both bluetooth and USB on positions, but the space between them, you don\'t know if you turned it off or kept it on.Battery life: I\'d had to try it out on a full shift and see how long it lasts. It did come with some battery out the box, but I still charged both of them just in case. The instructions don\'t specify when the devices are charged completely, but after a couple hours the mouse light turned green, so I can asume that means its\'s charged up.Update on 04/04/2023; battery life has lasted this long without charging... not once since 02/27/2023! that\'s 36 entire days of using 5 days a week for 8+ hr. shifts each day! frankly I decided to charge them today just because I wanted to, not because I needed to. I can assume it could\'ve gone another month without a charge.Both the mouse and the keyboard have an almost seamless reaction when using the dongle, so it feels like there\'s an invisible wire connecting all 3 devices. I do wish it came with either 2 cables for recharging each device, or a dual cable/1 USB conector. This way if both of them need to charge up I can do so without any issues or worries that the second device would run out of battery before its\'s donde charging the first one.Overall, I feel that for the price, this is a great set. It\'s conveniente, its beautiful to look at, functional, rechargeable making it user and eco-friendly (no more stupid batteries dying after 2-3 months of constant use). If your looking bang for your buck and don\'t mind a little bit of clacking, look no further.', 'Pros: The mouse click is extremely silent and I love that. Fits my hand nicely.Cons: The mouse DPI lags. There are 5 levels, and I have it on level 5 (the ""least delay"" in motion) and wish it was quicker, more reactive, fluid. Also, while the mouse is extremely quiet, the keys are annoyingly loud. Defeats the purpose of an ultra quiet mouse when the keys sound like cheap plastic being pecked.I would return if I didn\'t have to deal with my company\'s reimbursement dept. Ultimately just not what I was looking for; I wanted a super quiet keyboard and mouse - only got half of that and even then the fluidity and motion response of the mouse isn\'t ideal.', 'I really love the keyboard. You can feel the keys, the ""presses"" are excellent. I also love the color and feel of it. The mouse is really nice, very, very quiet and smooth. The only problem is that the buttons click very easily. All you have to do is just barely lay your finger on it and the button clicks. I am constantly right clicking. But overall, beautiful keyboard and mouse set. Would recommend 9/10.', ""My Dell PC suddenly stopped recognizing the old keyboard. I guess the wire of the keyboard got damaged. I have another old, wired multimedia keyboard but it's very large and typing is mechanical and the layout of the keys are different from the other. So, I decided to buy a wireless keyboard. Overall, I'm happy with the keyboard and mouse. I wish I could give 5 stars but there are a couple of minor things I don't like. Here are some pros and cons.KeyboardProsOne of the main reasons I chose this keyboard is the layout of keys. Alpha-numeric keys are well spaced, not too tight compared with other slim-type keyboards I searched. There is a wider horizontal space between FN keys and number keys. There is also a wider space between F4 and F5 and F8 and F9. I'm a developer and very often push FN keys. So, this wider space is very good to easily locate FN keys (I can type without looking at keys). The look and feeling is very nice, not a cheap plastic. Gray board and black keys look more modern than other all-black keyboards I searched. The charging was quick and when I inserted the USB receiver to my PC, PC instantly recognized the keyboard and mouse. The sleep mode works fine. There is no obvious delay when I type while it's in sleep mode.ConsIt advertises an ergonomic keyboard but the softness and quietness of the typing could be improved. When I type a key with an angle, it's sometimes pushed like a mechanical key with a slight rubbing sound and feeling. I have another HP all-in-one desktop with a slim-type keyboard. That keyboard gives me softer and quieter typing. There is no FN lock feature. Its' OK as I use this for my work and rarely need to use multimedia functions (e.g. volume) but other keyboards I searched had this function. There is no indicator of power.MouseProsLike the keyboard, it was instantly recognized by the PC and works fine. A click is very quiet and responsive.ConsIt looks very cheap. It's too small and light. I'm not a tall guy but still I feel it too small. When I move it, the nail of my little finger scrubs the mouse pad more often than the old, Microsoft mouse I used. The smoothness of the mouse movement is not always good. as it's too light and smooth over a mouse pad, I rather need to carefully move it to prevent too much movement. It has five levels of DPI. But for me I don't feel any differences between the first four. At the fifth level, it suddenly moves too slow. And there is no indicator of which level the mouse is at (there is no control panel or whatever in Windows 10, either). So, the DPI feature is not very useful.So, I wish the mouse could have a better quality but overall, the keyboard and mouse are worth the price and they work just fine. I would recommend this combination if you are not too picky about the mouse."", 'Use this in my office everyday since I got it. Works great love the color. no problems so far. battery life has been past 2 plus weeks. I do charge it every 3 weeks, plug it in on Friday at the end of the day and its ready to go Monday', 'I am using this wireless keyboard and mouse for the first time today, and I\'m VERY IMPRESSED! I was hesitant to purchase the set since I wasn\'t familiar with the brand and there weren\'t a ton of reviews yet. I wasn\'t super concerned about the mouse, but after recently trying out (and then returning) a well-known brand name wireless keyboard, I had three main questions:1. Would there be any lag? Nope - not even a little bit. Lettering shows up right in synch with my typing.2. Would any of the keys require extra pressure (i.e., the space bar or other ""high use"" keys) - Nope, not at all. I don\'t miss any keystrokes, and the keys don\'t require a ton of pressure.3. Would the layout allow me to adjust easily from my laptop keyboard? Yes! I use an HP Pavilion, and the layout is very similar, so I adjusted even after just a few short minutes of use! They layout is pretty traditional, and the size of keys and the spacing between keys is nearly identical to my laptop (14"" screen on the diagonal; 12.5"" across).Additional pros:- It didn\'t take long to fully charge the keyboard or mouse, and I was able to use them both seamlessly after turning them on and plugging in the USB dongle.- I write constantly throughout the day and tend to rely heavily on the right ctrl button for arrow shortcuts. Many wireless keyboards I considered had only one ctrl button on the left side, but this keyboard has both right and left ctrl keys.- I already love having the calculator key, media keys, a ""right click"" or menu key (this one was new to me), and the number pad. I\'ve been using laptops and tablets for so long, and I always seem to miss the number pad when doing calculations. It\'s worth the extra length to me.- I like the low profile on the keys. They do make a light clicking sound when typing.- They keyboard is fairly lightweight, but it\'s heavy enough to stay in place while I type (The rubber pads on bottom help).- The mouse is also lightweight and pretty small, but it serves my needs so far. (Someone with larger hands might not like it.)- I really like that both devices are rechargeable and don\'t require me to replace batteries. This is a huge plus and unique from most other wireless keyboards I checked out.-The price was great! I can\'t believe I got these two together for such a low price. The quality is much better than I expected for this price.Cons (if you can call them that):- It\'s a darker gray than I expected. I was hoping for more of a silver to match my laptop and monitor, but the keyboard is definitely gray with black keys, and the mouse is black.- The keyboard is raised in the back (3/4"" high in back and 1/4"" high in front). This is fine for me since I am using it while standing; however, I\'m giving the ""ergonomic"" aspect 4/5 stars since there is no way to lay it flat, which would be slightly better on the wrists.I highly recommend this set for anyone who likes a wireless workspace and for those who type a lot and prefer a traditional keyboard layout.', 'Ame usar un mouse que no haga ruido, se me hace muy cómodo para el uso que le doy. Además de que es bonito estéticamente elegante', 'I bought this keyboard and mouse combo for work and it worked GREAT up until this last month. Now I’m noticing that when typing, a lot of letters and numbers are missing causing a lot of errors that I’m having to fix. The mouse is also starting to have issues.

I thought maybe it was time to charge both the mouse and keyboard but that didn’t work :(', 'Sirve la pila dura bastante y lo puedes conectar a la lap y seguirlo utilizando.

At its low price point, it is a steal. It is as ergonomic as my old Logitech G502 wired mouse, yet also lighter and obviously wireless with low latency. It is excellent for right-handed use, high quality, with nice, tactile buttons, and feels smooth on a nice mousepad. Moreover, I personally found the mouse perfect for my work/play situation due to its dual connectivity options: Bluetooth to connect to my work MacBook Pro, and Hyperspeed for my Gaming PC. Switching between modes is practically instant using the power switch. Bluetooth is adequately reliable and fast for MacBook use, even when connected to a 144 Hz monitor. This dual connectivity option is one of the main reasons I chose this mouse over competing mice such as Razer’s mamba wireless (as well as its low price compared to mice such as the G502 Lightspeed and Razer Basilisk Ultimate). Besides, it has an excellent battery life, too, especially when running on Bluetooth.However, there are a few minor cons that I have noticed. Firstly, it has no RGB lighting… For a Razer mouse, it is very odd not having RGB. But, this also means that the mouse has a very clean, stealthy aesthetic, not as aggressive as the Logitech G502. Also, no RGB means it has a great battery life. Further, there’s no need to mess with Razer Synapse for RGB, so I haven’t even installed it on my MacBook (not that Synapse 3 even works on MacOS…). I have, however, used synapse on my PC to remap the side buttons to switch desktops on Mac, which is stored onboard the mouse, making it very practical for a MacBook.Another small issue I noticed is the scroll wheel tends to automatically click when scrolling up, especially when scrolling up at high speed. I have addressed this issue by remapping the DPI switch button as the middle/scroll click button, though it isn’t ideal.Overall, this mouse is perfect for my use cases, very cheap, great battery life, ergonomic, fast, and accurate. Despite a few issues such as no RGB (not even a basic green Razer logo) and scroll clicks when scrolling up, this mouse has my recommendation!', 'I like the shape of the mouse and the hand grip. The mouse is also responsive and sensitive. All in all, it was a good buy!', ""This mouse made me have carpal tunnel. The battery also dies extremely fast, I don't use bluetooth and the batteries die every 1-2 weeks."", ""Update March 2022: All to note if the razer software will wake your PC up from sleep, they have been work around on forums but i find this is a small hitch just need to switch mouse off.

Mouse pointer movements are smooth and accurate. However, battery life is shorter when using rechargeable batteries, compared with my Logitech mice. I am turning the mouse off after each usage and hopefully, that would help extend the battery life.', 'Mostly for office work at home.', 'It is very clicky and has its own software to customise the mouse, this is not like a fake review so be assured:)', 'Be careful with Razer products -- many of the mice sold online are fake. This one is legit -- the serial number registers on Razer, and it works perfectly in Synapse.Mouse is great. Surprisingly comfortable for smaller hands. Some of the edges are however a bit sharp.

So, if you want a cheap keyboard that works maybe 98% of the time, do go ahead and buy.', 'Use for about two months and battery life getting shorter and key label could not be seen if light goes off', 'In our office we’ve been using K70 MK.2 Low Profile Rapidfire mechanical, and K83 membrane keyboards from Corsair; as well as Lenovo laptops as our standard for key feel, actuation distance, response, and quietness.  Now we’re looking for new ‘boards closely mimicking the typing experience of Lenovo’s upper echelon laptops (the ones we have anyway) with enhanced features varying in significance depending on overall execution.We gleaned a lot of input especially through YouTube and omitted the Logitech Craft “Advanced” Keyboard for among other things - paint wearing-off the keys.  Corsair K100 Air, and Razer DeathStalker series were excluded chiefly for the ridiculously high prices with a possible dent in the cost-to-longevity lottery vs. customer service reliability.So we ordered a JLab Epic keyboard but the keys were wobbly, and when using a finger on the volume knob there was too much resistance often causing the board to slide as a result.  Two or more fingers on the unfortunately short knob usually brushed against the BT2 key which took a further hit on design confidence.  Though the keys were reasonably quiet with short travel, there were no standalone keys for media control, Home, End and Windows functions; we don’t require a number pad, ROI was cost prohibitive and no one really gravitated to it so the ‘board was returned.Attention soon focused on Logitech’s highly functional and beautiful G915 TKL in both color schemes but we quickly learned of the infamously wobbly keys, high price, and lack of hot-swappable switches.  But the very appealing form factor and aesthetics became the benchmark so as luck would have it, Youtubes by The Provoked Prawn, Refreshingly CoZChristopher, randomfrankp, ECPU, Caleb Thornton and others brought the K621 to light.  Understanding it’s “inspired” by the G915 TKL while possibly recalling the Egyptian falcon deity Horus, along with unique pluses, minuses; hopes of recent updates, and shockingly low price for what’s on the check list, we purchased two:• White keys/silver deck• Black keys/black deckIn the Box• Keyboard with a 2.4GHz dongle in a magnetized cubby tucked in the chassis’ underside.• 5’ 2” USB A-to-C (90° angle for the Type C) cable matches the ‘board’s key color• Keycap puller• Switch puller• Four extra switches• A few stickersGeneral UseThe power switch on the ‘board’s left side needs to be switched ON for wireless and Bluetooth communication, and OFF for USB.  In either case it’s slightly difficult to engage/disengage.Pros1. Very thin profile allowing hands to be in a more comfortable position compared to non-low profile ‘boards, resulting in wrist rests that aren’t needed, for us at least.2. Slightly smaller footprint than the G915 TKL.3. The 2.4GHz dongle storage is a thoughtful touch especially when toting from place to place.4. Legs on the underside deploy solidly in either position.  When ‘open’ they raise the deck about a half inch in back.  Rubberized non-slip pads on back and bottom of the legs aid the two non-slip pads under the chassis’ front.  They do a good job of keeping the board in place while in use on smooth wooden surfaces or desk mats.5. System BIOS/UEFI is accessible through the USB cable; some ‘boards can’t do it.6. Connecting up to five devices and switching between them on the fly, the M Status LED shows a different color for:• Bluetooth 3.0/5.0 (both appear as selectable devices in my phone) BT1-blue, BT2-cyan, BT3-magenta• 2.4GHz - green• USB cable - white when the battery is fully charged, red when it’s chargingAd copy indicates there’s no latency with the upgraded BT and 2.4GHz wireless chips which we confirmed through key presses and media controls at roughly 6 feet.  But when using BT1 two inches away from a phone there were missed key presses, and sometimes a normal press/release of the up or down arrow key resulted in the cursor continually moving until the key was pressed again.  Something similar happened in 2.4GHz mode with a completely different key.  In both cases the keyboard was situated between a phone and PC.  There’ve been no problems so far with USB.7. Switching between connected devices takes about a second, when in close proximity anyway.8. Hot-swappable Outemu Low Profile Linear Red Switches with Cherry MX-style stems (shaped like a +), require only 40 grams (1.41 ounces) of force with a 1.2 mm (.05 inch) actuation distance.  Both are less than the G915 making it easier on the fingers with better overall usability and feel compared to the K70’.9. If a number pad is needed you can purchase Redragon’s K618 (full size keyboard), or a separate number pad from a different manufacturer.10. We use the dedicated media controls a lot especially the dual-function knurled roller which moves in stepped increments (two at a time in windows) and makes immediate changes in volume or backlight level corresponding to how quickly you move it.  When it’s used as the dimmer, the arrow keys briefly flash letting you know that full brightness or backlight off is reached, a very nice touch.  Engaging either mode requires pressing the rubberized round key just left of the status LEDs, and it will stay in that mode until it’s pressed again.The play/pause button is useful when working on a project and needing to pause foreground or background media, YouTube, etc., to handle other activities then continue from there.  This is preferable to a mute button as none of the media is skipped, a reassuring design choice.  There are situations though when a mute button is warranted, like needing to hear something in your immediate environment without stopping a game for instance.11. When wirelessly connected - all LED’s timeout at 55 seconds to preserve battery life.  Any key press except moving the roller instantly ‘wakes’ and registers that character on the screen depending on the key.12. Touching the rubberized G and media keys provide pleasant sensory input of the ancillary functions somewhat mitigated by their pivoting movement if pressed near the perimeter.13. Two product color variants: black keys and deck, and white keys on a silver deck with a brushed finish.14. The aluminum deck brings a hint of rigidity, and heightens the aesthetic.  Subjectively it would be nice if the black version sported a dark gray brushed deck to augment the black keys a la G915.15. 20 different multicolored backlight presets (some interactive), the ability to choose static colors, white or no backlight means no pressing need to install software, another check in the win column.  An app however is available to personalize backlighting for each main key, and help refine macro functions.16. RGB especially in a dark room on the black version is understated and preferred by some, as comparatively there isn’t nearly as much light reflecting off the deck which enhances the aesthetic.  The silver version however easily reflects a diffused wash of light from the deck providing additional ambience preferred by others.  I thought it’d be a questionable source of light pollution but when the ‘board is on a work surface in front of you - it’s gorgeous, they both are.17. Primary and secondary key legends are backlit unlike the G915 and other ‘boards which annoyingly only target the primary.18. Double-shot removable low profile sculpted key caps with Cherry MX-style insert are replaceable if there’s a suitable option.  “Double-shot” refers to an injection molded plastic for the alphanumeric characters, surrounded by an injection molded plastic outer layer forming the key shape.  Depending on assorted variables this should last longer than a single-shot for a key shape which receives a painted color and laser etch to create the characters.  After a while the paint tends to wear-off through usage and it looks pretty bad often leading to early e-waste.19. Didn’t think I’d like the logo but it’s growing on me; not quite as “office benign” as Corsair’s but it’s a welcome addition in our workspace nonetheless.20. The Windows Key can be disabled.21. W, A, S & D game functions can be transferred to the dedicated arrow keys.22. Keys don’t wobble or rattle unlike the G915, and stabilizers under longer keys do a nice job.23. Absolutely no body flex when typing.24. The USB cable’s 90° bend is handy for a particular station we have where the user’s drawing tablet is in very close proximity to the keyboard, and a USB connection in back of the ‘board wouldn’t easily allow it.25. Rumor has it when the ‘board is USB’d to a PC and the Redragon’s software is open it will do an automatic firmware check and update.  Presumably the firmware in our decks is current as the software gave no indication one way or the other.  Still the software should communicate the current firmware version and if an update is ready to download.26. Onboard memory for personalized lighting profiles and macro key presses with the G keys and M keys is convenient.27. The keyboard is lite and small enough to travel, so grab a suitable case and go.Midpoints1. The logo on one ‘board appeared to have a smooth finish while the other had a small wrinkle near an edge.  Not knowing if it was a manufacturing defect, curious fingers soon found it was protective film that we since removed.2. Legends on the lighter key caps are easier to see without RGB in a lit room than their darker counterparts.3. Waiting to see which key color shows more wear.  Will the light colored keys look dirty more quickly over time, and/or will the darker ones show more wear/shine through frequent usage?4. Waiting to see how long the ‘boards last in our work environment.5.  Customer service: I sent an email to them just after midnight not long ago and in less than two hours received a very cordial and thoughtful response, as well on the following nights to get a better understanding of current issues, adding to owner satisfaction.  Unfortunately Redragon haven’t addressed the BT and wireless issues noted by others that have been lingering for some time.Cons1. Typing with a Bluetooth connection was hit and miss with too many misses; 2.4Ghz had one mishap when there should be none, in either case it doesn’t inspire confidence.2. Media keys are briefly lit when pressed which needs to be the other way around, seemingly a quick fix for Redragon.3. Caps Lock and M LEDs are too bright, especially when the deck is plugged-in and the battery fully charged turning “M” into a constant visual irritant.  Hopefully this will be changed soon by the manufacturer, in the meantime thin film products or dark ink will hopefully address the issue without looking tacky.4. No explanation in the manual of the “down arrow” LED between Caps Lock (A) and M LEDs.5. No way to adjust the backlight time-out.6. The three ‘status LED’s’ don’t indicate battery level except “M” when it’s time to recharge, and the software doesn’t display the battery at all.7. The keys don’t approximate the better Lenovo laptops for short travel, and especially quietness.  This is very important for people in a wide variety of job titles and use cases where quiet operation of a keyboard is paramount. The K621 and the K618 in this regard is disappointing, but people accustomed to mechanical keyboards may like it.  Even though we have K70’s they aren’t great for typing and office productivity so we use them for other functions.8. Can’t find a truly quiet lower profile switch/key cap set, yet.9. Connecting the USB cable at both ends doesn’t auto switch to it, it needs to be selected by pressing Fn/5.Changes We’d Like To See:1. Alter the media key’s lighting scheme as noted and allow them to be RGB customized and dimmable, use the G915 and other noteworthy ‘boards for examples.2. Lower the status LED’s brightness and make them dimmable with the main keys but not all the way off.3. Use Fn/B keys to temporarily report battery charge status by lighting applicable F1-F10 keys from orange to green.  F1=10%, F10=100% with ten percent increments for keys in-between.  When it’s at 5% turn F1 red, when at 2.5% blink red repeatedly on/off indicating the ‘board needs to be charged.4. A dark gray brushed aluminum deck to augment the black keys.5. Higher contrast legends in the black key caps.6. Utilize a better power switch for feel and movement.7. Going forward ensure all packaging and protective shipping solutions are compostable and/or recyclable materials.  There’s no need for the plastic bag, end cap and twist tie for the USB cable. The two pullers (without the current resealable bag), and USB cable can be shipped in accessories boxes within the main package.  The protective shipping sleeve covering the keyboard should be a different material, which if suitable would also allow the logo to be protected.8. Option for near silent (not figurative) switch/key combos.  Though pressing/releasing one of the extra switches proves they’re very quiet, for some reason actuating a key cap/ switch mounted in the deck makes it highly audible unfortunately.  Most people won’t remove key caps, remove then disassemble switches to apply lube, close the switch housing, affix a small rubber O-ring to each stem then take apart the chassis to apply soundproofing before putting it all back together and voiding the warranty.9. (Integrated with #8) Option for lower key travel.  For gaming enthusiasts the ‘621 and ‘618 have exceptionally low travel, but for the millions of people acclimated to very good laptops, the K621 and K618 need improvement.10. Provide underbody channels to route the USB cable: left, back, or right on a MKII version.11. On the MKII version place the nine keys below the volume/dimmer control to just above the up arrow key.  To the right of F12 place three buttons shaped like the round G and Media keys (without the wobble) for:• Mic on/off• Mute on/off for speakers/headphones/earbuds• Camera on/offThese are advantageous for office productivity, gaming, podcasts, meetings, Helpdesks, etc., additionally the mic. and camera controls offer privacy.Or the three keys could be populated in the unused deck space just above the up arrow key.SummaryAll things considered the K621 is feature-rich and heading in the right direction at up to ¼ the cost of its Logitech counterpart depending on market variables, while bettering it in notable areas.  Unfortunately it’s marred by some issues so we’re still looking for a quieter lower actuating product with features, ergonomics and aesthetics this ‘board offers, but nothing to our knowledge comes close at the price….. yet.  Would we purchase another?  With their affable approach to customer service and our experience with the board: yes, but only for USB and 2.4GHz; and BT for basic controls, but waiting to see if they effectively address the current issues.Writing the review I used the ‘621 to wirelessly type in my PC’s word processor, while BT’d to my phone listening to tunes, changing tracks and pausing/playing when necessary.  Switching between them was quick, effective and a pleasurable experience.In ClosingIf Redragon take the load off their CS Department by implementing astute changes, and effectively market the results to a much wider demographic without unnecessary price hikes, their brand visibility and bottom line may increase notably for the efforts going forward.  Question is: how cohesive and skilled are their management, engineering, marketing, sales, manufacturing, ecology, quality assurance, packaging, and distribution teams to continually get it done while steadily improving compliance and reducing their carbon footprint?From office building dwellers, content creators of all sorts, project members, home theater enthusiasts, to those wishing not to disturb nearby family members; there are vast markets moreover people to reach and enhance the quality of their lives.', 'Pros-----+ Lightweight+ Premium feel and looks great+ Really good price for basically Logitech\'s G915 knockoff+ 3x BT, 2.4G and wired connectivity+ Nice feel and overall typing experience+ Solderless replaceable switches (maybe even hot-swappable?) and you even get 8 of them in the package!Cons------- My volume wheel won\'t wake up the keyboard when scrolled. Personally I also prefer buttons but it is what it is...- Battery lasts for about 5 days (without any RGB backlight)- Software is as with any other HW manufacturer quite bad. Still better than Logitech\'s LG HUB. And it will say ""device disconnected"" until you connect the keyboard via cable.- No dedicated mute button. Although you can remap any key via SW so I\'ve put it in place of the menu key- Rubberized macro and media buttons. The rubber won\'t last as long as a plastic ones and because they are so mushy I sometimes press too little and it won\'t register the press.- Short range for 2.4G connection, maybe even BT but I haven\'t tested that- Their SW program cannot manage the macro keys (G1 - G5)- Battery indicator. I don\'t understand how you can cram so much RGB into this keyboard and decide that the battery indicator will just either blink red or glow red/white... Now the battery glows green until it starts to flash red but that\'s already too late and the battery dies soon after.My rant---------Coming from the Logitech G613 I finally don\'t have a key chatter and I absolutely love the feel when typing. The spacing of the keys takes some use to though. For the weight, against that chunk of metal and plastic this keyboard weights next to nothing.And that\'s about where my enjoyment ended. As mentioned before, the wheel for volume won\'t wake up the keyboard when it goes into what they call an ECO mode (basically a sleep mode that the keyboard goes into after a minute of idling), the battery lasts only about 5 days which is a huge downgrade in comparison to my old G613 that lasted with two rechargeable AA batteries for 2 months in an average. And to top it off, the range on the 2.4G connection is really bad. I have my PC placed behind me so the keyboard had to connect through me and my chair but it barely managed 3m range. Fortunately I have a USB hub right on the table next to the keyboard so I\'m using that.Experience with their support----------------------------------Now, the battery bothers me a little but I got used to it, the range problem was solved rather easily but my main problem as mentioned 2x is the volume wheel. With that, I\'ve contacted Redragon\'s support from which I have mixed feelings but closer to the positive one. Overall I would say they really, really tried but I got nowhere. They asked me for some basic information like S/N, order number etc. Also they wanted a video so I did that as well. Then about a month of radio silence, saying that they are contacting the manufacturer. After said month, they\'ve come up with a firmware for me to try. No success. After that they sent me a replacement which had the same problem. So I had to bother their support again. Overall we\'ve exchanged 19 mails. Eventually they\'ve partially refunded me 20$ but my problem remains unsolved for now. Their communication was polite, patient with me and left me with really positive impression. Probably the best support experience I\'ve ever had and despite the fact they weren\'t able to solve my problem.Summary-----------Overall I can\'t complain because there isn\'t anything like this. Rather cheap (mind you G915 costs 3x as this one), has almost all media keys but I\'ve mapped the mute function onto another button, no key chatter and even if it would occur I can just swap the switch and it has 5 macro keys with 4 profiles. And if anything goes south too much, their support will find a way.Ideas for future generation-------------------------------I really would like to see these features in the new generation to make the product even better. - Removable battery. This is a keyboard, it\'s nice that it\'s so light but you don\'t need it to be, it eventually ends in your lap or more likely on a table and that additional 50g won\'t hurt anyone and it will drastically increase the it\'s lifespan because as it is now, in a few years this keyboard will become a wired one when the integrated battery dies.- Proper battery indicator. Just do a proper color cascade from green to red and vice versa while charging (maybe with a breathing effect while charging so the user knows what is going on)- Open-source the software. I don\'t understand this, why is every company so ignorant about their horrid PC applications that annoy anyone because they don\'t work? Either invest some proper time and money into it or simply make it open source and the community will fix the crap out of it if nothing else.- Dedicated mute button. And I can\'t stress this enough. Why do I need a button that toggles between volume and brightness? I will set this once and never touch it again so why isn\'t the brightness some combo under the Fn key?- Unite master record and macros for that matter and the software. Why is it even split up? Why can\'t I define different key mappings under a different profile? Why can\'t I define a macro from the application?- Ditch the rubber caps. The mushiness is causing missed presses and I bet after a while these caps will start to disintegrate.']"

Need to download asus armoury software to change it.', 'The mouse has excellent innovation with the joystick although it is currently rarely used. However the only downside i can find on this mouse is that it is heavy.', ""I got this for a couple reasons, primarily to replace my aging SteelSeries Rival 650, and also because I liked the features and connectivity options that this mouse offered. My experience with it so far has been decent, but not as polished as the price would suggest.The good:Overall, the mouse itself performs admirably. It charges fast, it feels great to use, it's comfortable over long periods, and it does everything you would want a mouse to do. It is very fast and responsive, I use it primarily with the 2.4GHz dongle, but both the wire and Bluetooth work nicely as well.The joystick does work and seems to fit to where I rest my hand on the mouse pretty well, but it's a bit of a pain to configure (more on this later) and I leave it primarily in digital mode, mapped to various keys.Also, this mouse has headlights! The RGB on the front is insanely bright, it looks like something out of Tron:Legacy on full brightness (+1 on style points) and even on half, which is where I leave them, the front of this mouse has a visible halo on my mousepad.In terms of construction, it feels very solid, everything fits nicely, and the magnetic elements used to hold all the interchangeable bits together are very high quality and fit together seamlessly. It comes with a bunch of very nice extras, including a little neoprene sleeve for the mouse, which is great, and includes everything you need to swap the switches, the RGB dial in the back, and the joystick cap. These additions almost make up for the price. Almost.The bad:My biggest gripe here is software. The Armoury Crate (their spelling not mine) stuff it uses, particularly Aura Sync, is buggy and inconsistent. Half the time it doesn't recognize that the mouse is plugged into the computer. Also, all the stock RGB options are noticeably jerky. Smooth fades? Never heard of them. Compared to the SteelSeries stuff I'm used to, the experience was downright awful. Trying to set up a custom RGB effect requires the use of Aura Sync, which of course means the profile is saved on the computer, not the mouse. So it goes back to whatever onboard default you last used when the software inevitably glitches or fails to recognize the mouse on startup. Layered effects? Possible, but incredibly difficult and unintuitive to try and set up. The Aura Sync stuff feels like a crappy version of Movie Maker where you have to set up an RGB timeline for the effects. What in the actual heck? I just want a nice looped effect, darn it. Oh and even if you set up a decent fade cycle, half the time it won't look right because for whatever reason this thing ALWAYS has to cycle through some red or yellow between colors that aren't next to each other on the spectrum (blue or green to white transition? yeah, it goes through red first). So yeah, nice fades are completely out.</endrant>Another slight downside is that the joystick isn't the easiest thing to set up, I had some trouble getting Steam to recognize it properly at all, and without any Steam profile, game support for the analog input setting was hit or miss. Also it only supports 4 keybinds if you leave it in Digital mode, it would have been nicer if you had options for 6 or 8 to use the diagonals as well. Honestly I'm wondering if a Dpad or 8 way hat switch on the side of the mouse wouldn't be more useful in that regard (product idea, anyone?). As expected based on the RGB experience, the software support and options for this from ASUS was next to nonexistent, you have some very basic options but not a lot of advanced configuration stuff like you might hope for the price.My last and final issue with this is that the Qi charging is really, really slow. I didn't expect it to be particularly fast but it really shouldn't take more than half an hour to charge up the battery 5-10%, and this thing was definitely taking longer than that (and no it's not the Qi pad causing the issue, it charges just fine with other devices). On the bright side, it does hold that charge for a long time, I haven't seen it drop more than 25% over the course of 2 days of solid use (of course the battery indicator in the software only goes in increments of 25% so it's impossible to tell what percentage it's actually at).Overall:I think that this is a good mouse with a great feel and design, but it's really let down by the crappy software. The features are all there, but without good software support they don't always work so well. I'd give this a 5 star rating in terms of concept and physical implementation, but I have to knock off a star because at this price I would expect that the experience would be a lot more polished. I'll update my review if it ever gets better, but I kinda doubt it.As much as I like using it, I really can't recommend this mouse in terms of the experience for the price. If it was $75-90 it would be a different story, but for $150 (or $120 on sale when I got it) it's just an overpriced prototype with a disappointing software implementation. Then again, this is ASUS we're talking about, it's not surprising that this is what you get. Nice hardware, terrible software. If you really want the joystick and all the extra connectivity and stuff, you could maybe justify getting this at the sale price (like I did) but for full price, you should probably go elsewhere."", 'I did some research on a few mice before settling on this (Asus ROG Chackram Core).  I\'ve been gaming since the early 2000s, and tend to be a bit picky with my mice.  I\'m an average FPS player (maybe a bit above average on certain games), but not a pro or anything like that.  But a good mouse can make a difference.  Some reviewers of mice have shown this mouse has a very good and accurate/consistent sensor, and very low latency, so that\'s a plus.First off, this mouse is very light!  I am coming from a G602 that has batteries in it, that is quite a bit heavier than this.  Being so light, this mouse seems faster than the G602 because it moves so effortlessly. Even at the same CPI as my old mouse, it felt faster.  I actually had to lower my in-game sensitivity a bit when I started using this mouse to be able to hit my shots.  Took a few days to get used to the speed, but now I\'m really doing well with it.Comfort-wise, I find it very comfortable.  the two side buttons that I use with my thumb are pretty close to the position I was used to on the G602, which as the best side buttons IMO, but the Chakram side buttons are good and have a light, but positive click action.  The directional controller in front of the thumb is a bit too far forward to really use efficiently, at least for my hands.  If asus trimmed the back of the mouse down a bit, and shortened the overall length of the mouse, I think this thumb controller would be a lot easier to reach, since you would be able so shift your whole hand forward a bit.  I don\'t use this button/controller thing at all though, but it could be use full in MMO games or something similar.  currently it\'s bound to the arrow keys, so you can move your curser around with it in windows apps.Now the software to configure the mouse is part of Asus\'s ""Armoury Crate"", which is designed to interface and control all things Asus.  It\'s also just short of a dumpster fire.  The actual part that configures the mouse is really basic and fairly simple, but it installs all kinds of other junk on your PC.  If you happen to have an Asus motherboard, or any other Asus products, it installs all kinds of utilities and services that run in the background.  I have my PC running pretty lean.  I\'m at about 70 process after booting up and letting the machine settle in for a few minutes.  After installing the Armoury Crate, I suddenly had over 130 process running after boot!!  Be sure to go to the asus website and also download the Armory Crate UNINSTALLER when you download the driver suite for this mouse.  then you can setup your mouse, sync the settings to the onboard memory, and then uninstall all the junk that comes with Armory Crate.Once the settings are sync\'d to the mouse, you don\'t need the drivers installed, and the mouse will work with your settings on any PC you plug it into.', 'Despues de casi 2 años. En general todo el mouse es bueno, todos los botones le funcionan bien, la rueda se siente bien, las luces y los efectos se ven bonitos, no tan llamativos como otros mouses, es más sobrio, pero le dan un acabado bastante bonito, y el software te da buenas opciones de personalización.ProsTiene 3 modos de conexión, por cable, bluetooth y 2.4G, si tienes varias compus esta muy bien porque puedes brincar de una compu a otra con un solo botón.El plástico mate que tiene se siente un poco raro al principio, medio áspero, pero no se le quedan marcados los dedos.Me encanto el hecho de que tenga imanes para que se pueda desarmar fácilmente y cambiarle los microswitches si se le llegan a descomponer sin tener que soldar y desoldar. Lo mejor de los mouses asus la verdad. Le he cambiado los switches 1 vez y se siente como tener mouse nuevo.También me gusto mucho el echo de que la palanquita que tiene la puedas programar de dos modos, analógica como un joystick de xbox o digital para que detecte 4 direcciones diferentes, es como si tuviera 4 botones laterales adicionales. Le puedes meter macros para programas que uses.Si tienes un mousepad o algún cargador inalámbrico, el mouse tiene carga inalámbrica.El software es bastante bueno y te da muchas opciones de personalización, pero si es algo tardado de instalar.ContrasLa mayor contra que tiene (aparte del precio) es la ergonomía.El mouse esta ""gordo"" de la parte de atras donde la palma descansa en el mouse porque ahí tiene la pila interna. Desafortunadamente esto hace que el mouse se sienta pesado (122g) y grande. Si tienes mano mediana te puede dar problemas con el agarre y la comodidad. Si eres de mano chica no te lo recomiendo.Lo que también conlleva al problema de la posición de la palanca. El mouse presume mucho su joystick analógico, pero está en una posición terrible. Esta muy hacia adelante, haciendo que si lo quieres usar, efectivamente tengas que mover toda tu mano de posición para que tu pulgar la alcance o que necesites una mano gigante, tirando la ergonomía por los suelos y haciendo el joystick prácticamente inútil en juegos. (Sin embargo, para cuestiones de productividad esta bastante bien pues ahí no te afecta la velocidad a la que presiones o el tener que mover la mano).Le doy 4 estrellas porque esta MÁS que bien, pero su mayor fuerza, el joystick, es también su mayor debilidad.', 'I\'ve been using this mouse for nearly 3 weeks. I spend a lot of time at the PC, both gaming and doing creative work so my mouse gets a lot of attention. I\'ve gone through 4 mice in the last 5-ish years, I\'m not overly hard on them, but they end up developing some kind of issue that isn\'t worth repairing. The only mouse that I don\'t hate and still works is a Logitech 502, but I\'m not a particularly big fan of its overall feel, particularly the scroll wheel. My last mouse, a Corsair M65 Elite stopped registering left clicks. I got a replacement from Corsair, and the replacement exhibited the same problem almost a year later.While looking at quality replacement mice I came across the Asus ROG Chakram. I honestly didn\'t know Asus made peripherals. I\'ve used their motherboards, monitors, and graphics cards, but didn\'t know they were in the keyboard and mouse business. I did a bit of review-searching as I do with nearly everything I buy and I thought it was worth the gamble. I haven\'t used a wireless mouse since, like 2002, so figured they have gotten better since then.First thing, this is the mouse premium-feeling and well-presented mouse I\'ve used to date. The box is large and has that lovely soft-touch-coated feel. Inside there\'s a lot of stuff; but the highlights here are hard-shell case with user-replaceable switches and thumbsticks. There\'s also a USB A-to-C cable, and a USB C-To-A adapter (I\'m guessing for use with the wireless dongle, if your computer doesn\'t have USB A ports). Also included, for who knows why, is a zippered neoprene-like pouch for the mouse and accessories.Down to business, though, the mouse feels nearly perfect in the hand for me. It has a gentle rightward slope that I like and the palm fills my small hand well. The clicks feel good and can be changed with the included replacement switches (AWESOME!). The switches have failed on several of my other mice so I\'m looking forward to easy replacements without soldering or replacing the whole mouse. Front and back buttons are easy to get to and have a nice little ridge to help identify them. There are several pre-installed profiles and DPI settings that can be changed, but I found the stock settings to be very close to what I\'m already accustomed to. The skid pads on the bottom are nice and slick and it glides effortlessly on a nice mouse mat.I have mine running with 2.4ghz wireless using the included adapter and I don\'t personally notice any latency versus a wired mouse, but I\'m not a ""hardcore"" gamer. It\'s a bit heavier than my old Corsair mouse, but again, I\'m not somebody that\'s going to notice 20 grams or somebody that needs the lightest mouse on the planet with honeycomb lightening holes. I\'ve played dozens of hours of games already and find it perfectly acceptable for everyday use and heavy gaming. It got me through DOOM Eternal, so it\'s perfectly adequate. ;-)I find battery life to be a bit disappointing. It\'s easy enough to recharge with a USB cable or Qi charging, though. It does go into sleep mode after 3 minutes of inactivity which helps save battery power. This can be further tuned with Asus\' Crate software. The thumbstick isn\'t very convenient in my opinion. It works, but for my small hand it requires some wrist tweaking to be easily reached. I\'ve remapped the thumbstick directions to 1,2,3,4 keys so I can remap game keybindings easily. Overall, I really hope I love this mouse for the long-haul because it\'s not cheap. It\'s more than twice as expensive as the most expensive mouse I\'ve bought to date, but I\'m hoping things like the premium build quality and user-replaceable switches can help balance out the cost over many, many years.', ""At first glance, this is an expensive asking price, BUT, its worth it, imo.First of all, if you are pairing with other ROG products, it stitches in seamlessly with the Armoury app. I got it as a companion for my M16 Laptop, software immediately picked it up, and was good to go in secondsNext, the freaking joystick on the side! So it has a few features, and these are changeable in the Armoury app as well, so it can act as a 4-way and be arrow keys (default) 6-way, or 8-way (I believe it was...). In playing MMORPGS like runescape, you can absolutely just one hand skilling with this thing. I put my laptop on the table, sit back on the couch and skill away while watching tv or something. Arrow keys are on the mouse. Plus you have your typical side buttons for like melee in FPS games and whatnot. I have heard word of being able to map the joystick directions to like MMO hotkeys - haven't tried yet but that would be plain unfair and disrespectfully awesome.Bluetooth AND 2.4ghz, so nice. And the bluetooth is really good too, no random disconnects yet. Coming from a hardcore Corsair fanboi, this is impressive.Feel and build quality are exceptional, in my opinion. I know some other people were iffy on it, but this is far from my first $150+ mouse, its par or better than the razer/corsair/steelseries pricepoint competition. Its a medium weight mouse. For the size (kinda long), its light. I prefer a heavier mouse, and this is on the low end of what I would consider heavy. I have pretty large hands, and a regular mouse pretty much sits in my palm, end-to-end - so I have to like hike my hand up to use a mouse, like cage it in my fingers, move with my pinky and thumb... THIS one, however, is nice and spacious, and fits perfectly in my palm with ample space to actually rest my fingers on the buttons, for once. So nice to use a mouse like a normal person.It does have wireless charging and quick charging. I just threw it on my phone dock, and it charged. Neato.The mouse comes with a nice case, some spare parts/tools, quality sleeved cable, and it is usb-c (thank god).ALSO, there is a small white disc that comes with it. DONT THROW IT AWAY. This is so you can add your own logo/name/whatever, and put it in the back of the mouse for the RGB to shine through. If that isnt the coolest sht ever. Find a friend with a cricut and get it made. The ROG plate comes off easily, and the mouse backing is magnetic. ALSO, in that compartment it has storage for the dongle."", 'Excelente calidad, acabados, materiales, la verdad es una obra de arte de Asus', 'Excellent weight and customization. Packed well with lots of configuration options']"

I was worried about any potential lag or connectivity issues, but Razer has nailed it with this mouse. Whether I'm immersed in an intense FPS game on my PC or exploring open-world adventures on my PS5, the response time is impeccable, providing me with the precision I need for every move.The design of the mouse is also a standout feature. It's ergonomic and fits comfortably in my hand, even during long gaming sessions. The textured grips on the sides ensure that my grip is secure, and the customizable buttons are perfectly placed for quick access to essential functions. Razer's attention to detail in the design truly sets this mouse apart.The optical sensor is a dream for gaming accuracy. I've noticed a significant improvement in my aiming and tracking, which has greatly enhanced my performance in competitive games. The adjustable DPI settings allow me to tailor the sensitivity to my preference, making it versatile for different game genres.Another aspect that impressed me is the battery life. Despite the wireless functionality, the battery lasts for an impressive amount of time. I can go days of heavy gaming without worrying about running out of power, and the included charging cable ensures that I'm never caught in a situation where the mouse dies unexpectedly.Razer's software integration is also noteworthy. The ability to customize RGB lighting, program macros, and fine-tune settings adds an extra layer of personalization to my gaming setup. Plus, the software is user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for gamers of all levels to make the most out of the mouse's capabilities.In summary, the Razer wireless mouse has proven itself to be an essential addition to my gaming arsenal. Its seamless connectivity, comfortable design, precise sensor, excellent battery life, and customizable features make it a must-have for both PS5 and PC gaming enthusiasts. If you're looking to enhance your gaming experience, I wholeheartedly recommend giving this mouse a try."", 'If u have a pc, get a wireless mouse with cell inside, this is really good for laptop users, u can just keep some batteries around', ""- The Whole mouse feels like a plastic body. Don't get me wrong, it's very smooth, just not rubbery.- Mouse fits in my hand nicely, just that it's a little small for my hands. Maybe just my hands are bigger.- The weight is also very good.- Movement is smooth. BUT I HIGHLY recommend having a mouse pad.- MAC OWNERS be aware of the software!! if you have a windows around you only then buy it because razer synapse is not available on mac!!- Side buttons are very clicky and I like them.- On the go DPI control is very smooth."", ""Checks every box of what it's supposed to be.

I thought that this would be a nice alternative for the kids to use, instead of being on the electronics at times. Surprisingly, they seem to like it very much!

They started drawing, doodling and using their mind to come up with all sorts of things.The tablet is well constructed and feels as though it can stand up to the abuse that it's about to face.  I was also going to comment on the brightness, in which I thought could have been a little bit brighter, but on second thought, it would probably just run the battery out quicker, leaving me to charge it up more often.  Also, it really doesn't look that bad if your not using it in extremely bright areas.

And much, much later, an unfortunate second coffee incident motivates me to buy a new mouse. Thankful for a good price and, despite my shortcomings, a great product!"", ""Keyboard Pros:- All aluminum construction. It's got a little bit of bow but not enough that even the heaviest typer will notice. Overall build quality is borderline excellent.- Included dongle range is good. I don't have direct line of site and where it sits it's blocked on 3 sides with a cold rolled steel 15u server. The only escape is tempered glass on the front and 10 feet away it doesn't miss a keystroke.- Keys, although chicklet style, are very usable. This wont help you play fortnite better, but it's good for typing. There not a lot of horizontal shift in the keys and they don't feel at all mushy. They bounce up good enough that you don't need to slow down your typing.- Battery life seems good. The fact you can recharge the battery is a great bonus at this price point.- On/Off switch which conserves battery life and makes it so my year and a half old wont mash the keys when I'm getting him cheerios.Keyboard Cons:- Could have used a backlight. Not something too much to complain about at this price point, but would be nice.- It's a little thin on the  bottom. Another inch or so of material would give lap typers somewhere to put their hands when they are typing. I can see they were going for small and minimalist but anyone who's got a PC hooked up to a tv will tell you, a little extra palm and wrist support goes a long way.Mouse Pros:- Still rechargeable- Works I guess?- On/Off buttonMouse Cons:- Not at all ergonomic. Long term use for a heavy computer user would easily cause finger injuries from the shape of the mouse.- Unlike the keyboard the mouse feels like an afterthought. It's great it's included and doesn't require an extra dongle to use, but it feels cheap. Clicks sound weird and the scroll mouse doesn't allow for fluid scrolling and instead only allows step scrolling.- no extra buttons to speak of. Usually even a cheap $10 mouse these days has a forward and back button.- Giant hole where the dongle used to be on the bottom. Very easy to get crud buildup in. Not a great design.- SO lightweight. Where the keyboard is a fairly heavy slab by keyboard standards, the mouse weights practically nothing at all.In conclusion, the keyboard is a great buy on its own. Its attractive looking, and easy to type on. The solid build quality is great at this price point and should stand up to minor abuse without issue. The stuff is very easily plug and play on most systems and range is good and accurate. The mouse is a mess. It's good to have included just in case your real mouse dies and the fact it uses the same dongle is great for people who tend to lose small pieces. I switched it out with my favorite wireless mouse (Logitech MX Master 3) which is an unfair comparison at almost $130. But pretty well anything short of an Amazon Basics mouse would probably be a step up on this one.I really like the keyboard. And for the sub-$50 category, this is an excellent value. The mouse would be nothing more than an emergency mouse but again, it's nice that something is included in the box. This may be the first sub-$50 keyboard that I would give a buy to as long as you're not looking mechanical feel or cherry mx. It's a no-frills clean design that I'm sure I'll use for a while."", 'I would say perfect, mouse is extra silent (version with back buttons), keyboard is fine except the backspace button which is smaller than usual but I,ll get used to that.', ""J'aime beaucoup.

If you're looking to take your gaming experience to the next level and gain a competitive edge, the Logitech G Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse is a must-have addition to your gaming setup."", ""Logitech has done an outstanding job manufacturing a wireless competitive gaming mouse. I personally will never be sold on the idea of a wireless mouse being better than a wired one just because of signal interference alone, this does not detract from the fact that this mouse is indeed a dam good mouse even for fast pace FPS shooters. I will try to go in order writing my review of this mouse from opening to playing with it.*Packaging*For a $150 mouse I expected more from the packaging however I do understand that maybe Logitech wanted to keep things simple. There is no wow factor here just a simple small box wrapped in plastic. Looking at it from the outside you wouldn't be able to tell this thing costs$150.*Opening*So once I got into the box that looks as though the contents of it didn't cost $150, I was once again taken aback. Reason being that the mouse was just sitting there unwrapped. The reason this kinda surprised me was because I had to make sure that I didn't accidentally order a used mouse. Nothing against used electronics but I generally stay away from them because they could potentially have unseen underlying issues, however Amazon and their generous return policy has restored some of my confidence in buying them but I did not want to go that route with this mouse at this price point. The mouse did have tape on the underside once I lifted it from its cradle  but again I did double check to make sure that it wasn't a used product. I removed the tape from the underside and checked the mouse skates for any signs of scratches and everything was cool.*Package Contents*The package contained what you'd expect. The mouse, a wireless dongle, and a cord all wrapped and in good condition. One thing that concerned me that I wasn't sure about was whether or not the buttons on the right side of the mouse were preinstalled and to my relief they weren't. The reason I say this is because I prefer not to disassemble my electronics if I don't have to, if you have to then you gotta do what you gotta do but I work in maintenance and repeatedly taking something apart and putting it back together causes excessive wear and damage and I'd prefer keeping my $150 mouse in pristine condition other than normal wear and tear.*The Mouse*The mouse itself felt great, it felt solid and sound. The shell was sturdy I'm a heavy handed individual and I was comfortable applying normal pressures from my hands to the mouse with fear or it being damaged or broken. The mouse slides gracefully across the mouse pad out of the box so you won't encounter issues there, I would've preferred they used the mouse skates Razer has been using on their largest mice but it is what it is I ordered some Hyperglides to replace them.*Installation*So the mouse is plug & play, I already had G Hub installed and the software recognized the hardware  no problem. I didn't have to update any firmware or anything so that was cool I just plugged the dongle into the computer and turned the mouse on from the bottom and it was good to go.*The feels*So I have large hands and going into this I expected it to be small for my hands and I was correct. I use somewhat of a palm claw hybrid and I found that I had some empty space between my hand and the mouse itself which is kinda like a dead zone and could cause slop when making fast movements. Like I said I anticipated this going in so I can't say I'm disappointed. The side buttons are nice as well as far as where they are positioned and how they feel when you press them, they're very responsive. My only gripe would really be to move them back a little but I attribute that to the size of the mouse itself if the mouse was a little larger they'd naturally be further back. The button position in relation to the size of the mouse is fine and about where you'd expect them to be. The two main mouse buttons feel pretty good as well the clicks sound good and feel equally as good I had no double click issues or indications thereof. One thing to really look out for are people buying this product used from someone else who had the double click issue and sending it back then someone else buys the mouse again with the same problem and all of a sudden a lot of people end up sharing the same mouse with the same issue leaving the same review complaining about the same problem. I've encountered no double click issue so far. The weight of the mouse itself is great as well it feels really balanced not too light but not too heavy.*Tracking*So this is where the rubber meets the road, I wanted to test just how good this mouse is and if it's as good as they say it is. I tried this thing out not in Microsoft word or nothing like that I went straight to Apex Legends and COD. I went into G Hub to check my configurations and much to my surprise I didn't have to do anything another good thing about G Hub is that your settings apply universally to all Logitech mice so because I had profiles set up for one mouse they assumed it'd be the same for this one so that was a good surprise. The mouse tracked very well I have to admit I was impressed for a wireless mouse that didn't fit my hands that well I performed amicably and even was champion a few games and I'm not one to argue with results. The mouse tracked even my most minute movements without skipping a beat.*Conclusion*I was on the fence about even picking up a wireless mouse because I wasn't sure if the technology was really ready for competitive gaming but it has come a long way. My only real issue with wireless is the batteries, no matter how good the battery may be eventually it will wear out and turn your wireless mouse back into a wired one Logitech could circumvent this by making the battery removable but they'd sell less mice in doing so. Which leads me to the reason I chose Logitech over Razer because I've had to trash a wireless mouse once already in the past granted the technology back then isn't what it was today. I'll hold on to the mouse because I like it and it performs it will be the one in the arsenal. I've attached some photos of the mouse alongside some more other popular mice in the game for size comparison. Enjoy."", 'Let me start off by saying that this mouse is absolutely FANTASTIC! I have been using it for nearly a week now and have already fallen in love. Before this mouse, I used a Hyperx pulsefire haste, which is around 60 grams and is pretty good, but It started acting up only after a year of ownership. This mouse weights about 20 grams more but doesn\'t feel like it, the weight is balanced so well that it feels like an ultra-lightweight mouse, and the battery life is incredible especially if you turn off the RGB (you can do this in the Logitech G Hub software). I\'m predicting around 7-10 days of use, using it around 8 hours a day. The build quality is pretty good and the mouse is extremely comfortable, the scroll wheel is tactile while also not feeling ""crunchy"" and the buttons all feel top tier. The tracking is also exceptional and I have not experienced any issues with the sensor. There are 5 DPI settings by default, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, and 6400 which can be swapped by using the button on the bottom of the mouse. You can make your own profile in the Logitech G Hbu software and set your DPI anywhere between 100 and 25600. You can also change the polling rate in this software, the 4 options are 1000, 500, 250, and 125 hz. I would highly recommend this mouse to anyone who is in the market for an extremely comfortable, well-balanced, and reliable mouse.', '*UPDATE* I received my new mouse and have had zero issues for a while now. Incredible mouse. I have to say I\'m incredibly satisfied this thing goes as long as it does without requiring a charge up. If you can avoid the defects, this mouse can only be improved upon by an ergonomic choice by the players.That is to say, if you want something more from this mouse, it would be your subjective taste in how a mouse feels in your hands that would affect your selection. Hand size, grip style, and posture will be the biggest determinant. If you like ambidextrous ergonomics or palm grip, this is about as sublime as it gets for snappy flicks. Very stable tracking for continuous movement of the mouse as you maneuver around an angle. Great responsiveness, but I do feel that ""break-in"" time with this mouse is longer than most that I owned. I can pick up most mouses and after a few days of DM be completely comfortable with a mouse. This one took weeks, but it rewards you with a really good sensation.It\'s how I imagine it feels when a runner finds the right running shoe. Maybe a better comparison is upgrading to a better headset. You can ""tell"" this one is different and somehow better, it just doesn\'t feel comfortable in the same way a new leather shoe is a little stiff when you\'re breaking them in. If you can afford to try this mouse, get it.----Old Review----I honestly wished I was 1 of the 65% of people who purchase these mice and had zero issues with it. The first three days of using this mouse were sublime. I\'m a competitive Counter-Strike player. Which means I\'m very opinionated about my computer accessories. I have the 240 Hz Monitor, the loud clacky mechanical keyboard, and mousepad that covers half my table. I also happen to have roughly ten different e-sports mice. For me, I tend to go through them rather quickly. I buy them to see if the newer ones have better sensors and to experience the ""hand feel"" of the mouse. If they don\'t make me happy, it tends to sit in my drawer for the occasional LAN party when the console plebs want to experience the beautiful game.The problem with this mouse is very minute but like any papercut. Papercuts tend to chip away at your sanity until you explode in a fit of rage at this minor inconvenience. This mouse double clicks. That is LITERALLY the only issue with it.Now, I understand this sounds a little crazy. However, you need to realize that this is a review created from a series of hilarious coincidences that have convinced me that my mouse is cursed. I don\'t care if a regular mouse double-clicked. I am quite certain if this mouse was in my office at work. I wouldn\'t care. Yeah, it pauses the video right when you click to play them. It mysteriously resizes windows when you\'re trying to move them. Those are minor inconveniences.However, I have never been so thoroughly trolled by a mouse in my life when it comes to Counter-Strike. It has rendered me absolutely useless with grenades. Counter-Strike has these things called executes. Which usually requires the entire team of players to synchronize grenade throws to surprise the other side with our cool use of grenades. I am often accused of purposely losing rounds because of this mouse. I cannot seem to hold a grenade in my avatar\'s hand before I immediately throw it at where ever I happen to look. Which in some cases are the backs of my teammates or an entrance we have to run through.So what are the benefits? I\'m far more accurate with this mouse. This mouse is incredibly precise. You can repeat the same motion of flicking the mouse a certain distance, and you will always turn at that radius. It gives a very snappy response, and there\'s no strange ""glide"" feeling like a razer mouse. It should be like this for an esports mouse, especially for shooters. However, the fact this is a wireless mouse, and I can\'t emphasize this enough, the fact I can\'t tell the difference from this mouse and Zowie mice is remarkable.I have avoided wireless mice for a long time due to issues with lag and inconsistency in my mechanics while using one. The higher the refresh rate of your monitor, delay in wireless mice is magnified. So consistency is essential for me. I never once thought, the reason I lost an aim duel was due to this mouse. It never failed to do its job. It felt natural. Remember I have ten mice I could switch back at any moment. I didn\'t even want to consider going back. That\'s how good it felt to use this thing.I\'m going to take my chances with replacing the current mouse and pray I don\'t have another one with this issue. If I don\'t have any further issues, I will update this review.', 'Mouse is great. .  fast, light,corded or wireless. No ussues.However the only negative i had was Amazon continuous shipping delays.... out if the past 10 orders I placed atleast half was delay or had to be purchased again so I have to sit on the products funds until they figure out the problem.  Realy frustrating...', ""I am a die hard Logitech fan when it comes to peripherals, been using a mice, keyboards, and headsets from them for years now. I was a very big fan of the g403 and bought a few wired ones as well one wireless. I broke most of them as I used to rage but was especially a fan of the wireless, Logitech knows how to do wireless. I always kept the weight in the mouse so I am more used to heavier mice. Because of this I was somewhat nervous to try a lighter mouse, I wanted to try the superlight but I read reviews of more problems with that one, and with the price tag and larger jump in weight difference I thought the regular G pro wireless was the right choice. When I first got it took a bit of getting used to because I would put more effort into my flicks because I was used to more weight, but it didn't take long.The build quality is very good as always with Logitech in my experience, I have had no issues with ghosting, double clicks etc. The ergonomics are similar to the g403 but different on the sides. The stock sliders are pretty good and I don't think I personally need to change them, although I am not that picky when it comes to that. The scroll wheel has a bit more feedback than the g403 which is good because that mouse had almost none. The mouse buttons are more clicky, lighter and feel more responsive than the g403. The side buttons are smaller but also more clicky, but also stick out more than those on the g403 which makes it easier to engage. The logo is a customizable LED which you can change or turn in the G Hub (great app btw), the scroll wheel no longer is. The sensor is much more precise than the prodigy sensor that I am used to, which was still good, but not close to this one. It also has a larger DPI range than before, which I don't use but its cool I guess. It does not have a DPI switch button on the top anymore, but has one on the bottom, which again I do not use as I have always had it disabled, but is nice to have if I need it. You can also charge this mouse wirelessly via mousepad or some other setup, and can add a weight if you desire to do so. I was very surprised at the battery life on this thing. It was good on my previous wireless mouse but this thing only needs to be charged every week at the most for me. When you turn it on out of rest mode it has LED dots that tell you generally how charged the battery is, but you can also check the G Hub app or it will tell you when it is getting low as a little pop up at the bottom right of your screen. It came with a charging cable that was unbraided so I just used my old g403 braided charging cable as it still fits the micro-usb port. It will not come out when charging and playing and will not change the responsiveness which is really good for wireless. I keep mine on my bungie for quick access and so that I don't notice the wire when using the mouse. This mouse is also ambidextrous so leftys can also use it by swapping out the buttons on the side as it comes setup for right handed users.Logitech is really ahead of the game and has sort of set themselves apart from the competition in the recent years when it comes to wireless gaming, there is not any lag or delay and it is just as responsive as a wired mouse. Wireless is the future and I'm all for it. This is by no means the cheapest mouse, I got it on a deal and still spent a good amount. But it is great for the money, and definitely a competitive gaming mouse that will give you an edge. I think it's great and Logitech has never let me down, so if you're interested in it, and are willing to spend the money on it I say you should go for it and you won't be let down."", ""This mouse is awesome! It's very light in the hand and glides across my desk mat. The Logitech Ghub software is great to help change lighting, dpi, and everything that you would expect to have access to when personalizing a mouse. I'm pretty sure that it made me better at csgo, and it helped me in my love life. You need this mouse."", ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0The size of the mouse is pretty great it is comfortable in the hand. The side buttons on this mouse are great ive had multiple cheaper mouses and the past and the side buttons suck. I've never really owned a wireless mouse before but I think It has great tracking as for the games I've tried it responds very quick with no notable delay. It is a great gaming mouse and I really recommend it especially if it is on sell. You can also use this mouse wireless or wired as in the video in picture I included. The battery life is pretty good but from the reviews I thought it was going to be alot longer. But I don't play the game all the time so that's alright because you can just charge it. I still really recommend this mouse especially if you want to escape those cheaper mouses."", 'It is considerably better than my previous mouse and worth the money. I have better connectivity and it is way smoother. Easy to use and definitely improves my gaming.']"

Don't. Bluetooth pairs fairly quickly however when the PC goes to sleep because it has been left for some time, the bluetooth on the mouse will go to sleep and will not re-pair. Very poor user experience from an expensive 'gaming' mouse"", ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0I'm not a mouse geek but it's not that hard to know when something's really good.This is by far the best mouse I've used. Mainly because of the shape and size.I have no idea how the deathadder is liked by so many. It's a giant Rat. And most importantly, you can't do this (see video)I have regular sized hands and this mouse is a perfect fit. Everything fits everywhere.(Some other mice for comparison in pics).Maybe a little curve on the right too for the pinky finger would have made it even better.I prefer this powdery matte texture and look of this mouse over the shiny plastic. Feels much better to touch.The scroll wheel movement is good. Looks very ordinary though.Although I prefer totally silent clicks, the clicks on this mouse are very satisfying to hear. They sound like high quality clicks if it makes any sense.I don't give a chit about the dpi polling rate blah blah. It's a Razer mouse.  They all are very good for a casual gamer. Although I think even hardcore gamers would have no problem with this one. It's very lightweight too.Cons:1. No chroma lightning.I despise the RGB bs on keyboards. Mouse, mousepad, fans, behind the monitor, inside the cabinet, on the motherboard, cables, hair, beard, moustache, etc. Like a disco for clowns.However I would have loved the dimly lit green Razer logo. Sad there's no lighting of any sort except for the small dot which indicates the dpi set.2. The top is a one piece. I dislike these designs.  They always have some flex. This mouse is well made but would be better if the clicks are just separate. Always .Also this removable top doesn't always sit right in the perfect position. Sometimes it's a single attempt, sometimes it takes several retakes to accomplish the task.I worry this adjustment of taking the top off and put it back multiple times could lead to damage or some plastics breaking.3. Alkaline battery given. I guess the Indian market gets cheaper alkaline batteries and not the lithium ones shown in international reviews.It's an energizer max battery so will last a long time. But after that I hope my eneloop NiMH works with the high speed wireless more.4. Bluetooth mode is garbage as usual. Just like every other mouse.  Also noticed, the dpi set in high speed mode will be wayyy to high for Bluetooth mode and you will have to set it lower every time you switch. It feels like the pointer Just skips a lot in Bluetooth mode. And it takes a while to wake up from rest in Bluetooth mode. Sometimes 4-5 seconds !5. Although the quality is top notch, it's obviously not worth 6-7k.  Under 4k would be a good deal.6. Warranty is just 1 year and because it's American, good customer support is unlikely. They like to blame everyone but themselves. So you rely on luck in case something goes wrong even after overpaying for the product.7. (For white one) it will get dirty if you're not careful. Keep some cleaning material and wipe it off couple of times a month.8. (Will fill this soon)Finally, how long all this goodness lasts determines how many stars this deserves.It's a  4.5 ⭐ for now."", ""It's nice and light I haven't had any problems with it yet"", 'I have been using Orochi V2 for 2 months now, I have primarily bought it for gaming on Xbox and it is incredible while playing FPS gaming (Apex, Halo Infinite).The weight is approximately 62-65g with the battery and if you use the 2.4GHz dongle for connectivity, you will get the best lag-free connection. The switches are clicky and not necessarily noisy and the scroll is not as free-flowing as you would expect with respect to productivity mice but good nonetheless.', 'Lightweight and button is clicky.', ""This is my first ever gaming mouse so I'll probably be wrong about a few things so please bear with me. Now with that out of the way, I'm moving over from a Microsoft Wireless Mouse 3500 that I bought and have been using for over 10 years and will be comparing my experience to that. Now I understand that it's not fair comparing a gaming mouse with a cheap office mouse but after using it for so long, I just don't really remember the feel of any other mice.A lot of people talk about how small the Orochi V2 is, but to me it's actually bigger than my previous mouse so it actually felt really awkward at first. I have medium sized hands and until now, the back side of the mouse has never rested in my palm but with the Orochi V2, it actually reaches my palm. This really put me off at first but the feel of having something to rest on is actually quite nice. The little added curve on the left side for the thumb is just perfect too.As to the feel of the mouse, the plastic on the Orochi does feel very cheap but I can see clearly that this is Razer's way of reducing the weight of the mouse. Whether the plastic is durable or not, I have no way of finding out but I'd truly like to hope it is, only time will tell.Speaking of weight, after reading some reviews, it is clear that it's a big plus for a lot of people but personally, up until now I never really thought too much about it. Though after getting my hands on it, moving over to the Orochi V2 was a huge shock, I couldn't even imagine that a few grams could change the feel of a mouse this much. Whether I'm a fan of it or not though, I still have yet to find out.Connection via Bluetooth was actually very smooth for me and honestly, I have no issues with it. Now this may be because I'm using a laptop and not a desktop computer but I couldn't really say anything too bad about it. Other than it taking a few seconds to wake up after idle, Bluetooth mode worked perfectly fine.I've read that the Orochi V2 is supposed to come with a lithium battery but I received an alkaline one. I personally use rechargeable batteries so it doesn't really matter to me either way but I am curious as to why the change.Now onto the biggest and probably the worst issue I have with this mouse, Orochi V2's USB dongle interferes with anything using the 2.4Ghz frequency. At first I thought it was just NBN being NBN but after an hour of horrifying low 1-3Mbp/s speeds, I started suspecting the dongle. After some searching, I changed the channel on my router and that fixed the issue temporarily but the issue came back in seconds. It seems Razer's Hyperspeed technology just congests the 2.4Ghz frequency so as long as you use Wi-Fi on the 2.4Ghz frequency or any other Bluetooth technology while you have the dongle plugged in, you're going to be crippled.Overall, I truly like this mouse but this dongle issue really needs to be fixed. Until then, I'm probably going to be stuck using Bluetooth as the main connection."", 'I bought the Razer orochi v2 mainly for gaming as well as work. I have a 20cm by 10cm hand, but the mouse fitted it well and I could use it for claw grip and finger tip grip.The switches are very satisfactory with great sound. Connectivity is seamless. Highly responsive at 1000hz. The mouse is 66gm with a lithium aaa and 71g with provided aa battery.The chalk like yet smooth surface feels premium and the shape is very comfortable and maneuverable.My only con is that sometimes there is a minor 1-2 second stutter when I connect the wireless receiver in usb 2.0 port, but in usb 3.0 or 3.1 port no issues. Probably a firmware update by Razer will fix it.Overall very satisfied and highly reccomend it if you want a lightweight wireless gaming mouse. Worth the price.', ""I have used this as my main mouse at home for more than a year and have no complains. I haven't had to change the batteries that often since I only use it for light browsing after work and with very light gaming. If you're worried about the white colour looking grimy after awhile, yes it can eventually pick up dirt but all the dirt comes off easily with some isopropyl alcohol and since the shell is a matte plastic, it is easy to wipe it down.

I feel more  supported than any other plastic or different shaped pad I’ve tried. Very handy to be able to place it independently for where you want support., and it’s not rock hard support, it sinks in as it holds your weight. Part of me is liking supporting my wrist and start of my palm more instead of the wrist alone or arm.  Doesn’t seem like a low quality to me like other people say. It looks nice, the feel is very soft and not cheap. The pad definitely doesn’t move as you use it. It’ll go slightly downward passing  near the seamed areas but it doesn’t move the pad or interfere with the cursor or Anything. It’s fine. I’m impressed with how the cursor moves with no interrupted speed while on a more material surface. It’s also not loud on the material just a very faint sound but not even noticed when you’re using it. The best part for me was more about the materials. The mousepad market seems so toxic and not evaluated for your health. Everything else I’ve tried involved some kind of plastic or material with a strong smell that stayed on your skin and surfaces. I would list this as no smell. There is mild cardboard or foam like smell to it but really not an issue. I know it’s no worry thanks to the package also showing Rohs on it. I once tried a HyperX pad, similar design idea but the smell was just suspicious and strong and transferred to every surface . Might have been the cooling gel in it, either way it’s toxic and if your skin will be on it for hours, go with a safe option.So just for the material safety compared to the rest of the market I will stay with this and even replace it if needed due to wear.I think it would be a long time before it would wear and chances are if it does, it would probably just be a bit rubbed out material, never a hole or anything serious.Update: I’ve used it two weeks now and can say it’s my most favourite of all rests available. So comfortable and supportive. I like being elevated too.The only thing, depending on your mouse, the material pad can slow down the cursor response a bit or if not slow down, just interfere with movement. For instance my large mouse has no issues at all, and my small mouse has slight issues, the solution is to up your cursor speed in windows. That should make it fine to use. So depending on your mouse you may need to tweak the setting to operate properly with this material.

The box looks nice and have that look that you wouldn't' expect to find on a graphic tablet made in China. The box is sturdy, firm and feels like it can withstand almost everything and very well designed by the way. what's on the box is what really matters. A Deco 02 tablet that comes with a ring or roller wheel to set with the last shortcut key and has a lot of built-in functions. This roller wheel will save a lot of time for you because when we artist tend to calibrate sizes of the brush or doing the zoom in and out, this roller wheel comes very handy ( way better than shortcut keys). Also it comes with a sort of lid or cover for the ring made out of rubber, which is nice to the tact and easy to handle.  The pen is a passive pen that won't need any charge and very ergonomic and light ; even this time xp pen put an eraser on the pen...that is cool. I remember that the old wacoms had it, not anymore though on the more advanced models. This eraser will save you time since you don't have to use the switch buttoms on the pen to change from brush to eraser.  The pen comes with a practical pen holder, very hard and durable, it will old the pen on your desk, also carries the pen nibs and the pen. I wish my artist 15.6 should have had one of those.When it comes to performance, this tablet is way better than my old wacom. It can register  8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity that helps a lot when you are doing digital sketching, painting and inking on many programs, I have tested it with Photoshop, Krita 4.0 and Sketchbook Pro. It works like a charm with all the pressure needed in all of them.The only cons is with Krita, that sometimes start behaving erratic but that is not only with xp-pen, also has been reported with the latest wacom's. I think this tablet is great for everyone who is on graphics with a budget and also for professionals digital artists like me that are looking for something smooth and precise that will perform great and would not put you on a serious debt. As an additional, the pressure sensitivity and the tablet drivers are so easy to calibrate that it works right out of the box on my 12gb old Imac 2011 with OSX High Sierra...  Yep this tablet will do its duty very well."", ""I've been using this now for a few weeks for Photograph editing, I couldn't be happier with it, for my purposes it was money well spent, it's much quicker, accurate and more natural than using a mouse with PaintShop Pro and Capture NX-D, in general the mouse is faster for initial sorting, thinning and moving RAW files but if I have this in use editing photographs and decide to move files I don't bother reaching for the mouse (you do need to be mindful of inadvertently dragging the pen tip on the tablet and unintentionally dragging and dropping files) the scroll wheel was very appealing and the deciding factor In choosing this tablet, it turned out to be every bit as useful and convenient as I had imagined, I have two minor complaints, I thought I'd be using the pen button for a right button click, but being flush and needing a fair bit of pressure the pen tip was deflecting by the time I clicked the button, this made it impractical for me to use as a right button click, the Scroll wheel can be programmed to do five different functions and I found the pen button to be more practical to use for toggling through these functions, that brings me to my second minor complaint when you are toggling through the scroll wheel functions a small message appears on the monitor for a split-second indicating what function it's in, the messages colour is a light grey colour and falls in an unfortunate spot close to the taskbar and is very hard to see depending on the background it's up against, I did discover (if you're very quick) the message can be dragged down to the taskbar (or any other convenient location) so it can be better seen, but it does seem to have a mind of its own as to whether it's going to stay there or not, it may stay there for two or three restarts then move back to its original position, the message only stays for a split second so its not intrusive and would be nice to see this resizable and or the ability to change to a brighter colour, I can't comment on what this would be like to draw with (circles, arrows and text on a screenshot is the extent of my drawing talents) but if you're looking at this tablet to make photo editing easier and more pleasant, I would highly recommend this product."", "">>>UPDATED 11/25/18<<<Spent about an hour testing out the hotkey and dial maps I created for Affinity Designer. I can say that I do not miss the second button on the stylus nor the loss of two hotkeys on the drawing tablet itself, the dial took on several functions on its' own.Again very happy with the Deco 2 so far.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just arrived and installed so this is the first reaction. I took my time looking for a tablet upgrade. Previously I had been using an Adesso T12, and it did the trick. So, why upgrade? I mean I lost two hotkeys and a button on the pen after all. Let's start by saying that I chose the Deco 2 because I will eventually move up to a graphics display. At this time I did not have the funds nor did I use my Adesso more than twice to three times a week. However, now I am drawing almost twice as often.  The review for XP-Pen products at the tablet level is reasonably high; I always look for reviews close to my purchase date. However, some of the reports currently on the displays are a mixed bag, leaning towards good though. That purchase is in the future, so what about the Deco 2?Well, out of the box it has solid construction, the pen shape is comfortable for my hand, though lighter and shorter than the one with the Adesso, probably because it contains no battery. The tablets pen detection is excellent and as advertised. After two reinstalls with the driver, I was up and going. I had no issues with the nib end acting as the pen/brush and the eraser end performing as such. The dial has very smooth action, and the buttons have slight resistance.  The working area is smaller than on my Adesso, but the mapped working area fits just right with my screen. I will be working closely with the tablet to determine how I want the key mapped. I primarily use the Affinity line of software, and there was no issue with jumping right in after a quick check on the pressure setting between both the driver and the application I just did a bit of doodling. I plan on using the tablet today for general mouse work and using the dial for scrolling. Just to get used to the pen and dial.Overall I am happy with this tablet will be providing an update in the future as I work with it."", ""I was in the market for a drawing tablet and after doing a ton of research looking at the different brands and models I landed on this one for a few reasons. I have used a Huion tablet in the past and didn't like how bulky the pen was, so XP Pens sleek hexagonal pen looked great. The only complaint I have about the pen is that the side buttons are very easy to lose track of, otherwise, it is very comfortable. The other thing that interested me and that I very much enjoy about this tablet is the wheel, it works exactly as I had hoped being smooth and responsive. I would recommend this drawing tablet to anyone in the market for one, as a first time user I was very impressed."", ""First the Pros:1. Very affordable and good bang for your buck.2. You get 8k pressure sensitivity and it's really nice.3. Surface is really nice too. Enough friction to make it seem like you're drawing on paper.4. You can customize the hotkeys by different programs, meaning you can program the keys to be different things depending on which software you're using. For example, if I have Photoshop up, the third button is programmed to be Ctrl+Alt+Z whereas in Clip Studio Paint, the third button is [space].The Cons:1. Driver software is clunky. I had some issues after installing the driver where pen pressure wasn't recognized by any drawing programs. Fixed it by uninstalling the driver and downloading an older version of the driver from their website. However, changing certain options from the driver software breaks the pen pressure and stops it from working.2. The side button on the pen is useless. It's designed to be flush with the surface of the pen, so the button's difficult to find. Because you have no idea where the button is unless you stop to look for it, I find myself pressing it by accident here and there. It's also worth noting that this button isn't customizable PER PROGRAM like all the other hotkeys are.3. Drawing surface is fragile. Idk how, because I was really careful opening the tablet and trying it out in the beginning, but the surface got scratched almost immediately.All in all good value for your money and I'm having a ton of fun with it. It's a great pick for someone who's never had a drawing tablet before, or if you're looking to upgrade from introductory tablets like Wacom Bamboo, which is what I had before."", ""I've been digitally drawing for a few years and I had previously only purchased from Huion, so I wanted to give a different company a try when I decided to get a new tablet. It's now broken, which I will touch on at the end.Likes:I like the scroll wheel, but it does take some getting used to. It's a sleek design and I like the type C charger. The hot keys are nice and the size is a good size, not too small or big.  I like that the pen doesn't need any batteries or chargers. It was easy to set up, except for one pretty big issue.Dislikes:With my program, which is Clip Studio Paint, so a pretty big program, the eraser didn't work. I tried so many different ways, but it would not work correctly, so I eventually just disabled it. The set up menu was confusing at first, so it took a bit to figure out.Unfortunately, it isn't very durable. I take pretty good care of my tablets, but at some point I tugged on it slightly because the cord got stuck, and that's all it took. It now doesn't plug in properly anymore. It wasn't much force and other tablets survived far more use than that, and even use from my younger cousin who probably doesn't take as good care of them. But all it took was the cord tugging a bit to put it to the point where it only works maybe a quarter of the time it's actually plugged in.EDIT:I sent an email to the service support shortly before this review was written, and I did receive a response. The customer service was really good. They had me send a picture and video of the damage, redirected the conversation to their amazon store and I was offered a full replacement, which was very nice, since I couldn't draw with the other tablet anymore. Because of that I changed the review to four stars, I think it was some of the best customer service I received.  I just got my tablet and couldn't be happier."", ""Let me say up front - I love the design of the Deco 02, from its macro keys to its scroll wheel to its larger-than-usual work space. It is structurally very well made, the carrying case for its stylus is beautifully designed, and the fact that it uses a USB-C cable in place of the Micro-USBs I've seen on far too many devices in this day and age is a wonderful thing.So why only three stars?Three words: cross-platform drivers.At the time I picked up this tablet, I was relying on a used HP laptop for pretty much all of my on-the-go work. Because of my financial situation at the time, I couldn't really afford the price of a Windows 10 license to stick on the hard drive, so I installed an old friend: Linux Mint MATE.Unfortunately, while test runs on a Windows install had been generally positive, and I'd heard good things about compatibility on Mac devices, the Linux drivers are still in beta. In order to get them active, you have to grant permissions to the driver and run them from the command line, then keep the driver window open in the background the entire time you're working. Button mapping was unclear, and mapping shortcuts was haphazard at best (some keys simply cannot be mapped). I also was not able to locate any way of adjusting the tablet for left-handed use as of the last test (though a cursory check on the web site shows that a new version was released this month, so maybe that has changed). To make matters worse, any changes you make are not saved, meaning you have to make them again every single time you go to draw something.For comparison: a used Wacom Bamboo tablet, bought five years ago as a temporary replacement for a broken Intuos, has full plug-and-play functionality with Linux. You connect the USB cable, and you are able to use the device. Full pressure sensitivity, button mapping, functioning eraser, all of it.Now, I'm aware that Wacom doesn't provide their own Linux drivers at all, which should give XP-Pen a leg up, but the simple fact of it is that their drivers' development cycle is so slow and the drivers' usability is so poor that I'd much rather haul out my (tiny and damaged but still functional) Bamboo than fiddle about with the software for the larger, more ergonomic Deco. And that saddens me, because I prefer the Deco in every other way!While I love this device, I simply cannot recommend it for people who use Linux devices - at least, not until their drivers see a serious overhaul. I very much hope that I'll be able to raise this review score someday soon."", ""I honestly would have given this tablet a five star rating,but something odd happened to it.When I first got the tablet it worked like a dream!But after a couple days the tablet was acting a little weird...It's a little hard to explain what I mean by weird,but I'll try.For example whenever I try to draw a line the line would randomly move without me moving my pen(this also happens when I try to draw circles too).This would happen in some specific areas of the tablet like in the middle or the top right.Usually I would ignore it and move the drawing somewhere else,but that didn't work for long.Soon after doing that the weird line problem just got worse and worse after time.Now that line problem would happen in basically ever space of the tablet.Just the other day I tried to draw something but it was just impossible!I couldn't even draw half a line without the lines just moving on their own.I couldn't even finish the line work without getting too frustrated and giving up.I just want to clarify that I have NEVER dropped my tablet,it has never been accidentally hit by a random object,the tablet has never come in contact with any type of liquid,nor any food.I also store the tablet in a drawer and nobody ever touches my tablet but me.This all I wanted to state about this product.Edit:Turns out that the tablet had dead spots on it.I had called the company and resolved the problem with the tablet not working.They had given me a brand new tablet free of charge, and I just want to say that the customer support is amazing! I’m usually very shy when it comes to talking to basically anyone, but they were very understanding and helped me solve the problem with the tablet. After I received the new tablet I went straight to drawing, and like I’ve said before it was like a dream using this tablet. I really recommend this tablet for any beginner or already experienced artists.""]"

Its gorgeous and its a joy to use every day"", 'I got this because my iMac came with the Magic Keyboard without a number pad. I kept an eye out for another keyboard that met 3 criteria:1) Gave me back a numeric keypad.2) Was backlit (so this ruled out Apple\'s Magic Keyboard with Number Pad). I didn\'t need fancy gamer RGB colours, just something to help me see the keys in a darkened room when watching movies on the iMac.*3) Was wired. (I already had a wireless keyboard. I loved how the Magic Keyboard could work as both a wired or wireless keyboard. Since I was using this on a desktop Mac, I didn\'t want yet another Bluetooth device that I had to recharge.)Most of the backlit Mac-specific keyboards I looked at were wireless/Bluetooth only, so I held out. This Satechi keyboard went on special, so I thought I\'d give it a try.I waited a month+ before writing this review in order to get accustomed to the new keyboard.It does have a different feel than the Magic Keyboard.There\'s more travel (the keys have further to push down) which is a good thing. I just had to get used to it.The ""touch"" and sound of the keys is actually a bit softer than the Magic keyboard, which roommates may appreciate.As another reviewer said, the Satechi keystrokes produce more of a soft ""thump"" than a click.If the Apple Magic keyboard sounds like this: ""clickety-click,"" the Satechi keyboard sounds more like ""thumpety-thump.""I feel like my typing speed and accuracy is about the same as before (except, of course, I type numbers faster on the numeric keypad).On my Satechi keyboard, the number pad keys feel a bit stiffer than the rest of the keyboard, particularly the ""0"" on the bottom. Maybe that\'s partly because I don\'t use them much? So far, the keys work fine but it does suggest there may be some quality-control variance to watch for?I like the looks of the keyboard. Some reviewers reported that their backlighting was uneven to the point that some keycaps weren\'t showing through completely. That wasn\'t the case for my unit. I\'m happy with how all the keys are lit up. There seems to be more light bleed under the top keys than the bottom keys but it\'s not bothersome and I think it\'s a function of my viewing angle.See attached pictures showing how the keyboard looks in the 3 brightness settings in a fully darkened room (movie time!) and a semi-darkened room.Backlight works as expected with macOS Sleep Mode: the backlight shuts off completely when I put the system into a full sleep (via Apple menu > Sleep command).The backlight also turns off after a certain amount of idle time (i.e.: after the last keystroke). I\'m not sure if that\'s 20 minutes or 30 minutes. I don\'t know if there\'s a way to change that. Press any key and the backlight turns back on.Performance wise, this keyboard seems to handle multiple key-presses properly (i.e.: modifier keys) but I haven\'t tested this extensively. So far, arcade-type games in MAME that use multiple button inputs play properly. (Actually, gameplay is improved now that I have full size arrow keys rather than the awkward mix of full-size and half-size arrow keys found on the Apple Magic Keyboard.)Some reviewers encountered phantom double keystrokes on the Satechi keyboard. I think I ran into this a few times in the first few days but I haven\'t noticed it over the last few weeks.A minor quibble: On the Satechi keyboard, F3 shows a magnifying glass, which brings up a Spotlight search field instead of bringing up Expose (or Dashboard) as on the Apple keyboard.Likewise, F4 on the Satechi keyboard brings up the Application switcher (i.e.: Command-tab) rather than Launchpad as on the Apple keyboard.Command-spacebar and Command-tab are so ingrained to me (muscle memory) that having them as dedicated keys doesn\'t enhance my life. (The alternate key mappings seem pretty Windows-centric to me?)My complaint is that Satechi\'s mappings seem to be hard-wired. I tried to change the mappings in System Preference > Keyboard > Shortcuts and it didn\'t work.Oh well... not the end of the world. I just remapped Launchpad to another key (F19) since I now have the luxury of extra functions on this keyboard. (My Apple Magic Keyboard only went up to F12.)(*By the way Satechi: If you did have a version of this keyboard with funky RGB colours rather than jus the tasteful white backlight, I seriously would have considered that!)', 'Purchased & Arrived super quick, package not damaged & product new as requested..First time connect & feels & looks great. No faults as yet.', ""This is a very high quality, great keyboard.Having tried both the X3 and the W3, I would say this (the W3) is just slightly worse than the X3 (the bluetooth version) in a couple of ways, but is definitely better in one way.In terms of ways in which the W3 is (slightly) worse, firstly the W3 has only 3 brightness levels where the X3 has 10. (However, they 3 levels are still well chosen, and the darkest is not too bright.) Secondly (and slightly weirdly), on the W3 then £ and # symbols are printed the wrong way round on the 3 key. (Since this is basically a US layout keyboard, the # symbol should be printed at the top of the key, not to the side, corresponding to the symbol accessed when pressing shift, as is done on all the other numeric keys on this keyboard, and indeed as is done on the 3 key on the X3, which has the same layout!) Related to this, I (again, only slightly) prefer the X3's key labelling, where they just haven't bothering to include the ALT (€ and £) symbols on the 2 and 3 keys at all, I prefer this as it makes the keyboard look slightly neater and less cluttered.Nevertheless, if you're only going to use the keyboard wired, I'd still get this one, even though the X3 can be used in wired mode. In particular, and one key reason why the W3 is better, if you're the kind of person who regularly uses Del/F2/F12 to break into the BIOS menu, then definitely get this wired model, the W3, as *even when used wired* the X3 cannot consistently do this, and (not always, but often, half the time or more) causes the BIOS to report that there is no keyboard attached.To point out another (very minor) imperfection shared by the X3 and the W3, the lighting on these keyboards is just not quite as beautiful as the lighting on a real Mac laptop keyboard - specifically, there are small overly bright spots here and there around the keys, where the light shows through too much, rather then the really uniform lighting around the keys on real Mac laptop keyboards.Nevertheless in build quality, in looks, and even in the above-mentioned quality of the lighting, this and the X3 are _way_ better than any of the (several) other illuminated external keyboards for the Mac which I have tried recently.Finally, the X3 booklet documents this, but the W3 booklet does not: fn+ESC is the way to swap the default behaviour of the function keys, between multimedia key or function key behaviour. The same key combo works on both keyboards."", 'I still prefer the Apple USB aluminium & white keyboard for overall feel. But this keyboard comes the closest I’ve used out of many 3rd party keyboards I’ve tried.Backlight is nice, although unlike the MacBook backlight keyboards, this one mostly leaks light around the keys, only some comes through the key letters.  Still better than not having it at all in the frequently dark room I’m using it in.Good long USB-C cable. (Wish it had a built-in USB hub, but you can’t get everything)', 'Es el mejor de muuuchooosss teclados que he probado para Mac a un precio asequible 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼']"

Thank you.', 'I was a beginner to digital art.  Tablet was easy to set up and get started drawing with.  The program I use it with is Clip Studio Paint and the tablet works pretty flawlessly with that.  Also good pen pressure sensitivity.', ""I'll preface the review by saying this tablet is 100% serviceable and has a nice, professional feel to it. The drawing surface is a tiny bit coarse for my liking but I don't hold that against the tablet.My issue with the tablet is in the pen and the dial. I am coming to this tablet from the Huion 1060 plus, a tablet I bought 4 years ago. I got very used to using the touch keys on it, and I expected to be able to have similar use of the touch keys on this tablet too. Unfortunately, the buttons on the deco pro are sort of stiff and sometimes just straight up don't take inputs if you don't press them hard enough.The dial is *very* easy to accidentally turn, especially when trying to use the touch keys. This led me to disable it entirely, which feels a bit bad considering it's one of the main features of the tablet. I'm baffled as to why they set something so easy to accidentally touch in the middle of all of the touch keys when it could just as easily have been put in the top left of the tablet like other options.The pen is good, kind of. After some light usage I swapped out a nib (not necessary, it could've definitely been used more - I just wanted to reassess the surface with a fresh one) and I noticed the 2 nibs I tried had a tendency to wear sort of fast and get a bit of an uncomfortable edge to them which was noticeable while drawing. This is not necessarily an assessment of the tablet, I could just be pressing too hard or using the pen improperly, but I think it should be known at least. My major issue with the pen is the 2 side buttons on it. They are so flush with the surface of the pen that I had to stop drawing and look at the pen in order to actually find and press them. Comparing these buttons to the pen on the 1060 plus is night and day - The 1060 plus has proper protruding buttons that have a nice click to them.The driver for this tablet is very good. Everything is written in proper english, the buttons are easy to rebind, and there is good customizability for both the dial and the inner part of the dial. The pressure sensitivity and pen accuracy feels very nice, though I did feel like the pen was slightly unresponsive at times. This could be a software issue, so I again won't hold it against the tablet.Overall, this tablet was a bit disappointing to me after hearing so much hype about it. I was able to finish a couple drawings before I felt I had to get a replacement. Some of my issues with it are not things that would bother others, so I encourage anyone in the market to watch many reviews and make an informed decision before purchasing :) pen tablets are a very small market and it can be difficult to find the one that works for you."", ""This is the FIFTH tablet I have purchased through Amazon.  I have bought one of every company but Wacom - they are cost prohibitive for anything I want to use.( Huion Inspiroy ink-no drive that worked, and the drawing screen on the back you could barely see. A gimmick. Huion New 1060 Plus - as soon as I took it out of the package I felt the back bend under my fingers, flimsier than the $30 monoprice, and the EXACT SAME button/soft button/drawing surface! for twice the price! I didnt even plug it in.  Veikk a-30 - touch buttons glitchy, and drive not consistently working. Monoprice - great little cheap tablet,durable, still working after 18 months just fine, working driver. but not sensitive enough. only 2048 levels) I finally decided to bite the bullet and spend an entire 100 to get something that worked. I hoped at least that I would get a drive that worked consistently, and didnt keep changing the button programming on me.What I got with the XP-PEN Pro (small) was FAR beyond my expectations, even if i had not had issues before. The body is aluminum on the back, and the dial is too, making it more durable than ANY of the other tablets I tried. And even though it says 'small' I can barely tell a difference in the drawing area. (My monoprice was 10x6.25,this is 9x5'') The cable is built to sit alongside the tablet, so I dont really notice it.  wireless is a small sacrifice for the abilities of this tablet, IMO. The drawing area has V-shaped lights built into the corners, that you can adjust the brightness to, that highlight the drawing area so you can draw in low light. The dial has a light, too. All blue, non changing color. VERY useful feature. there are also TWO dials, not just one, both programmable to 5 different settings. You can then proram two of the express keys to cycle through each dial's usage, giving you 20 other shortcuts you can use in addition to the 8 express keys, and the 2 on the pen. That's 28 total, if you program 2 for the dials. Then there is another setting that ou can use, called detail mode. If you press a button, it will center in on a small area of the artwork, and zoom in your tablet as well, giving you the entire surface area to draw in the tiny art area. Meaning you can draw tons of detail in a tiny spot. It is very light as well, super thin, and still feels durable. And I have barely used it yet. Oh, did i mention that it also has tilt function? all these functions, in a tablet under 100, and it works well? I think im keeping this one. I'll update if things change."", ""This is my first upgrade from a 2012 wacom bamboo. It was really important to me to be able to zoom in and rotate the image with buttons on the tablet and this does not disappoint at all.No real complaints. Customer service is only available via email at office hours and days of the week but they are very reliable and helpful. I felt respected even if I'm technologically inept."", ""Update 2: I had to return my second unit for the same issue as the first one. USB-C seems to break very easily. I love the design of this tablet. It feels good. But the broken USB connection is a problem. I had to hold it in place with a safty pin, after the USB-C connector started lossing connection.Fix this issue, and you will have a winning tablet. The tactile feel of this one is nice. But it needs a wireless connection.A few days after I wrote this review. the USB C connection on the tablet base stopped functioning. It would disconnect if I tapped the base of the tablet. Amazon did give me a refund and I returned the product and bought a replacement unit of the same make.If it wasn't for this one issue. I would still rank this tablet very highly, as it works really well.Original review:Overall, I am impressed with what I bought. I am on a budget, and I cannot afford a Wacom Intous, so I decided to go with one of these non-Wacom branded tablets.The XP-Pen Deco Pro uses pen technology licensed from Wacom. This is comparable to older Wacom 3 tablets. Which is a tablet that I used before this one.The pen feels like my older Wacom 3 pen, minus the eraser. It does not require a battery. But the XP-Pen Deco Pro has a higher DPi and more levels of pen sensitivity. It feels very smooth.The tablet base has a clean look to it, and a smooth surface. The 8 express keys are nice. I like the touch wheel. It is a good build quality.One issue I have is with the drivers. I use Linux mint, and it is a bit annoying to start the driver with a terminal sudo command. Also, I have to keep the terminal running in the background. But, these are beta drivers, and they do work. It would also be nice if I could hotkey to different screens using the express keys. I have a multi monitor set it, and have to switch monitors using the GUI. The Linux Wacom drivers have a screen switch hot key.But, it is nice to see driver progress on Linux. I do all my artwork in opensorce, as well as animation. I was worried about Linux driver support. Good work XP-Pen team.I have not used this pen in Windows yet, Nor have I tried it with my android tablet.This is a good low cost alternative. If you prefer drawing while looking at your screen. This tablet doesn;t have the feature of an Intous Pro. But it is still excellent for entry level artists and people on a budget. The drawing surface is smaller than my old wacom 3, but this one does feel much smoother and nice sensitivity and some tilt functionality."", ""This thing is amazing! It's my first experience drawing on a tablet and I absolutely love it! The knob and shortcut buttons are insanely useful. I managed to have all the shortcuts I need on the tablet, so I can discard the keyboard when I draw. The only time I need keyboard is when I need to write words. I use it mainly with Krita and it works flawlessly. The pressure is sensitive and the tablet can record the pen hovering over it on a generous distance, making it very useful to see where you're at on the canvas without drawing. The nibs are pretty sturdy, and you can get 50 of them for less than 20$.The customer service is on point. I had a small issue with the one I bought and I brought my concern to the support team. They asked a couple questions and then sent me info on how to ship my tablet back. As soon as I gave the tracking number they shipped a new one, and it arrived 4 days later. The person I dealt with was friendly and helpful. Truly an amazing experience.The thing that surprise me the most is the price for all of this. Maybe its me that's inexperienced with tablets in general, but jeez man it's cheap for what you get. When I was shopping for tablets I chose this one because it had features similar to the Wacom Intuos Pro but it was much less expensive, and I really not regret my choice"", 'Vengo de una tableta Wacom, usándola por más de 4 años. Y renové mi vieja tableta por esta de XP-PEN.Hasta ahora (y lo que me imaginaba), estoy teniendo un problema pequeño con los drivers y son los siguientes:-Si la tableta no funciona en algún programa tienes que ejecutar el launcher cómo mi administrador.-A veces al usar el mouse de la PC (mientras está la tableta conectada) hace que se mueva extraño.-En ocasiones personalizar los botones del ""pen"" no suelen funcionar correctamente.En conclusión... Es una bonita tableta, si, tiene materiales premium pero lo que si vas a batallar (en la mayoría de las veces), será en que los driver se hayan instalado muy correctamente.Mientras que las Wacom serán caras... Pero realmente no hay tanto problema con esas tabletas.¿Entonces vale la pena esta tableta? Si, lo vale por el precio, a pesar de batallar con los drivers. (Recomiendo comprarla cuando tenga un gran descuento).']"

It still took quite the adjustment period to make this happen, but after I had to go on a trip and opted to take the wireless bluetooth mouse with me, this slowly became my goto option after I raided a bit with it. It's still a little narrow for what I would like as my hands are a bit bigger than it, but it is very light making it easy to use with high DPI in a small area, especially when you are trying to game in bed with laptop keyboard + mouse. I never felt like I did quite as well with this mouse as I did with the nagas, but that also could be attributed to amount of time with those mice and more time spent gaming as compared to now, but I think it was worth mentioning (my play-style has me using the mouse number keys as much as possible). Despite all of this, I feel comfortable, and barely hindered by it anymore so it will probably be my goto mouse whether at my desk or on the go.TL;DR = The side buttons are extremely stiff but the product itself feels really nice. Lightweight, good battery life, mild RGB, great tracking and probably more suitable for FPS than other MMO mice. Solid first attempt mmo mouse from steel series but would wait for a sale.Full backstory on why I wanted this product and unfiltered thoughts below.As someone who has been using MMO mice ever since I picked up the first razer naga back whenever that came out, I have been incorporating 12 buttons on the side into my gaming experiences. I absolutely love this design, but was quite devastated with the lack of options in the market today. To finish out my journey, after I had to decommision my old razer naga after years of service (The physical materials gave out before the switches failed), I moved to redragon mouse which I later traded to a friend who had a naga 2014 he didn't like (which was a bad move as the naga 2014 had horrid tracking issues), next I saved for a naga trinity which was fine despite not wanting the other side panels, and then the left clicker started wearing down less then 2 years in, which replicated in all the people I knew who also had the mouse in even less time. I lastly bought a naga X feeling kind of bummed after 2 bad buys, to have the double clicking issue again pop up in that mouse only 7 months in. Convinced Razer's ability to make a well designed product has left them, I was ecstatic to see a steelseries MMO mouse enter the market.Onto the actual review of this product, I primarily have been playing FF14 and utilize all the side buttons to click my abilities in a very quick fashion. I do endgame raiding so need to be fast and accurate with my button presses. I haven't tried to raid yet with this mouse, but my first impressions are that it is going to require some adjusting to get used to. The side buttons are way stiffer than any other MMO mouse I have tried so far, and quite a bit longer meaning I will have to slide my already large hands up and down a little bit to accurately reach from the top to bottom rows. If I wasn't trying to actively press them quickly, its very comfortable to hold without that, and might be really nice for when I move over to FPS games or general browsing. For my use case however I am slightly concerned.My next observance is the honeycomb design, this is my first time owning a mouse that is just open like this one. You can directly see the PCB through the open shell. I don't know what this speaks of for long term use, but sometimes I do get sweaty hands as many MMO sessions can carry on a for quite a bit. I don't think it will lead to anything, but just leaving it out there as a mild concern.The rest of the mouse feels fairly well designed. The clickers don't feel to bad, the multi connectivity is something I have missed since my original 2 nagas, and bluetooth while I haven't tried it seems like a nice touch as well. You will need a type C port to use the 2.4ghz dongle, and it does kind of latch into the slot and requires a bit of force to remove (I struggled a bit to get it out of my laptop). The battery life feels pretty good and it comes with a type C cable for charging or wired connectivity (saddly no charging dock here).The sensor in the mouse is a proprietary one that steelseries owns, and I have to say its quite awesome. I really like using the mouse with my laptop in bed, as I have had accurate tracking on all of the surfaces I have tried. Compared to some of the other wireless mice I have used like the logitech g502, this thing is a godsend for wanting to laze about comfortable. The mouse is also VERY light, but has a nice center of gravity so its easy to control in your hand. This does feel like a premium peripheral.Bottom line, I do like this mouse. I had mentioned in my review of their APEX keyboard that I wished they had made a MMO mouse so that when I try to fully integrate into their ecosystem I would actually have a mouse. Felt like fate that not long after this mouse came out. Time will tell if I can actually gain full efficiency with the buttons on the side as I think they just need a little more refinement to be perfect, and it ended up being more of an add on to an already well designed regular mouse, than designed with them from the ground up. While the premium feel is very nice, I don't think this is a 150$ mouse, I got mine on the first sale where it dropped to 90$ which is closer to what I would recommend it at.So if you are like me and can't stand the defect rate from Razer products anymore, and are able to shill out a bit more to try a new imperfect yet fairly nice device then go for it. If not, and want to wait to see how it holds up then Redragon and Utech are pretty good cheap brands, if you are into modding I heard the logitech one is easy to upgrade, and Corsairs is quite popular as well. Will update if this mouse has any other glaring issues or if my daily driving yields good fruits."", ""Wow.....this is a great mouse!! I didn't expect to like it so much, but it's pretty great! Definitely killing it in the lightweight department, competing with the MM710 from Cooler Master for sure. The button clicks are muuuuch better than Steelseries' Sensei 310, Sensei Ten, and Rival 3, at least in my opinion. These feel like they will last 5+ years and still feel clicky & responsive. The scroll wheel however is almost exactly the same as those other Steelseries mice, which is okay but slips a little between notches every now & then and isn't the most crisp. It feels better than the other mice, with the scroll wheel being a little more accurate, but not as much as I would hope. The buttons do feel a little too easy to press and not as resistant as my mouse that I am replacing, the Razer Abyssus Essential. I'd give this a solid 8/10; if this mouse was slightly shorter length-wise and the scroll wheel & buttons improved, it would be a 10/10."", ""I've only had my hands on this mouse for a few hours at this point, so I can't truly speak to how good or bad the battery life is. However, my initial impression is that this mouse more than serves its purpose.Regarding the SteelSeries GG/Engine functionality, I can safely say that the range of customization options, both for RGB and for the actual hardware, are expansive enough to leave even the most finicky of performance tweakers' content.For the accessories, I have a bit of an issue with the USB-C 2.4 GHz dongle. I'm using this mouse on a laptop with a single USB port, and having the dongle in said port effectively blocks me from using the adjacent USB-A port and one of the audio jacks. While using the mouse over Bluetooth is a solution, that does reduce some of the functionality, and felt like it introduced a bit of latency. The extender and braided USB-A to USB-C cable used to connect to the extender AND charge the mouse are pretty high quality and are honestly an expected inclusion for a mouse like this.For actual gameplay usage, the mouse does its job well. My only complaint is that in exchange for the iconic lightweight design the Aerox line offers, I'm making some sacrifices. I primarily purchased this mouse so that I don't have to steal my Logitech G600 from my desktop while using my laptop to play my favorite MMO. But the bulky G600 has a feature I'm having trouble to adapting to the Aerox 9 lacks: The third click button that when pushed in conjunction with the side keys, inputs them with the Control key modifier (1 becomes Ctrl+1, etc.). The reduced weight, better portability, and wireless functionality is a worthwile trade off, I feel, but this may not be the case for you if you are accustomed to having that ease of access in MMOs.Finally, we come to my main sticking point with the Aerox 9. The ergonomics. They are *mostly* flawless... With one glaring issue. When using the side keys, my thumb rests nicely on the second row where they have a nice nub to indicate where you are on the keys. But to reach the *top* row requires me to stretch and slightly rotate my hand in order to get a sure feel for which key I'm pushing and to reliably do so. This can be mitigated somewhat by resting your hand slightly higher up on the mouse, but this also takes away from the good shape of the mouse somewhat. If SteelSeries ever does a refresh on the design, I encourage them to look into bringing the side keys back towards the bottom of the mouse maybe even just two or three millimeters.In the end, I feel like this mouse can give you what you need if you are looking for a wireless MMO mouse, being one of the only ones available from a major, reputable brand that I've found. The mouse's software gives you full range to customize it to your needs, and the lightweight design makes most other MMO mice feel like bricks by comparison. The ergonomics issue can be overcome with adapting how you hold it somewhat, and it trades some functionality for the lightweight design. The dongle's width should be a non-issue for most users, and the accessories included are of a high quality. I do feel like I could safely recommend this mouse to a friend who needs a MMO mouse that has to be wireless, and perhaps even if they're just more accustomed to lightweight, low-profile mice than the monster-sized mice that most MMO mice are.*I may update this review down the line once I've gotten more experience with it."", ""The mouse overall is a great value and has great performance. The only problem that I can see is with the MMO buttons on the side of the mouse. The weight of the mouse is great, especially if you are buying this because you fell in love with the Logitech g703, but found the logitech g604 didn't have enough buttons. This mouse is great, unless you are someone who uses a claw grip on a mouse. Then the first six buttons are far too forward to be of use. Luckily for me, I play Diablo 4, and only use 6 skill buttons, so I just opened the very easy to use (far better than iCue) to remap the buttons to use last six buttons for 1-6 instead. Problem solved. But if you play WoW, or another game that needs all 12 buttons, you may have problems, unless you have unusually long fingers, or use a palm grip on your mouse. I'm still using this, but I can't help but go back to my Corsair Scimitar, and pray for a wireless version. But don't get me wrong, this is the best MMO wireless mouse, better than the Corsair Ironclaw, or the Logitech g604."", ""I've used an MMO mouse since around 2010 including the Razor Naga, Logitech G600, and Corsair Scimitar. I was excited when I saw a lightweight and wireless alternative since MMO mice are generally very bulky and heavy. With this I could play also be more comfortable playing other games that benefit from lighter mouse movement like FPS and Mobas and even OSU.UNFORTUNETLY the side buttons on this thing are absolutely awful and need work. I read reviews and saw people complaining but figured it couldn't be that bad.My main issue is the 1-3 buttons (ESPECIALLY NUMBER 3) toward the front of the mouse. They are not at a flat angle with the other buttons if that makes sense. It's like they are angled outward with the curve of the front of the mouse. I find myself subconsciously using my keyboard for 1-3 rather than the mouse because it's just easier. I've even been considering remapping 1,2 ,3 to actually be 4,5,6 and just not using the first 3 buttons. They are really that bad. With that being said, buttons 4 ,5 ,6 , 7, 8, 9 are alot easier to press. They are more flat and in a good spot on the mouse. This might all be a personal grip and hand size problem? I dont know. These are not problems I've had with other MMO mice. I have average sized male hands with a palm grip.The buttons are also very hard to press. You have to really put some force on them compared to other MMO mice. Which is fine... But because it's such a lightweight mouse alot of the force just ends up moving the mouse and I end up jittering my camera or character movement slightly with button presses. (Especially with buttons 1-3...)I really wanted to enjoy this mouse. And I do ... But at this point I'd rather buy an actual wireless and lightweight FPS mouse and have a Razor Naga on the side for MMOs and WoW.For just a wireless gaming mouse, I've very much enjoyed it. No complaints. But for MMOs the buttons on the side are terrible and I would very much consider this issue when buying this mouse."", ""Been using it less than a day, but I wanted something to replace my Logitech MX 1000 which I've been using for 20 years and had 10 buttons. The SteelSeries software is painfully slow, even on an M1, and takes about a minute to open fully. Even though the Mac recognizes the mouse by name, the SS software doesn't; either via Bluetooth or RF dongle.I have also been using USB Overdrive for about 20 years since Logitech also has crappy Mac support. I used the dongle interface first, but USB OD didn't recognize any of the thumb buttons to program them (it did recognize all of the top buttons, including the scroll rocker, which is what I use for back and forward delete). Switching to the BT interface, it recognized all the buttons (who knows why). Now I'm launching apps, hitting return, closing windows, deleting, refreshing, changing directory, etc. on my M1 without having to take my left hand off the home row.So far, so good!"", 'Pros:lighter than any mouse I\'ve had before12 side buttonsbattery life actually better than expected since advertised battery life on most devices tend to be much higher than reality, can use all day with rgb lights on without needing to stop to plug it inthe cable for the dongle extension is the same cable for the mouse so if you don\'t have an extra usb-c you don\'t need to get another (unless you really hate unplugging your dongle)Cons:needed to update the firmware about 50 times before it was completely up-to-date, before firmware updates wouldn\'t keep any settings and would have to readjust them in app. Each firmware update took a decent amount of time and they wouldn\'t automatically update when not in use so the app needs to be opened(at least their app is simple). Updating the firmware of the mouse and the dongle has to be done separately, it won\'t update mouse firmware while the dongle is plugged into the computerWhen switching from wireless to wired or vice-versa the mouse takes about 10-15 seconds to connect and you need to change the switch on the bottom of the mouse to do so, during this time (in my experience) there is also a couple of seconds where my keyboard is disabled.The scroll wheel would squeak (when scrolling obviously) but is squeaking much less lately, not sure what could be causing the squeak but maybe it\'s just the rubbery material of the wheel rubbing against an internal component.The scrolling is a little sensitive for my preferences as there are some games that use the middle mouse click for an action and use scrolling for another action (I\'ve had to change some controls to avoid mis-inputs)The more technical info:Completely reprogrammable (with steelseries GG app) including macros.Middle mouse click (on scroll wheel) has tilt left and right as well as non-tilt clickStill functions as a mouse without the app, however some additional features may not work without it meaning if you\'re buying this mouse you\'ll want to download the free app but for setup purposes and navigating BIOS when you need to you don\'t need an additional mouseYou can have the rgb completely off if you prefer, but you can completely customize what color(s) the lights are, how fast it changes color, brightness, breathing on/off and speed, color change order, and a ""reactive"" option meaning when you press a button on the mouse it can pulse your choice of color. The lighting also has the option for 3 zones to customize or just set the whole mouse to the same settings.Your generic wireless mouse is roughly 3/4 the length and 2/3 the width of this mouse while being noticeably heavier than this mouseMoves smoothly on hard surface and mouse/desk pad so if you take it with your laptop or just don\'t have a pad it isn\'t 100% necessary for ease of use (but still preferred for the sake of keeping debris out of the mouse)The DPI switch can save up to 5 options (can also remove options in case you use fewer) ranging from 100-18000 (completely customizable within that range) and cycles through options with 1 button', ""After about a month of use, I can confirm this mouse is legit except for the battery life that lasts only about 40 hours of heavy MMO use in 2.4Hz connection without RGB. If RGB is turned on, I think this mouse will last only about 12 hours. I’ve had one other MMO mouse before, G600, and I like the Aerox 9 a lot more though G600 had angled buttons to allow users to find the buttons easier in the beginning. Side button positions and layout is just as good on both mouse. It’s about the same difficulty of pushing side buttons. In the most comfortable grip, my thumb finds 4-9 naturally, but 1-3 and 10-12 is not a problem to push. Since Aerox 9 is much lighter than the G600 and has no cable connection, it is easier to maneuver in my hand and find those 1-3 and 10-12. The mouse also is not humongous like some people make it out to be. I am 5ft 9 and have a fair sized hand. My hand is definitely not big for my size. When I put the mouse under my hand in natural comfortable grip, I have a small wiggle room between my wrist and the end tail of the mouse. I don't play game in this comfy grip tho. I put my wrist as close to the tip of the mouse tail so thumb is close to side button 1,2,3 as it allows moving the mouse around more accurately. However, like I said, the mouse is so light, it is easy to tilt/move inside my hand so finding numbers 7-12 isn't a problem. The click sensation is very nice and there is no latency issue at all. Zero.The real problem of this mouse is the Steelseries Engine software and the customer service. One time, I asked a few questions to the company and it took them 10+ days to reply. The DPI adjustment is only available in 100 increment. A 50 increment up and down would have made a world of difference for me, but the software can only do 100 plus or minus, so fine tuning is not the best. The mouse also does not go back to normal button configuration setup once you engage a game connected to the Engine software. If you start a game bind to the custom button configuration via Engine, the button configuration will stay in a game setup even after the PC turned off and turned back on. I had to open the Engine software to go back to my normal web browser button setup.One tip. Get a  magnetic USB-C connector + cable for charging. It’s much easier to connect the charger that way. The charging port is positioned a little hard to connect, but with magnetic dongle and cable snaps right in."", 'Sai de um Sensei Pro Grade para um aerox 9. o encaixe da mão ficou o mesmo, vi relatos de pessoas que falavam de um certo atraso no mouse quando usado sem o fio. eu não tive esse atraso funciona 100% nada contra.... Um detalhe, eu fui ativar ele pelo código da caixa e não consegui pois dizia que o código já tinha sido usado, demais nada contra.', ""This mouse is light as a feather when unplugged. However it only lasts about 2 days of gaming before you have to plug it back in. I just forget it's plugged in, but when it's unplugged, man it feels agile.I have all the thumb keys mapped to the NUM PAD. Makes things a bit easier. The macro functions are easily added.RGB is quite useless, good to tell you when your battery is low? But otherwise kinda useless as there's no RGB in the skeletonized section.I have somewhat smaller hands, reaching the forward 6 buttons is a chore and requires me to have my hand further up. But that's not my comfortable mouse posture, which is more a claw grip. Palm gripping your mouse is weird.This is also one of the very few Steelseries mice that have a tilting scroll wheel, I was excited to have that back after having the Rival 5 for a year. However, it's extremely stiff, enough that you more than likely will click the scroll wheel instead of tilt it. So that's a bummer.DPI Settings were a big PITA to setup for the first few days... I'll post a pic of my settings to help you adjust easier... I also loathed that I had to make a macro for browser Back and Forward shortcuts, however the benefit was the ability to put those exactly where it was comfortable for me. Shortcuts are as follows for that:Open Macro EditorRecording for Browser Back: ALT + Left ArrowRecording for Browser Forward: ALT + Right ArrowClick setting on each one (bottom left) as No Delay.It will not work in Explorer half the time, so browsing through files will require adjustment.My final con... Profiles. Notice how I said I have all 12 thumb keys assigned to the NUM PAD and then I had mapped forward and back keys for browsing the web... Yep. Profiles. You'll have to swap profiles for gaming and productivity. Makes me wonder if I can set a macro on the Apex Pro to switch easily... I'll update this if I ever decide to test that out.Overall, I recommend this mouse if you want a MOBA mouse and want to keep all your gear Steelseries.""]"
‎B099MR91RP,"Razer Strider Hybrid Mouse Mat with a Soft Base & Smooth Glide: Firm Gliding Surface - Anti-Slip Base - Rollable & Portable - Anti-Fraying Stitched Edges - Water-Resistant - XXLarge,Black",Accessories,S$74.43,https://www.amazon.sg/Razer-Strider-Hybrid-Mouse-Smooth/dp/B099MR91RP/ref=sr_1_63?dd=XxiCC2ZWJEAm8lrakuHHqw%2C%2C&qid=1695850881&refinements=p_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%2Cp_36%3A2000-%2Cp_90%3A6832965051&rnid=6450031051&s=computers&sr=1-63,https://www.amazon.sg/Razer-Strider-Hybrid-Mouse-Smooth/product-reviews/B099MR91RP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,4.7,"['I\'m coming from several years on the Logitech PowerPlay system. My new metal desk renders the wireless charging moot (hence getting a new mat to reduce wire clutter and to try something new), and I\'ve been through a half dozen extras of the included G240 cloth mat, buying replacements around twice a year.The Razer Strider is a hybrid mat - somewhere between having the smooth, speedy glide of a hard surface, and the relatively high friction and precision of a cloth mat. I\'d say 40% of the former and 60% of the latter for this mat specifically. So far, it\'s been a smooth transition coming from pure cloth (I imagine coming from a purely hard surface style mat would be more jarring).It\'s also my first time on a ""desk cover"" style mat, where you\'re meant to host your entire kbm setup on top of the mat with any other accessories that can justify being nearby. I\'m happy with the look, and a big plus is that there\'s much more real estate for the mouse - the G240 wasn\'t exactly spacious, and the real estate here feels enormous by comparison. There\'s enough to arrange your setup in all kinds of ways and still have more than enough room dedicated to mouse use. It\'s slightly different coming from a smaller pad, which you\'d normally position first then kind of position everything else ""around"" it. Having a larger pad that can host a variety of tech means the overall setup process is more holistic and integrated rather than isolated around different zones, if that makes sense.One thing that surprised me - the premium feel that started from unboxing the thing and getting it set up on my desk. It was rolled pretty tight but laid perfectly flat with no raised areas or persistent curls. Zero wrinkles, zero creases to speak of. It can\'t be overstated how *nice* that is. Even the Logitech hardmat included with the Powerplay system had a persistent curve that took several weeks to hammer down (which I never had the patience to sit through, which was a major factor in sticking to their cloth mats since they come packaged flat), and the cloth mats would curl or develop a crease for hours if you needed to roll them up for any reason. As mentioned before, I also had to replace them regularly - the sides would fray and unravel relatively quickly, and repeated cleanups to wipe off pet hair and debris would marr and eventually discolor the surface (not chemically, but texturally there\'d be those lighter areas from wiping small sections of the material in different directions). A closeup shot showcases the quality of the surface and stitching.An extremely minor nitpick (more against certain video reviews than against the mat itself) - a lot of video reviews claim that the stitching on the edges is low profile enough that you can\'t feel them gliding the mouse over the edges of the pad. I disagree, at least based on my mouse model (G502 X Plus). There\'s a subtle but very noticeable tactile bump if you happen to move your mouse over the stitching. It\'s not jarring per se, but it *will* mess up your aim if you\'re in the middle of a tense 1v1 aim duel in, say, Valorant. Interestingly enough, Razer in its own marketing and on the box make zero claims about precision being uninterrupted by the stitching, so there\'s no reason to hold this against them. The bottom line is it\'s quite subtle, but expect it to affect moment to moment precision. For me personally, I appreciate having a gentle reminder to reposition my mouse, and on my previous pad, I never really had problems accidentally gliding off, and the available surface was much smaller.One less minor nitpick is that the surface has more of a texture to it compared to pure cloth mats. While not as ""hard edged"" as hard mats, it\'ll be noticeable. So if you have sensitive skin, you might want to think about getting something like wrist gaiters to alleviate. For me, it\'s not a problem.So this mat represents the best of both worlds - it has a glide reminiscent of a hardmat, but also retains a lot of the precision and control of a cloth mat. Like pure hardmats, it\'s water resistant and so far seems resilient, leaving no marks after vigorous wiping, but is also flexible and can be rolled up for transport with zero fear of developing persistent curls or creases. Strong recommend if you\'re interested in a hybrid style surface.', 'This mousepad is excellent. It’s a nice, large mousepad, it stays in place, it’s perfectly smooth and blends well with the rest of my setup. The only problem is that with the mousepad being all black, it is very prone to showing any sort of dust and/or gamer gunk that naturally accrues.

So while technically phones are computers now, this was what I needed to make my iPhone feel more like a *real* computer. :)On the negative side I have only two criticisms:1. I had to research how to turn it on and pair it with my phone online.  There is a manual in size 0.007 microfont (if you can do ultra-fine print), but I had to YouTube it lol).  But the lack of a power switch made it a bit confusing, and what I could make out of the instructions was in Broken English, a language I don\'t speak fluently.  Sadly that is becoming the standard, with so many things like this being made in foreign countries, so I guess it\'s not that big a deal.  I just wish it had a link to some online docs or something.  They could have just printed their website, in ordinary-size human-readable text, and left out all the other tiny-finy mini-text trying to cram a manual in there (lol).2. As a touch-typist, the keyboard layout is aggravating, to say the least.  They did some very... well let\'s just say ""unconventional"" things to save space.  It kind of reminds me of a Commodore or some other early model home computer, from back before keyboards had a standard layout.  I have the same issue with my VIC-20.  And if I had an Atari or a BBC Micro or something, I bet those keyboards would be weird by today\'s standards too.But having said that, I really like being able to carry around a keyboard with me anywhere I go.  If having a tactile keyboard is something you want, this is definitely worth a look.  Once you get past the bizarre layout and some of its other quirks, it\'s totally usable.  I\'d take it over an on-screen keyboard any day!', ""Technically speaking, this keyboard is great. I got exactly what I expected to get: seamless connection and keystrokes, excellent battery life, in a very sturdy and portable little frame. I can't use the included stand because my phone case is too thick, but I knew that when I bought it, and my phone case has its own built-in stand so that's worked fine. I do wish the keyboard could snap into position or something, rather than needing a flat surface to rest on to maintain its shape.I really thought it would come in handy more than it has, though -- it seems the more effective method for me is to transfer the heavy typing work to my computer. The size of it does mean my fingers get really cramped after extended use (and I have pretty small hands), and it's all too easy to hit the wrong key. It also isn't programmed with the same keybinds as my regular keyboard, which tripped me up a lot.Overall, good keyboard, best I've seen in this scale, just didn't end up working out for me.""]"

I picked up a USB A extension cable and haven\'t had a problem since. It probably works great for those with forward-facing or front USB ports, but buying the extension cable has made this work the way I needed it to.The trackpad is pretty good, too. It won\'t always get you across your screen, but I didn\'t expect it to for its size. Expect to find yourself in some awkward finger combinations as you try to use certain key-combos if you use this on a computer, but since it\'s so small, this can usually be done quite easily.I couldn\'t make this work very well with my Philips Android TV or LG webOS TV, which was my original intention (typing a password or URL on a TV browser sucks!) The Android TV didn\'t seem to recognize the trackpad taps while in app that wasn\'t a web browser. On the webOS TV, typing on the mini keyboard would cause the system to freak out between text boxes, not knowing if it should get input from this device or the remote. I didn\'t have the patience for it after a couple of hours and that\'s when I figured out its new use.It\'s worked mostly great, but there was a day where two buttons would repeat their characters 5-6 times when pressed (""C"" and ""X"" in this instance).

It\'ll get the job done, but you won\'t be typing 150wpm!2 - Since I was only 15 feet away from my computer and there was so much interference that it didn\'t work well, I needed to buy an extension cable.', ""I have gone through a lot of these style of remotes.

The keyboard keys have just the right amount of resistance (for me anyways), but they are not loose or wobbly nor have to be pressed ""just right"" like a lot of other mini keyboards I\'ve tried. I\'ve tried a LOT of similar style mini keyboards for my HTPC computers and the X8 definitely has the highest quality keys/buttons of all of them. They keys are that kind of softish rubbery type material that is common on higher price tier devices. They don\'t feel cheap or wonky.The back light, a feature sorely missing from most mini keyboards, I think is just right. There are a few colors to cycle thru. None of the colors are vibrant or rich but they do the job and, perhaps most importantly, are not too bright, so as to be distracting during a movie and draw too much from the battery.The touchpad is just a skoosch better than most of the other comparable devices I\'ve tried. I think they all use the exact same hardware for the TouchPad, but the X8 has a bit of a textured feel that somehow make it feel just a little easier to be precise. Like the back light, the touchpad does its job adequately.The wheel:  What sets the Rii X8 apart from anything else I\'ve seen is the scroll wheel.I already have a multitude of mini keyboards and wasn\'t even looking for one, but saw the X8 by chance in Amazon recommended and had to try the scroll wheel.What a fantastic thing they\'ve done here. It\'s a total game changer for the mini-keyboard market, IMO. I think most people who have tried using mini keyboards full time for HTPC (or anything else) would probably agree with me that what ultimately kills the experience with these is trying to scroll. I\'ve bought so many of this and similar style mini keyboards with integrated touchpad, just trying to find one that had good - or even decent and consistent, two finger scrolling. After so many fails, I just gave up and use a trackball and mini keyboard with one HTPC and a Logitech K400 for another. (both without back light, I might add)The scroll wheel on the X8 effectively solves the primary delimma of almost every other device in this class. I can now scroll thru Netflix, Hulu, etc, with ease - while having a backlit keyboard and not needing to reach for a second device.(FWIW, I\'ve been using the X8 with my Kubuntu HTPC, using web apps for streaming services.)It\'s only been two weeks, but I feel comfortable saying this is easily the best mini keyboard with integrated touchpad that I\'ve ever bought. If there was a mid or upper-mid tier class of mini keyboard, the X8 (at this price point) would be punching up at that class.', ""Don't get me wrong, this little thing is great but you can't change the color except to cycle through a few preset colors or the rainbow display.

Great value for money though and the rechargeable battery can easily be replaced to extend it's useful life."", 'I have this one and the i4. They each have their plusses and minuses but the layout of the i4 seems a bit better. Nonetheless, Rii keyboards are fantastic and extremely useful for all sorts of purposes. I suggest using the included wireless receiver rather than bluetooth.', 'I\'ve owned several of this type of device over the last few years and this is one of the better ones overall.That said it is not perfect.I\'m not fond of the right & left mouse buttons being semi-squishy face buttons.They should have been solid plastic shoulder buttons like every other model.Shoulder buttons are just easier to press and to press in combination with other buttons.With the mouse buttons being face buttons I find that various key combinations that with other units are very easy to accomplish are in fact much more challenging with this unit.I also don\'t like the firmness of all of the face buttons in general.They are semi-squishy but still too stiff to the point that typing is less pleasant and more of a chore than necessary.I\'ve had cheaper units with buttons that were softer, felt better, and allowed for more comfortable typing.I am also disappointed at the lack of key rollover.I consistently find that when typing words with 2 of the same letter in a row that the second letter almost always gets missed.Words like ""look"" end up as ""lok"" unless I am paying a lot of attention and deliberately slowing my typing speed for that word.This keyboard desperately needs something like n-key rollover to solve this issue.The lack of a print screen button or function combination is also disappointing.The battery life of this unit is also shorter than I would like.It\'s not drastically shorter than other similar models but I have had some units that lasted longer before needing a recharge.That said the battery life of all the various units I\'ve tested is less than I would like so take this more as a statement that the battery life could be better rather than it is terrible.My final major complaint is the battery indicator.I\'ve found that this unit does not do a very good job of letting me know when the battery is low.I\'ve had multiple occasions where I\'m using the keyboard and all of a sudden it just goes dead.If there is any kind of a low battery warning it is very unnoticeable.I\'ve had other units that make it very clear and obvious with blinking lights and even start using a clear power save mode where the unit works but shuts off quickly after there has been no activity for 2-3 seconds.This preserves the battery and gives a relatively long period of time where I can still use the unit but am very aware that it is in need of a recharge.Now, the things I did like.The scroll wheel is by far the best part of this unit.Every other maker of small wireless keyboards should be including this feature, it makes a huge difference over having to use the trackpad to scroll.The scroll wheel could be slightly more precise as I have run into a few circumstances where when viewing a video I tried to move forward or backward in the video with the scroll wheel and the video jumped farther than intended.This is something that does not happen with a standard mouse scroll wheel, so if the scroll wheel\'s digital interpretation of the wheel being turned could be tightened up a bit that would make this feature pretty much perfect.I also like the overall shape of the device, it\'s curved in all the right places to feel comfortable when held.The build quality of the shell is also nice compared to some of the other unit\'s I\'ve used.The only thing that might be an improvement here is, I\'ve had some units that had a sort of velvety feel to the shell and that would be a nice addition to this unit.That said it\'s a minor thing and not the most critical part that needs improvement.The shell feel is entirely reasonable and not off putting.I also like the multiple lighting options, especially the tri color mode.However, the dark blue mode could be improved a bit.I find that with this lighting mode, about every other key is slightly dimmer than the others, to the point that the dimmer keys are harder to read.I really like that color but the key lighting for dark blue mode needs to be evened out & maybe brightened slightly so it is more usable.It would also be great to have the option of picking the colors and color positions for tri color mode rather than just having one pre-selected option.I don\'t know how doable that is but it would be a nice upgrade.All in all, until something better comes along, I do recommend this unit over most others.The scroll wheel alone is worth it.I would only warn someone away if they can\'t tolerate the face mouse buttons as that is a notable difference from other units and is a definite downside, though not a crippling one.', 'i am pc userpros :The keyboard is small in size and light in weight. It has rich keys. The scroll wheel is comfortable. The connection speed is fast. Sleep mode saves power.cons:The keyboard keys are hard, the touchpad is not perfect, and there are no shortcut keys for forward and return to web pages.', ""The range is a little shorter than I'd like but I bought it mainly for the backlight and the scroll wheel which work great""]"

I have been using this set for a week already, no issues so far and thinking to leave a review for those who are also looking out to buy the keyboard and mouse set.I ordered this set and it arrived in 2 days in very good packaging. The setup process is very easy, only one usb receiver is needed and you can use both mouse and the keyboard. I am using a WINDOWS 10 machine, no driver needs to be installed. After plug in the usb receiver and in about 2-3 mins, I am able to use the mouse and keyboard.

They all take AA batteries, 2 for keyboard and 1 for the mouse. You don't need a mouse pad to use it together with the mouse, it can slide easily around the tabletop.The keyboard is very sleek and pretty, giving you a well-made look & feel. The sound of the keyboard is just nice, not too loud. The color on the keyboard is silver for the base and white for the key. The keyboard has a number pad also.I would recommend this set and overall i am happy about this purchase."", 'It’s the mouse that keeps giving me trouble. I’ve changed to fresh batteries but it stopped working after a while. I had to continuously click off and on again', 'The delivery was on time. The keyboard is beautiful, and easily to press. The mouse is comfortable to maneuver and very silence when you “click” it. There are two things for improvement: 1. The keyboard keys such as  “backspace” and arrow keys are not quite compatible to Mac Laptop users because the space between them are too narrow, I kept pressing the key next to them. 2. The keyboard and mouse dongle receiver is too tide slotted in the storage space inside the mouse, I have difficulty taking them out.', 'I really like the design of the mouse and it is really quiet with the clicking. However, the keyboard is a little disappointing as the typing sound can get quite loud (keys are a little stiff) although it is slightly better than the normal keyboard. Disadvantage of this set is the color being white, it gets dirty easily. The keys are also placed a little differently from other keyboards so will need a little time to get used to. Height of the keyboard can\'t be adjusted so will need to put something underneath to prop it up. What I love most about this set is that it uses only one USB port to connect both devices. The keyboard uses 2 AA batteries while the mouse needs only one. The keyboard will automatically go into sleep mode within about 10 seconds but it ""awakes"" immediately once a key is hit. The keyboard itself has a function key which is very useful for laptops if the lid is closed when in use. Above are some information that I hope is useful to anyone looking to get a keyboard and mouse set.Overall the design of both keyboard and mouse are cool and I\'m satisfied with this purchase!Edit June 01st, 2021: Bought this in November 2020 and used it for a couple of weeks before I gave my review above. But about three or four months later I had a slight problem with the mouse (left click button is not as sensitive anymore) but I left it as that. In May the left click button is totally not functioning anymore. Wrote directly to seller using the email they provided when they send the product and through amazon about a replacement but no reply from seller to date. I loved this product but the after-sales service is extremely bad. Would not recommend if you\'re looking for support after you get the product otherwise the keyboard and mouse are a really nice combo.', 'Love the slim profile of the keyboard. Absolutely love the mouse too. Probably one of the best mouse I’ve used, and probably better than the popular L brand. Works so silently and nice to hold, I’ve gotten comments bout how satisfying it! :)I like the keyboard’s minimalist profile yet raised profile too. Takes up little space. Very lightweight. Keys are springy and makes clickety clack sounds when typing. Haha. Even though I must say, one of my keys did pop out after travelling in my bag. But easily put back. I don’t mind the quality for this price. Bought a cheaper keyboard+mouse set from shoppee but I’m a lot more satisfied with this.  Thanks seller and Amazon!']"

I\'ve gone more in depth on the different aspects of the keyboard below, however the tl;dr is that at this price point you can\'t beat this keyboard.  It\'s fantastic for travel (at least I imagine it will be, currently can\'t travel due to the pandemic), it\'s light and it responds every bit as well as a wired normal keyboard.  I highly recommend it.Ease of Setup: 5/5This literally took me 10 seconds to connect, all I had to do was turn it on, hit the connect button, and then it easily showed up in my Bluetooth pairing options as ""bluetooth keyboard""Ease of Use: 5/5I do have to admit this keyboard took me about 15 minutes to get used to, however it wasn\'t nearly as long as I thought it would.  This is because despite being a smaller keyboard, the actual key size lines up nearly perfectly with a standard keyboard.  Attached is a picture for reference of my standard keyboard with the ProCase keyboard next to it, and if you notice the actual keys are lined up nearly perfectly.  The space is saved by eliminating the number pad and moving around some of the other buttons like the delete key, arrows etc.  Really, the only problems I have had so far come from the windows key and ctrl key on the right side being moved, however those are truly minor problems and if in order to get a smaller keyboard you obviously have to sacrifice something.  I think that this keyboard chose exactly the right things to change while leaving the most important part (the letter keys) the same.Functionality: 5/5Everything works as it should so far.  It\'s possible I suppose that due to my limited usage there is something that doesn\'t work or that I\'ve missed, but I doubt it at this point.  I think if anything was broken, I would have discovered it after using it as much as I have.Other:This keyboard is exactly what I was hoping for in a travel bluetooth keyboard.  I probably won\'t be using it day to day for work as I need my number pad for that, however it\'s much lighter and easier to take with me than a full keyboard is, and it has the benefit of easily being able to pair to my laptop as well as my tablet, and I would use this keyboard over the default laptop keyboard any day of the week, and especially on a tablet.  I also think this keyboard is great for those with limited desk space as it takes up about 2/3rds the space of a normal keyboard without sacrificing the functionality.  My biggest concern when purchasing it was whether I would have to essentially relearn where the keys were since I\'ve been touch typing for my entire life, however transitioning from this keyboard to a standard keyboard and back again has really been no problem, I can\'t recommend it enough.', 'El teclado es de buen tamano y tiene la mayoria de teclas necesarias para  trabajar como desarrollador.

For example, the distance between the center of adjacent keys is never mentioned, even though this particular measurement is what determines whether or not a keyboard will provide maximum typing agility as provided by the standard size keyboard. This distance is 19.5 mm on the standard keyboard.  The term “mini keyboard” has been introduced to connote “portability,” where the numeric keypad has been removed, AND where – in some cases but not all – the keys are also smaller.  Removing the numeric keypad, and the keys to the immediate right of the letter keys, significantly reduces the size of the keyboard, but taking the extra step of making the keys smaller seems to offer little more advantage in portability while at the same time creating a big DIS-advantage: a cramped, compromised typing experience.  I would expect “mini” keyboard to exclusively describe this inferior, cramped experience, but unfortunately “mini” is also used to describe keyboards having keys that are the full size and distance apart, 19.5 mm.  This makes shopping for a keyboard almost impossible, if one is to realize their expectations of typing nirvana, without any buying and returning.  It would make more sense if the industry simply described keyboards with full-sized keys but without the numeric keypads as portable, in which case “mini portable” would have the additional meaning of the keys being reduced and therefore cramped, which would be useful to those whose priority was extreme lightness, where one simply can not afford the extra baggage.  In which case a portable keyboard would be useful to anyone who simply wanted to reclaim some desk space without sacrificing typing agility – which is a lot of us – while at the same time being compact enough to pack in a small bag.  In fact it seems that such a portable keyboard would be small and lightweight enough even where extreme portability is essential – in which case the “mini portable” keyboard would be relegated as useless to literally anyone.  Because no matter how big or small the keyboard is generally, I need full-size keys.  And it’s amazing just how small the keyboard can be while maintaining full-size keys!  But without a standardized way to indicate these properties of a keyboard, what should be a simple thing becomes a journey, in which one needs to buy several keyboards to try for oneself.Along this journey I discovered that I might actually prefer a keyboard with keys as close as 17 mm apart (measured from the center of adjacent keys), as found on the Logitech Keys-to-go.  This is still much further apart than on all of the “mini portables.”  But it makes me think that even the standard keyboard should come in different sizes, since the size of our hands plays a big part in keyboard ergonomics.  This is ironic because I was the fastest typist ever in my high school, including my typing class and all previous years.  So you would think that the IBM Selectric was designed for someone with exactly my hands, but now I discover that 17mm is just as good or better?  Note that I wear a large size glove, and my hands are 19.2 cm, exactly average for an adult man (measured from the tip of the middle finger, across the palm, to the right side of the wrist).Now that keyboards come in different sizes, with no standard key size or spacing, other factors determine success with any one model: size of hands, Typing skill, the keyboard one is already accustomed to, and the extent to which a keyboard would be in the way when it’s not actually being used.With that in mind I’d like to compare 3 keyboards that I recently bought to use with my new iPad mini 4.  They all worked for the few days I was testing them side by side.  I kept the Logitech Keys-To-Go and returned the other two, mainly because the “keys-to-go” offers a full-size typing experience but is also whisper quiet.  It’s also practically weightless but that was not a factor in my decision to keep it, since my priority was whatever keyboard provides the best typing experience with my iPad mini 4.1. The Logitech Keys-To-Go Ultra-Portable Bluetooth Keyboard for iPad, Black (920-006701).  The keys are 17mm apart and is WHISPER quiet.  If you’re typing in bed and your spouse is already asleep this wouldn’t wake them.  This offers a “full-size” keyboard experience and also EXTREME portability.  Only if you have thick fingers might this not be a good choice, unless extreme portability is the priority.  The keys move downward about 1mm, but with no clickity-clack, more like a click as it might be heard through a layer of thin rubber, which is the case, so there is both a tactile and an auditory feedback, just much less than with a regular keyboard. Due to its unibody construction it’s quite durable and can be casually put on a bookshelf or in a backpack or suitcase, ready to grab when you need to do some real typing. Note that it’s not intended to replace the full-size keyboard you already use with your desktop computer.2. Logitech K810 – 19.5 mm between the center of adjacent keys, which lends itself to the FULL typing experience.  This is as noisy as, and possibly more than, a regular keyboard.  Nothing special, but it does look nice, so if noise isn’t an issue this would look very nice on your desk.  I would consider this to be a full-size, regular keyboard but that uses Bluetooth.  Could be a desktop replacement.3. Anker Ultra Compact Slim Profile Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard for iOS, Android, Windows and Mac.  19.5 mm between the center of adjacent keys, so calling it “ultra compact slim” is outrageously misleading, hence my call for a less subjective and more standardized nomenclature among keyboard manufacturers.  This is twice as noisy as the Logitech K810.  This is a noisy keyboard.  It made a thumping sound on the kitchen countertop.  If someone is typing on this in the next room you will hear them.  You can’t use this if someone in the house is trying to fall asleep or is sleeping.  Even the Logitech K810 makes above average noise for all keyboards but the Anker is twice as loud as this!The biggest difference among these three keyboards is the clickity-clack noise they make.  The Anker is just plain noisy.Of the three I kept the Logitech Keys-To-Go and returned the other two.  I would even consider getting a second Keys-To-Go, for the sake of being future-proof.  At $49, this seems like a very good price, considering it retails for $69 and higher elsewhere.  It seems like a “very good” keyboard for anyone who wants the full-size keyboard experience in a reduced form factor, and a “must have” if you travel a lot or only use a keyboard infrequently and prefer a really clean desktop.Hopefully this will make your keyboard buying decisions easier.', 'Excelente producto, como todos los de esta marca, una buena actualización de este teclado se siente muy suave su uso, ergonómico, moderno, súper portátil, comprado para uso con iPad se emparejó automáticamente, estoy muy satisfecho y calidad precio.', '(I did NOT receive this product for free or at a discount, like many reviewers somehow do. I paid full price, dangit!)A friend and I have been planning a month-long trip through Europe. My boss agreed to give me the days off IF I could be available to translate documents during the trip (i\'m a translator). I accepted the compromise, figuring that I could use my T-Mobile hotspot and WiFi at hostels to connect to the Internet. I thought about bringing my 15"" MacBook, but the darn thing is so heavy/expensive that I would hate to lug it around or leave it at a hostel. It was probably a better idea to bring my iPad instead. But, as anybody who\'s ever used an iPad\'s onscreen keyboard knows, it would be a pain in the butt to type long documents without a separate, physical keyboard.So I started doing my homework, researching all sorts of bluetooth keyboard cases and accessories. Some of them had excellent battery life. Others had a great feel to them. Others were really classy. Others were inexpensive. Others were super portable.But one... one of them had EVERYTHING. The Logitech Keys-To-Go. So I bought it. And it arrived the next day. And I used it. And....OMG.PROS:-It\'s ridiculously light and outrageously good-looking.-The clicking of the keys is comparable to a regular keyboard. I was afraid that it would feel like typing on a flat surface, with no feedback. But nope. It feels great.-The spacing of the keys is spot-on. I can type with about 90-95% the precision of a regular keyboard.-The back is a rubbery eraser-like material that, while not completely slip-proof, provides enough friction so that the keyboard won\'t move around.-Battery life claims to be a superb 3 months between charges (I\'ll update when I know for sure)-Bluetooth connection was quick to set up and has given me no problems so far (I\'ll update if anything changes)-The shortcut keys at the top are AWE-SOME. It has keys for home, multitask app picker, spotlight search, show/hide keyboard, camera, media controls (back, play/pause, skip), and volume. There is a problem with the Language key. See below for more information.CONS:-It\'s ridiculously thin. This makes me a little nervous about sticking it in a bag and traveling with it. (I\'ll update after my trip)-The Language key doesn\'t work. When you click the globe key, it\'s supposed to change the language of the keyboard. But instead it just takes you to spotlight search.  That\'s not Logitech\'s fault though. It\'s Apple\'s. With iOS 9, Apple changed the code for the language shortcut in bluetooth keyboards. But there is a workaround! Ctrl+Space will give you the language picker onscreen. Hopefully Apple will address this.-I may be wrong, but it seems like the battery on my iPad drains super quickly with the keyboard connected. (I\'ll update this if I notice something different)I am extremely happy with my purchase so far. I\'ll update this review after my trip, and hopefully it all turns out okay. For anybody who wants to type with tilde (accent marks) in Spanish, press option+E and then the letter you want to have a tilde (same shortcut works with OS X). Also, note that when you first connect the keyboard and select the Spanish language, the layout will be all wonky and you\'ll get symbols you don\'t want when you hit some keys. To fix this, go to Settings>General>Keyboard>Hardware Keyboard>Spanish and change it from SpanishISO to just Spanish. Then the keyboard should function just as you expect it to.TL;DRAfter much research, this seems to be the perfect portable keyboard to do work on an iPad during a month-long, lightly-packed trip to Europe. It has all the features and the looks that you want. Buy it.', 'Excelente teclado, le dura bastante la batería y se conecta inmediatamente', 'I am suffering from ALS, and my DVA-issued iPad is my constant companion, my only efficient means of communication. However, I don\'t want to drag both it and the computer around, this so I can work on writing articles while stuck at the hospital for an appointment.So, I went shopping for a keyboard, ideally one that would mate with the iPad as a cover. I tried out four different ones, but settled on this one for several reasons:* The weight. This little wonder is a featherweight compared to all of the others. Thin as an after dinner mint, it fits well in the Case Logic Case that I tote the whole affair in. Not as convenient as a hinged case cover keyboard, but easily half as light.* The operation. Like most other keyboards, it is charged through a USB to mini-USB cord. One control, an on-off slide switch. (The switch is well recessed in the edge of the \'rubberized fabric covered"" case.)* The comprehensiveness of the thing. In addition to the classic \'QWERTY"" arrangement, there is also a row of ""function-like"" keys above the number row, enabling one touch access to such iPad operations as pulling up the cameras, going to the home screen, search and God alone knows what for several of them. As there is virtually no documentation with your purchase, you have to figure those out by hit and miss. Also, you get an arrow key cluster, command, option and control keys, and a function key, although I have yet to test that out. The one thing missing here is a way to lock the keys into a numeric keypad configuration, something perhaps not in great demand with an iPad but still nice to have if it\'s available.* The key throw!!! On a keyboard of ¼"" thickness, Logitech has managed to provide keys tha actually have ""throw"". While not up to IBM Selectric standards, you still get positive feedback that you have hit the ""G"" key when you intended to.* The battery life. I\'ve bee using it pretty heavily for five day, and the indicator light still shows a full charge.Now for the (very few) \'negatives"":*The covering, while excellent as far as a protectice cover is concerned, does not have enough \'tack\' to hold it stationary under the impact of your piston-like fingers. On any surface other than a dead-flat surface, it will move and shift. Small patches of \'tacky\' material would overcome this easily.* Size. The keys at the margins have been scaled back, but you are still operating on a surface the size of the ancient Apple Newton system keyboard. But, it\'s unavoidable if you\'re going to scale a keyboard to the size of an iPad. Your hands enter the keyboard in a very tight arrangement, one that you need to learn to maintain. This too works against using the keyboard on a lap or anything other than a flat, stable table.* No carrying sleeve. However, the keyboard\'s surface takes storage in a carrying bag well.* The \'heat sealed\' edges of the keyboard. While efficient and done well, it give the board a \'cheaper\' feel.* The friggin\' Caps Lock key.  On a tight keyboard like this, providing a Caps Lock key without some means of disablement or locking it out altogether is a recipe for typing frustration for a touch typist. I have hated the Caps Lock key ever since the early 1950s, and I was sorry to see it here in classic form. Logitech, give us a way to null this key out!Would I buy it again? In a New York minute, without a doubt. But, if you take the plunge, make sure of your typing surface, or you will find yourself slip slidin\' away...', 'En mi opinión es excelente.

Growing up, I always took art classes and as long as the assignments didn\'t bore me, I did well.  Out of school, I didn\'t do any art for nearly a decade, until I discovered Art Academy on Wii U.  I followed the Art Academy series until Nintendo shut down Miiverse.  I moved to Discord for sharing art with friends, and discovered Ibis Paint X.I really like Ibis, but there\'s been one issue haunting me.  Any time and way I try to draw diagonal lines, the software makes the lines squiggly, or wavy.  I\'m not going to lie and say my hand is completely steady during drawing, but the waviness of diagonal lines was horrible.  As time went on, I drew less and less, hating the fact that any line that went diagonal, even a curve, would get wavy.I know this happens to others, I\'ve read about it on the Internet.  I\'ve spent the last half year trying different ways to resolve it.  Different tablets, low end and high end, on different versions of Android.  Different styluses, passive and powered.  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HELPED.  I even tried to reach out to the makers of Ibis Paint X for help.  They tried, but couldn\'t.To shorten the story a bit, I somehow stumbled across this tablet, as I looked for alternatives other than dumping $550 on a Galaxy Tab S6 or buying a new PC tablet and software to draw on my laptop.For only $40, THIS STOPPED MY WAVY/SQUIGGLY LINE PROBLEM!!You might be saying, ONLY $40?  To draw on a tablet?  That\'s a lot!  Remember, I was about to cough up for a high end Samsung tablet, which I don\'t really need, or a PC tablet for my laptop, which can\'t be moved since I use it for recording music.  So for me, this little guy was perfect.I apologize for my long story, but that\'s how stoked I am to have found a solution to my dilemma.  Now, onto my impressions about this tablet.Obviously, I don\'t have any issues with wavy lines using this.  As if writing this, I\'ve only used this with my six year old Huawei tablet, which is running Android 7.0, but I have a couple of other tablets to try this out on.  The tablet was plug and play.  I connected it to my Huawei, started Ibis, and started drawing.  That easy.For Ibis, I don\'t see an option to use the four shortcut buttons on the tablet, which is a bit of bummer but doesn\'t upset me.  You have a short list of presets to assign to the two buttons on the stylus, which feels good in my hand (I\'m a lefty, and wear a size 9 Large glove).  Using this tablet causes a PC style arrow cursor to show on my tablet screen.  While some may not like it, I do, since the tablet tracks the stylus even when you hover the stylus tip very close to the tablet without touching it.  It\'s easy to see where you\'re going to touch down.I intend to update this review as time goes on and I get to spend more time on this, on different devices.  I\'ll have to get some screenshots of the problem I described in my story as well, so others can see the difference this makes.  For now, I am ecstatic about this device and hope it lasts me for many years!  Back to art I go!UPDATE:  I\'ve added some screenshots to this review and will share my experience having had this tablet for a couple of years now.  Four out of the five screenshots are original art by me that was done using this graphics tablet.Take a look at the screenshot with the three pairs of lines.  This is an illustration of the issue that this tablet fixed. The first set of lines labeled ""ruler"" were drawn using Ibis Paint\'s ruler function, which forces perfectly straight lines.  The second set of lines illustrates the issue I was having.  See how wobbly the lines are?  I won\'t lie and say I have a perfectly steady hand, but this wobble in my lines is what made me stop doing art for so long.  Finally, the third trio of lines at the bottom were drawn by me using this tablet.  Again, you can see they aren\'t perfectly straight but they are much less wobbly than lines I drew via a stylus directly my Huawei tablet\'s screen.I\'ve done A LOT of art using this tablet and have used up four stylus nibs.  While this tablet\'s surface looks horribly scratched and scuffed, and has seen some moderate abuse from me taking this along with a Dragon brand tablet to work to doodle on breaks, it\'s drawing surface feels smooth to the touch and it has worked with every single tablet and PC I\'ve connected it to.As mentioned in the initial review, I have a laptop that basically is living as a desktop PC.  Said laptop is connected to a 32"" TV, so it kinda felt like I didn\'t have enough space to move on this tablet when I connected it to the laptop.  In the end, I wound up getting a bigger tablet from XP-Pen, which I\'m very happy with as well and keep as a dedicated surface for my laptop.All in all I\'m still very happy with both of my XP-Pen tablets, and am very happy that despite the heavy use and occasional abuse, this particular tablet still works like a champ!', ""Product is good, smooth to write ✍️ ,Compatible with laptop, desktop, mobile phone.A good buy.I'm satisfied😊"", 'El producto llegó a tiempo y en buenas condiciones, la calidad es muy buena tanto para principiantes y gente avanzada, sin duda una buena compra.', 'Me sorprende que no haya tantos análisis de la tableta por parte de artistas.Que los botones estén en el lateral ayuda con una mejor ergonomía que si estuviesen en la parte de arriba y las dimensiones del área para dibujar no sientes que te falte espacio para trabajar.

The software is easy to understand and use.It has a pretty good reading height. The shape and thickness is comfortable enough to use. There are no batteries involved. Pens shape is actually ok, in my opinion.Cons: The pen nib squeaks a lot with faster movements. Not the loudest squeaks, but it can get annoying. The pen that comes with the rev A has a strange texture to it. One of the feet/stoppers came off and are not very great quality. There is no hardware or software smoothing. You should get thirdparty drivers to enable software smoothing for a cleaner art experience."", 'Ótimo produto.', 'Great so far - didn\'t rate ""battery life"" because it doesn\'t apply to the product, it\'s powered by usb and the pen does not require a battery unlike my previous Wacom tablet which became a massive pain in my rear near the end of its life.Product is as described, very sensitive and pressure differentiation takes some getting used to but is great for sketching.Driver install seems to have caused a minor issue with my system. Since installing, whether or not the tablet is connected (just having the driver installed), my system will behave as if it is constantly receiving repeated right-arrow inputs until I tap one of the arrow keys, then it goes away. This needs to be done once every system boot, but my PC runs nearly 24/7 and as such this poses no real issue for me.Driver/software is otherwise pretty straightforward, and allows for custom profiles. I currently have 3, 1 for illustration and vector software, 1 for Osu! gameplay and 1 for general use.The pen on the 640S has a textured gripping area, an improvement considering by and far one of the biggest complaints about the 640 seems to be that the pen had no grip and would slip out of the hand easily. It\'s not extremely textured though, to be transparent - it\'s just slightly grippier than the rest of the pen body. It has yet to fall out of my hand, it survived 2 hours of Osu! with sweaty hands, I naturally hold near the flared tip of the pen and have had no problems with grip. Then again, I\'m a pleb so those playing more intense/competitive maps may find the grip insufficient.XP Pen is not stingy with their nibs either, including what looks like somewhere between 15-20 nibs with the product. Nice!Warranty is extensive, although I\'m one of those people who probably won\'t enroll for a few reasons which I\'ll refrain from bothering with. It\'s great that it\'s offered at this price though, as a show of confidence in their product.While the tablet itself does not feel military grade durable, you\'d be insane to expect that at this price point. I\'m very satisfied with the apparent build quality and feel like it will last long emough to pay for itself in use. It\'s very lightweight but sits firmly on flat surfaces due to the rubber feet on the underside. It doesn\'t seem to be built to take any sort of abuse, just take care of your belongings and it should be just fine.As with most tablets lacking screens, the surface will eventually show visible signs of wear where the pen makes contact with the top, but it\'s no complaint. Only way I can see avoiding that would be to spend $350+ on a screen tablet with gorilla glass or equivalent, but that\'s not what this product is competing with.With the 640S (this review to be clear, as the original 640 reviews are mixed in) the usb input is a 90 degree angled cable, which is a massive improvement over the straighf-out style of cable input.The customizable buttons feel quite cheap/weak/brittle, so I wouldn\'t go mashing on them hard. They do work well though, particularly useful when mapped to brush swaps and tools like smear, blur, polygon/line tools and eraser if you don\'t enjoy using the pen button for erasing (I really don\'t).Also included is a little pen holder tab which can be stuck to the underside of the tablet (or anywhere you want, really) and the pen can be slid through the protruding loop of material to be held in place. I installed mine so my pen attaches alongside the far edge of my tablet.The pen does become inactive when it is raised roughly 3/4"" or more from the surface, so those who have sporadic sketching habits will have to adjust, and those Osu! players who prefer the hover technique to dragging will probably need to adjust to the range for a little while. It took me about 20 minutes to get used to it, and it feels SO much better to me to play Osu! with this than with my mouse. I\'ve officially converted for good after 2 days of use.Another reviewer recommended using an open source tablet driver found on Github as oposed to XP Pen\'s, and after my little hiccups with the official driver on my system I also plan to switch and try that driver to see if it resolves my minor issues. I strongly recommend against windows built-in driver for tablets, I just haven\'t had any satisfaction with it between 3 different brands/models of tablets and either official or open source drivers are almost always superior.For what I paid, I\'m extremely pleased. Beats my previous wacom tablet in literally every regard, if it lasts long enough I\'ll be switching to XP Pen for all of my future needs. It\'s good for sketching & illustration, plays well with Osu!, and just plain gets the job done at a very attractive price. There are always more premium options, but there\'s some really great bang-for-buck in this product and I\'m pleased.', 'Good one please go for it.', 'Nice product in the range works well.', 'Works great']"

Ich kann die Beleuchtung individuell anpassen und sie mit anderen Razer-Produkten synchronisieren, um eine fesselnde Lichtshow zu kreieren.Zusammenfassend kann ich sagen, dass die Razer Viper V2 Pro Gaming-Maus meine Erwartungen übertroffen hat und meine Gaming-Performance deutlich verbessert hat.

Wenn Sie nach einer Gaming-Maus suchen, die sowohl in Esports als auch im Alltag Bestleistungen erbringt, ist die Razer Viper V2 Pro die perfekte Wahl. Sie hat meine Gaming-Erfahrung verbessert und mich mit ihrer schnellen Reaktion und hochwertigen Verarbeitung beeindruckt.', 'Nach einem ausgiebigen Langzeittest kann ich mit großer Begeisterung über die Razer Viper V2 Pro berichten. Diese Gaming-Maus bietet eine außergewöhnliche Präzision, die es mir ermöglicht, meine Bewegungen im Spiel äußerst genau zu steuern. Egal ob bei schnellen Reflexen oder präzisen Zielen, die Maus erfasst jede meiner Bewegungen mit bemerkenswerter Genauigkeit.Ein weiterer Pluspunkt ist das super leichte Gewicht der Viper V2 Pro. Dies ermöglicht mir, die Maus mühelos zu bewegen und blitzschnelle Aktionen auszuführen, ohne dass sich meine Hand dabei ermüdet.

Es gibt keine spürbare Verzögerung oder Input-Lag, was bedeutet, dass die Aktionen direkt und präzise umgesetzt werden. Diese drahtlose Freiheit ist super vor allem für Spieler die mit niedriger DPI/E-DPI spielen.Das einzige kleine Manko ist der Kleber der Grip-Pads, diesen drückt es hin und wieder unter den Pads hervor.Alles in allem hat mich die Razer Viper V2 Pro voll und ganz überzeugt.

So können keine ""doppelten"" Fehlklicks entstehen. Als Lebensdauer werden 90 Millionen (!) Klicks angegeben.Die Viper V2 Pro lässt sich über USB-C laden. Ich habe mir ein magnetisches Kabel bestellt, den Adapter in die Maus gesteckt (+1g Gewicht) und so problemlos bei dem Ladekabel ""andocken"".Über die Software ""Razer Synapse"" kann man individuelle Einstellungen vornehmen wie beispielsweise DPI, Ruhemodus, Polling rate (hz) und verschiedene Profile speichern. (siehe Screenshots)Zusätzlich habe ich mir noch BTL Skates (Glas, 15€) gekauft und mit den originalen Skates getauscht.

Yo compré 40 switches outemu blue y los pude cambiar y va genial, no falla ninguna tecla y no se ha doblado ninguna pata de ningún switch.Se puede sincronizar con 3 dispositivos diferentes por bluetooth que por cierto va genial y no da ni fallos de conexión ni desconexiones, y también si se conecta con cable USB que viene incluido con el interruptor de inalámbrico apagado funciona como cualquier teclado de cable sin usar la batería. Los botones para encender o apagar el modo inalámbrico y para seleccionar los 3 diferentes dispositivos están todos en la parte lateral izquierda, a demás del puerto USB-C para cargarlo o conectarlo por cable, lo que hace que sea muy cómodo.Es teclado de disposición americana, no se fabrica este modelo en disposición española con Ñ, aunque es totalmente funcional porque la Ñ siempre será la tecla que está a la derecha de la L, y en éste caso, la Ç es la tecla que está encima del enter.Para usar las flechas de dirección hay que presionar la tecla FN1 + W A S D, no tiene teclas de flechas específicas.En los primeros modelos venía con las keycaps lisas brillantes por los laterales y solo rugosa por la parte superior, pero ahora vienen todas las teclas con el mismo estilo rugoso, lo que ya no da esa sensación de teclas baratas.Mi opinión es, que si no te importa que sólo sea compatible con switches outemu, te lo recomiendo totalmente, tiene muy buena calidad de materiales y funciona a la perfección tanto en modo bluetooth como por cable usb, a demás de que es un teclado con switches hot-swap y no hay muchos con esta calidad y a este precio tan bueno que sean hot-swap.', ""The feel on this keyboard is excellent, I'm a software developer and I could type quickly and accurately on it. The big downside was that it's only a 60% keyboard and it's just too frustrating to have to type multiple keys to get the key combination that you want. I thought that I would cope but I couldn't in the end. I would definitely recommend the same keyboard but in a larger size."", 'El teclado sinceramente me encanta, pensé que me iba a costar ya que no es español, pero al contrario, es muy fácil de usar y Windows tiene un comando con el que la barra espaciadora + la tecla Windows puedes ponerlo en español o en en EEUU así podrás usar la Ñ cuando te haga falta, no le pongo 5 estrellas porque no me vino el usb que lo hacía bluetooth para mí PC de mesa pero con el cable no molesta por la zona en la que se enchufa, me encanta el hecho de que puedas cambiar los switches, si se te rompe o deja de funcionar una tecla puedes cambiar el switch sin necesidad de gastar más en otro teclado, el RGB y las animaciones son increíbles con muchas opciones de personalización ya sea por comandos de teclas o por el software de Redragon, 100% recomendado.', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0I saved up for this over a few months and waited until it was on sale. As soon as I saw that £41 price tag I bought it straight away with the outemu browns. The next day it arrived quite early on and I must say, I am not disappointed at all. The quality in my video isn’t the most reliable test for sound as it was recorded on my phone, but plenty of other people have tested this keyboards stock sound. I am surprised at how Redragon are slowly going from gaming-centric keyboards to custom-worthy boards. 10/10', 'Vi uma avaliação que dizia não ser a versão Pro, mas recebi a versão correta (a pro).

O adaptador wireless está incluído na parte de baixo do teclado, não tive qualquer problema em termos de ligação com wireless ou bluetooth. Dentro da caixa veio incluido uma outra pequena caixa com 4 switches extras idênticas às que vêm colocadas no teclado (as minhas são as Brown), e dois acessórios para poder tirar as teclas e as switches.

Poupa bastante espaço pois comparado com os teclado usuais, tem um tamanho menor, sendo isto também algo que procurava. Relativamente às teclas originais, estás não fazem muito barulho (algo que receava por ser mecânico) e tem uma sensação bastante boa de escrita. A bateria também se aguenta muito bem, tendo até ao momento apenas o carreguei 2 vezes, aguentando cerca de uma semana, fazendo uso diário dele.

Highly recommend for the price.', 'I bought this keyboard in Jan 2023. Loved it. Past tense. It works great, has just the right amount of clicking and was very responsive. This week, the 2.4g wireless mode no longer works. It works fine as long as it is plugged in. I believe it is fully charged, but cannot be sure as the led\'s aren\'t showing me what the manual says it should. I tried repairing it to the dongle in case something happened with that. No change. I tried reaching out to manufacturer product support (i\'m outside the amazon return window by almost 2 months) from the ""visit manuf website"" link on the amazon page for my order. It took me to Redragonusa.com and a contact us form. I filled that out. I got an email from cs@challengerusa.com stating that they don\'t sell this keyboard. They asked for a screenshot of the order showing the seller - it says Redragon Shop. They said they cannot help and that I should contact the seller. I did some research. Challenger USA actually owns redragonusa. I found it on the redragon website. So I\'m not sure how Challenger can say its not their problem especially when the redragon contact us page sends the email to THEM. I went to the redragon shop website and filled out yet another form. I also contacted Amazon to see what my options are. They gave me a link to contact the seller via Amazon, so i filled out that form too. I will update when/if I hear back. I hope redragon shop isn\'t as sketchy as Challenger seems to be - I dont know if Challenger owns them too or not. If they do, I\'m probably screwed. To be honest, I really would like to keep using this keyboard. I love how it feels and responds...but I really do need the wireless to work.4/19/23 update - So Redragonshop is awesome! They gave me a few things to try - reset keyboard, update firmware for example and I\'m happy to report the keyboard is now working on wireless. They were very responsive to my questions. They did mention that if the things they suggested didn\'t work, they\'d make it right with me. Very impressed with their support and very happy to have my keyboard working correctly! Would definitely buy from Redragonshop again.']"

I didn\'t even take it out of the box for the first 2 months I had it, because my ""fix"" for the old keyboard seemed to be holding up. Finally the broken key got to be too annoying and I started using the replacement keyboard. Today it kept losing its connection, and then I noticed that the Q key has stopped working entirely when I pressed on it, but it will insert a Q every time I type L. If I don\'t immediate type something after L, it will just go on typing Q forever, with nothing touching the keyboard.The battery was also showing to be at 30%, even though the light meter app says that there\'s more than 500lux in my office during working hours and that\'s more than sufficient to keep the battery from dwindling down that low.I called Logitech and first they tried to guilt me and said my earlier replacement was a mistake because I had purchased from a 3rd party Amazon company and therefore wasn\'t entitled to my original replacement.  I called bulls*** on this as it says right on the box, 3 year warranty. I have keyboards at home that are 10 years old that work fine.....two dead keyboards in a year is RIDICULOUS.I also reminded the guy that this was a moot point anyway as now the broken keyboard was not amazon\'s, but the one the one Logitech had sent to me.  He agreed they would do another replacement.  But then he told me the keyboard was totally out of stock, never to return. So I asked if it was out of production, and he told me it was.  So then he told me my only option was to get a credit at the Logitech.com store.  This is a work keyboard, and the only alternate I have is the previous keyboard with the broken backspace key.  (They didn\'t ask me to return the previous keyboard.) The guy told me he\'d only give me the credit once I returned the second keyboard.  So I would have to wait for a UPS shipping label to be mailed to me, ship the replacement keyboard back, and wait for a credit.  What a joke. This is not an acceptable solution.  I need a keyboard now, so I will have to go out and purchase one today, and a credit to the logitech after the fact is useless.  I purchased this using a business account and we have no need of additional logitech products.  He then mentioned a bunch of more expensive keyboards I could use the credit for.I asked if they could expedite shipping, or send me a cheaper, similar model, and I was told no. When it became obvious to the rep that he wasn\'t going to upsell me on a more expensive keyboard, and I mentioned that Logitech.com still has the K750 in the store even though he said it was out of stock and no longer in production, he magically found stock of the K750 to ship me a new one.  RIGHT. But I\'d still have to wait 2 weeks at least to get it, which is not acceptable.  And now why do they want the old keyboard back when they didn\'t before? I get that 2 replacements in a year makes me look a little shady, but it\'s not my fault the Q button doesn\'t work and and the L button now malfunctions.  (The first keyboard was broken by another employee, I know that now, but this one has only been used by me, and has been treated gently. It\'s never been banged/dropped/gotten wet, etc.)Finally, exasperated, I gave up and told the guy just to give me the original credit he promised, since it was obvious I couldn\'t get a replacement expedited in time to be useful.  I figured I could ""buy"" the credit off my employer and put it towards a personal purchase or something.  I don\'t know.  I just know my employer will never use this credit.  But then the guy said because he had magically found stock that didn\'t exist seconds earlier, I was no longer eligible for a credit.  You\'ve got to be kidding me.  Also, at one point, he cut me off and started asking what version ""iPod"" I had.  And I\'m like ""What? This is a keyboard for a computer, not an iPad, and iPods don\'t have keyboards at all"".  So 25 minutes into the call he didn\'t even know what product I had?This is absolutely a ridiculous way to provide customer service.  I was put on hold for the third time and was forced to hang up to receive incoming calls.  I\'m so irritated by this whole experience.  These keyboards seem to have very low production quality and I no longer recommend them and am amending my original 4 star review.  Beware that Logitech will NOT stand by their warranty if the item is purchased from a 3rd party. I\'m not aware of that being disclosed anywhere before you make the purchase.I am now back to using the original keyboard with the broken backspace key.  Ironically, after spending the last two months in a dark drawer, I turned it on and the battery indicator showed a full charge, while the one that\'s been out in bright light is at 30%.__________________________________________________________First off, my experience with the solar function, since everyone is curious about that.  It was the main thing I worried about when I ordered this model.I purchased this keyboard to use at work.  My office has a window that looks out into a vestibule with a bank of windows in front of it.  It does not get a ton of natural light.  I also keep a verilux lamp on my desk and I think that probably keeps the keyboard charged more than the window.  Regardless, I have had zero issues with the solar function of the keyboard. It\'s always at 95% charged or higher.  That part works great, and I love how slim the keyboard is because it doesn\'t need space for AA\'s.  It\'s very thin - along the lines of a mac keyboard, which is what I use at home.My one point of contention though, is that this chiclet style keyboard doesn\'t have the typical hinged keys that pop back in when they fall off, like you\'d see on a mac or a laptop.  I came in to work today and noticed the backspace button was loose and it fell off shortly after. (EDIT: I since discovered the reason it broke is because the part-timer who sits at my desk was bringing in her laptop and putting it on top of the keyboard.....doh!) I\'ve only had the keyboard 4 months, and only work here 3 days a week.  I feel like it\'s kind of ridiculous that a key has already fallen off.  Regardless, I figured no big deal, and tried to snap it back on.  After spending way too much trying to figure out how re-install it, and checking online for documentation or a video, I finally I found a post in the logitech forum from someone else, and Logitech had replied and told them to call customer support.I found this a little silly, to call customer support over a key, but I did and they told me the keys on these keyboards cannot be replaced and that if one falls off, the entire keyboard has to be replaced.  What?  That\'s crazy! While on the phone with support, I continued to fiddle with the key and finally took the whole assembly apart.  After some trial and error, I was able to snap it back in.  It\'s not quite as springy, but it\'s about 90% of what it was like.  I\'m just wondering if it will stay that way or fall out again by the middle of the day.  I think if I had just known the correct way to snap it in from the beginning, it probably would have been fine, but I spent so long messing with it, I probably caused some wear on the plastic parts causing them to not snap together as tightly as they used to.  It\'s so dumb that they don\'t have instructions anywhere on how to fit these keys back together.What worked for me was the following:My key had a little rectangular piece hanging from it, then a larger rectangular ""frame"" was still attached to the keyboard.  I took that piece out at first to see if I could get the pieces to snap back together, but that didn\'t help. So if that larger frame is still attached to the keyboard, leave it. (If not, snap the frame into the two plastic holders at the bottom, there are rods on the frame that fit into place.  The smaller frame (which was still attached to my key) needed to be removed from the key.  Then you need to set it inside the  larger frame.  There are two little nubs at the top of the keyboard, you have to fit the piece *above* those (and inside the larger plastic frame) and then slide it down to lock it into place.  It\'s easy for the larger frame to slide out when you do this, so it took me a couple attempts.  Then, making sure the key itself is orientated properly, push that down firmly until it snaps back into the little frame.Doing this at least got my key functional again, though it\'s not perfect.  I guess it will be ok until the replacement arrives.  Just while typing this, I noticed it\'s pulling up a bit on one side.  But it wouldn\'t even stay anchored to the keyboard earlier. So it\'s an improvement.I asked the customer support guy if this was the only Logitech keyboard that had non-replaceable keys, and he basically hedged the question both times I asked.I really loved this keyboard otherwise, but it\'s ridiculous to put keys in it that can\'t be popped back in securely when they fall out.  If apple and laptop makers can figure this out, why can\'t logitech?  It just seems like they are deliberately trying to make a product that will break and need replacing in a year or less.  My old logitech wireless keyboard lasted 6 years and was still working when I replaced it.  I only replaced it just to get something smaller and thinner with mac style keys.  It annoys me that I can\'t expect as many years out of this keyboard made by the same company.Dealing with customer support was fairly easy.  Waited on hold about 5 minutes, got a human and he quickly authorized a replacement keyboard.  I\'m sure it will probably be a refurb, which isn\'t ideal, but I guess it\'s better than buying a new keyboard after 4 months of use.', 'Let me start by mentioning that I\'ve only been using this keyboard for about 2 days, however I do feel like I can write an informative review based on my experience thus far.First of all, per usual, the Logitech packaging was very nice.  The box contains the keyboard, a soft cloth (for wiping the inevitable fingerprints from the shiny surface of the K750), the USB dongle (""unifying receiver""), and a USB extension stick (to allow easier accessibility to the USB ports on your computer).After plugging the unifying receiver into my desktop computer, I quickly removed the protective film over the front of the keyboard and flipped the power switch to ""on"".  The keyboard began working instantly (what a nice surprise)!  The first thing I did was hop on the internet and point my browser toward the Logitech website to download the Solar App.  Although this app isn\'t a requirement for the keyboard to function fully, it is a nice little added feature.  In place of the Solar App, should you decide not to install it, there is a ""solar"" button which when pushed will light one of two LED\'s, green or red, to indicate whether the solar panels are receiving sufficient light to maintain a charge.  If you do install the Solar App, the ""solar"" button launches the app on your desktop which has a real-time speedometer style display showing the LUX (amount of light) being collected by the solar panels as well as the current charge percentage of the battery.  My office has no windows (*sad face*) and only the fluorescent lighting from above (6 four-foot bulbs total) but the LUX meter is always well into the green.As far as typing on the K750 goes, I\'m pretty happy with the feel so far.  Due to some residual muscle memory from my previous keyboard, and the orientation of the ""insert"", ""delete"", ""home"", ""end"", "" pg up"", & ""pg down"" key group, I find myself hitting the wrong button at times.  I really like the ""chick-let"" style and spacing of the keys however this is something that will also take a bit of getting used to.  I\'ve always liked the way most lap-top keyboards have felt, and this is quite similar to that.Physically, the keyboard seems to be well constructed.  It\'s VERY thin, and has a decent heft for its size. There is a certain satisfaction that I get from handling a product with a relatively high perceived density (if that makes any sense at all), and this keyboard has that.  The flip-down feet are quite thin, but seem to be reasonably well made... just don\'t sit or set a book on your keyboard and they should be fine.  Contrary to another reviewers comments, the keys do not ""click"" when they are PRESSED, however when typing fast or tapping the keys, they do make a bit of a ""click-like"" sound, as do all keyboards that I know of.  The matte textured keys look nice against the gloss black surface of the keyboard, but I haven\'t yet decided how I feel about the white ring around the perimeter of the K750.  It might be nice to be able to customize (or at least choose) the color of the surround.So far, everything has been hunky-dorey, but here is where I tell you why I would like to subtract a half-star if that were possible.  The lack of a Caps-Lock, Num-Lock, & Scroll-Lock indicator lights is quite annoying.  I realize that power consumption is of great concern with this device, but I believe that these indicators are necessary and could have been worked in, even if they were only momentary indicators when the buttons are pressed.  The lack of indicator lights makes it difficult to tell when the caps lock is on (obviously).  Under normal circumstances this isn\'t a HUGE problem, but when you\'re entering a password where the characters are hidden and you can\'t tell whether your caps-lock is on, it becomes an irritation.  While I have not downloaded it, Logitech does offer their Setpoint software that incorporates an on-screen indicator for the caps-, num-, and scroll-lock buttons in Windows.  I did not want to use Logitech\'s Setpoint software (v6.22) because I already have an earlier version of the software installed and highly customized for my mouse and per Logitech\'s installation instructions, all settings from previous versions would have been erased upon installation (why Logitech, why?).  I found and download a little utility called ""Caps Lock"" (search el Goog for ""caps lock indicator"") in place of installing the Setpoint software and this in concert with the ""Toggle Keys"" feature found under Windows Accessibility Options (which makes your computer beep different tones for on / off when any of the ""lock"" buttons are pressed) take care of all the caps-lock indication that I need.Another possible issue is the proximity of the ""PC power off"" function key to the ""volume up"" function key.  The two functions are directly beside each other, and I can see myself, during the course of a work day, accidentally shutting down my PC instead of turning up my music volume after taking a call.  The Setpoint software may allow some customization of the function keys to make this a non-issue, but since I won\'t install the new Setpoint, I do not know for sure if this is the case.Last, and definitely least (it\'s hardly worth mentioning), is that I\'d like to have a second ""FN"" (function) button for my left hand, but that\'s no big deal.All-in-all this keyboard is easy to look at, well-built, comfortable to type on, wireless, and green!  What more could you really ask for? (Oh yea, a caps lock indicator light!)  Anyway, I\'ve always been a big fan of Logitech peripherals, and while they may not have hit a grand slam with this one, I think they at least hit another home run.edit 7/12/17: So after nearly 6 years, my original K750 finally gave up.  One day, it just stopped working completely.  I was devastated.  After messing with the power switch and the unifying receiver, I finallyI removed the ""non-user serviceable"" rechargeable button cell battery and replaced it with another, and everything is working again.  In the meantime, while I was waiting for the rechargeable battery to come in the mail, I bought another K750 to use as it simply wasn\'t an option to go back to a regular keyboard. I still love this keyboard.', 'First of all, after using Amazon for more than five years, I have never written a single review for a product.  It is simply that nothing that I have previously purchased on Amazon was worthy of taking the time that writing a review requires.This particular product of Logitech, however, has made an impression that will last for months to come.The first thing you notice when you receive the item is, well, nothing.  The packaging on the outside of the product is exactly what one would expect from Logitech, nicely printed in both color and quality.  The genius of the packaging design, however, lies within the box.  Logitech has revolutionized how a technological ""green"" product should be packaged.  Where in this case the keyboard is packaged using nearly 100% of cardboard materials.  Furthermore, there is not a single piece of paper within the box, as both instructions and manuals are cleverly integrated onto the reverse side of the outer box and the inner carton.  This clever method by Logitech has not only reduced the amount of environmental impact through unwanted materials, it has also made me feel less guilty from having the ability to throw the entire packaging into the recycle bin.The second thing you notice after taking out the keyboard is how incredibly light and thin it is.  There are several introductory tags on the keyboard itself that shows its features and one of them kept the battery separate from the circuit.  There is also a protective layer on the front side of the keyboard covering the surface, of which I have not yet removed since it does not interrupt the usage of the keyboard itself.After a simple process of pairing it with my Performance MX\'s unifying receiver, the driver was installed within seconds and the K750 was ready to go.  The keyboard itself includes a unifying receiver and a signal booster, I just did not need them.The typing itself is a thrill.  While feeling like a laptop keyboard, the keys generate enough ""bounce"" on your fingers that allows the smoothest of input just like a desktop keyboard.  I own both the Logitech G11 and Logitech DiNovo Edge (Was nearly $250 when it was purchased), and I can easily say that the K750 beats their ""feel"" hands down.I have heard many complaints about Logitech keyboards not being ""game ready"" because it cannot take more than a certain amount of keys at a single time.  Well, in my rudimentary tests it was able to handle up to 6 characters at the same time, where if 8 keys are simultaneously pushed down it will input the first six.  I am not sure what the exact problem with the previous keyboards were, but I hope this will at least answer a few questions.Furthermore, the keyboard prop legs on the N750 is very stable, contrary to that of a previous review.  It was able to stand firm on a surface where my DiNovo Edge likes to slide around.Thin, light, green, great feel, no charging required, numpad and an ingenious Logitech design has combined forces to create arguably the best piece of computer peripheral.Thank you for taking the time to read this review, as it was nothing less than an amazing experience for me to type up with my new K750.--------------------------------------------------UPDATE - 1.5 YEAR MARKAfter almost a year and a half of heavy usage on the K750, I figure it is time to give y\'all a progress update.THE GOOD:The battery holds up against the test of time extremely well, never dipping below 80% charge in a well-lit room.  In darker rooms, all I have to do is stick it near a window every 2 month or so to return it to full charge.  It is no hassle compared to other options out there.The keyboard\'s keys still feels as good as the first day I started using it.Durability of the keyboard is amazing.  It\'s shape had held it\'s ground through many forms of physical torture.THE BAD:The keyboard\'s glossy surface has incurred countless minor scratches during my travels with it.  My recommendation is to not remove the protective film that came with the keyboard, or to transport the keyboard in it\'s original box if you would like to keep it\'s condition pristine.The logo on the receiver rubbed off after staying on my laptop for a 6 months or so, but that is understandable on any product.One of the rubber legs in the bottom left corner fell off after many times of transportation in my backpack.  Actually I am surprised that it had not fell of earlier with the way I handled the keyboard.  Again, I recommend keeping it in the box when moving it around.THE UGLY:Unfortunately the keyboard refused to pair with a receiver at the 1.5 year mark.  It is a strange problem shared by a few buyers, and the solution to the problem varied.  Some say to ""shake"" the keyboard and it will work, some say to remove and reinsert the battery, and etc...  Personally, my diagnostics procedures included:Pairing with another receiverReinstalling softwareDeleting the driver manually (USBDEVIEW)Using another computerPairing other devices using the same receiverReinserting the batteryShaking the device (See Above)Nothing worked.  The computer simply did not want to see the keyboard.Therefore, I contacted Logitech Support and asked for a RMA.  After a relatively painless process of submitting your information, a replacement was on its way to my doorstep.  Strangely, Logitech did not want its broken device back, unlike most other RMAs.And here is where it gets good:The replacement K750 is a BRAND NEW RENDITION of the keyboard.The border of the keyboard as well as the back is no longer white, it is now a metallic black color.The logo between the solar panels is updated to a newer version, and is slightly bigger.The keys are slightly louder and lighter on the press.  It feels ever-so-slightly looser while does not compromise the feel of quality.Instead of yellow functional keys, they are now blue.  Personally I like the yellow better as it stands out more.Overall, the new keyboard is significantly lower profile than the version I had, while retaining the functionality and size of the original.Oh and did I mention it is brand new?  I can say without hesitation that Logtech support is one of top-dogs of the industry, next to the likes of Amazon or Apple.A twist to the story:Apparently during my RMA process, my old K750 has had some time to think things over and decided to revive itself to fight another day.  It is now working perfectly again without any work on my part other than to leave it alone for 2 weeks or so...  If you are looking for answers I have none...  My best guess is that the keyboard reset itself after not being used for so long, who knows?Conclusion:The K750 is still the best typing keyboard I have used to-date.  Even with minor/major hiccups there is nothing for you to worry about when it comes to Logitech\'s world class support.  After the whole ordeal I ended up with my old K750 working again and a brand new one to boot.Thank you Logitech.  And thank you for reading.', ""I'm not sure why it took this long for someone to adapt the solar panel for the keyboard (after all, it is just a larger version of a standard calculator). Both the wireless aspect and the self-charging solar aspect are the two greatest pros to this product. But there's more. Ever since I used the chiclet keyboard style on the MB110LL/A, I realized that I typed much more quickly and more effortlessly. It felt so good! I've actually been meaning to get the MB110LL/A for my PC, but after this Logitech keyboard came out, I decided to give it a try. Wow! It has the feeling of a MB110LL/A with the full compatibility for PC AND wireless. The bounce on the keys is perfect. And believe me, I am very picky about how the keys feel when I type. I own an HP Elite Keyboard wireless and although it is a decent product, it is not chiclet and it has a plastic-y feel to it, which is not optimal. I have never enjoyed typing on a keyboard so much with the convenience of wireless and solar panel technology.In summary, pros:- chiclet keyboard WITH very good bounce on each key- wireless- very good response time on the computer- self-charging WITH downloadable programs from Logitech that can supplement the hardware (e.g., a light-intensity and charge level indicator software; another program for you to customize some of the functions of the keys)- very thin- very light- beautiful reflective surface/comes with free cloth for cleaning- the supersmall USB plug to save space; but also comes with a larger USB adapter for the large PC units I suppose to make it easier to push in the slot and pull out when not needed. (the larger USB adapter itself is not a USB detector, it merely let you put the actual supersmall USB detector on it)- an ON/OFF switch for the keyboard functions (to save energy/charge)- supposedly continues to charge while in the OFF position (I haven't tested this, but this is what other reviewers have told me)- 2 legs in the back you can push out if you want to elevate or tilt the keyboard a bit (goes up maybe a 2 cm or so)- easy installation. plug and play!- very good packaging. sturdy box and internal cardboard support. The surface of the keyboard is presented with a plastic coat that you can pull away if you choose to. If you don't care about the aesthetics of leaving a plastic protective coat on the keyboard (goes in between the keys), you can even leave it on, and it does not attract fingerprints! keys are not covered by this plastic so it's perfectly usable leaving on the packaging plastic coat.cons:- expensive...for an 'old' technology!- the spacebar could have been made with a bit more area because for my hands, the thumb naturally tends to rest at the edge of the keyboard and the plastic platform, so I just make a minor adjustment and scoot my thumb in a little. a minor problem but would have been nice to make the front-to-back width a few mm larger.- VERY PICKY POINT: spacebar on my unit makes a more plastic-y sound than the rest of all the keys on the keyboard. This seems to be an issue with many keyboards, but it'd be nice if they cushioned it or something to make it sound just like the other smaller keys.- as with any reflective surface, no matter how beautiful...it is susceptible to fingerprints. That's never a deal-breaker for me b/c I tend to treat my equipment pretty well and I don't mind having to just take a few seconds to wipe the surface.- no backlighting. (perhaps not too unfeasible to introduce a backlit version...maybe can even self-charge from inside the keyboard, perpetual!)- no indicator for caps lock on the keyboard itself. However, if you install the software, a small translucent overlay will pop up briefly saying that you have caps lock on or off. there is also an indicator for the volume that pops up in a translucent format on the screen.I cannot yet comment on the actual lifetime of the keyboard in the absence of light after being fully charged. But I think that would be a problem only in the most extreme of circumstances, which I will leave up to your imagination.For what it's worth, this is a 5.0/5.0 product. From a more general standpoint, I'd rate it 4.9/5.0 considering the 'cons' (which you can tell is not detracting much at all from my perspective on this keyboard). Logitech has made several pretty unique and practical products in the past 2 years. I had bought their lapdesk, the cooling pad, and the laptop stand, all of which were very neat (though price-y). Logitech is really innovating, and the quality of the products I have from them so far are very professional and very well-made, and that is not the way there can't be potential for improvement.If you don't mind a non-backlit keyboard and want all the other conveniences and comfort of a modern keyboard, and have a few extra bucks to spend, you will not regret getting this keyboard. With the amount of typing we do these days, we deserve a good typing experience. I'm enjoying it like no other. Looks like I'm not switching keyboards anytime soon until they come out with their next innovation!"", 'After reading through the reviews here on Amazon I decided to go ahead and take the plunge on this keyboard, even though it was fairly expensive.  The item arrived in perfect condition; I plugged it in and it immediately started working, and I\'ve been very impressed so far.One thing that surprised me was that there is NO INSTALLATION AT ALL.  Literally, you plug the transceiver into a USB port and turn the keyboard on.  That\'s it.  A few seconds later, my Windows 7 (64-bit) OS detected the keyboard, installed the drivers, and I was up and running.  This is the single most seamless experience I have ever had with a wireless device, and it was impressive.  This is how wireless device setup should be - other manufacturers take note.The solar panels on the keyboard are subtle and I don\'t notice them at all.  The keyboard has a glossy black glass surface that accumulates dust very visibly, but when you keep it clean it looks like a darn cool keyboard. The keyboard comes with a cloth wipe for keeping the solar panels clear of dust.  I use it once every couple days for aesthetics.Like other reviewers, I can also confirm that the battery meter never budges.  I do a lot of computer work - I\'m a professional software engineer whose HOBBY is also software, so it is a rare day when I do not spend at least 4-5 hours (and usually much much more) typing away.  In the two weeks I\'ve had this keyboard so far it has yet to leave the ""100%"" mark, and I leave it on constantly.Speaking of power, I live in the not-so-sunny city of Seattle and usually have the blinds part-way open.  Right now as I type this, the keyboard software reports it is receiving 330 lux, more than enough to charge the battery (if it actually needed charging, which it does not and so far has not with two weeks of constant abuse).  During the evening my lamp gives the keyboard about 50 lux, and for comparison that is a 60-watt bulb sitting about 2 feet from the keyboard behind a lampshade.  On a sunny day, the keyboard receives several thousand lux, which is far beyond the good end of the meter that the keyboard software provides (500 lux).The feature set of the keyboard is decent - there\'s a FN key between CTRL and ALT on the right side of the keyboard that, when held down, allows the function keys to perform various functions: navigate to home, send mail, magnify, launch windows calculator, start Windows Media Player, previous track, pause, next track, mute, lower volume, raise volume, put computer to sleep and bring up the right-click context menu at the cursor location.As also mentioned in other reviews, there is no capslock, scroll-lock or numlock light.  The one feature missing from this keyboard is a graphical indicator in the Windows taskbar for these keyboard states, but there are several free tools out there on the Internet that will provide this functionality if it really bugs you.  I can\'t honestly say I\'ve noticed or cared.The keyboard is as thin as advertised.  It is very sleek, and looks great on a glass desk.  It has feet for standing up, and unlike some other reviews I saw I do not feel that the feet are of inferior quality.  I have been using computer keyboards for 27 years and I think the feet on this are actually way better than the ones on some other keyboards I\'ve had in the past.The keys do have the general feel of a laptop keyboard, but are noticeably sturdier than most.  The keyboard does not flex at all, and I had no problems adjusting to this keyboard style from my ""classic"" PC keyboard.  The keyboard is full sized, unlike most laptop keyboards, so the transition is very easy.  If anything I feel that my hands have less strain typing on this keyboard because it requires less effort to press the keys - but not so little that you\'ll make extra typos because of it (the keys have a satisfying pressure threshold for registering a keystroke).To summarize:* The keyboard is a bit expensive but is clearly of high quality* Most painless install I\'ve ever seen in my life for a wireless device* Battery life is apparently as good as the other exuberant reviewers (and the manufacturer) suggest - even in a dark room for days on end, the keyboard has a full battery.* Looks totally awesome* Feels great to type onI\'d say: spoil yourself just a bit and say goodbye to the keyboard wire forever because you will never want to go back after you experience this keyboard.UPDATE: 23 June 2011 - Keyboard is still working great.  I\'ve gotten the power down as low as 85% through prolonged sunlight starvation; leaving the blinds open for a single afternoon had it back at 100% the next time I turned on the computer, so I\'m happy to report I\'m still very satisfied with the device.  If battery life does become a problem, the on/off switch is right next to the minus key on the numeric keypad, so it\'s simple enough to turn the keyboard off when not using it.', 'Feels like typing on a laptop keyboard', 'I have to hand it to Logitech for finally figuring out a way to get enough power to manage a wireless signal with nothing more than the power from a tiny little battery, charged from ambient light. Once you think about it, the technology itself isn\'t all that impressive - my Casio calculator from 1990 is still running strong using the same technological basis (similar to this one:\xa0\nCasio - FX-260 Solar Scientific Calculator\n). Not that I know for sure, but I would imagine the power necessary to transmit a wireless signal to a PC had a higher requirement than was needed - so Logitech did get over that hurdle (if in fact one exists). In my opinion, the grace in design is the fact that someone in R&D actually not only had the idea to apply that technology to a wireless keyboard, but also got it approved (we all know management can sometimes be difficult to deal with).On to the keyboard itself. As others have mentioned, the box does not contain a paper instruction booklet - everything you need is printed on the surface of the inside of the packaging; recyclable cardboard. The exterior box is still using a shiny coated cardboard for marketing, but I\'d imagine many recycling centers could still recycle that. The design of the keyboard itself is very sleek, and it\'s heavier than I expected considering its size and plastic appearance; but in my opinion that was a good thing - it helps to prevent the keyboard from slipping by giving the rubber cushions on the bottom of the keyboard more support to prevent slippage on the desk\'s surface.I am using the feet to raise the top portion of the keyboard. I am a little hesitant on their strength as they are just very tiny pieces of plastic for legs, hinged on an even smaller piece of plastic. Concerns aside, it\'s worked just fine and hasn\'t shown any issues from a regular weight of typing. Do beware though that leaning on this keyboard with any heft may cause the feet to either break or snap off. This might not be the best keyboard for very heavy typers or older users that might rest their hands near the top of the keyboard for whatever reason; though perhaps other reviewers can comment on that.My biggest complaint about this keyboard, and concern for any gamers that are interested in this keyboard as a replacement for their wireless keyboard... I tested this keyboard using an executable tool called ""keyscan09"" (Microsoft has a web-based version tool for this as well) which allows me to test multiple, simultaneous keypresses to ascertain if there are any issues with key combinations that just won\'t work. I discovered that this keyboard\'s maximum key memory is 6 keys depressed at the same time. That\'s not bad at all; unfortunately though I also discovered that LEFT ARROW, UP ARROW, and then trying to depress the ""A"" key will not work. The keyboard\'s capable mapping functions are unable to handle this key combination. It also, oddly enough, was unable to handle 1, 2, and 3 all at the same time. 1, 2, and 4 worked just fine though. I don\'t think that would be much of an issue for anyone, but this is a concern for nearly all keyboards and is only really solved by some gaming-specific keyboards.I\'m giving this keyboard a 4-star rating for two reasons:1. It may simply take some getting used to, but my typing speed is much slower on this keyboard than on either my personal laptop (Dell E1705) and my previous Logitech keyboard that had standard sized keys.2. I was thinking of replacing my home computer\'s keyboard with another one of these until I tested and noticed the simultaneous keypress issue discussed above. I\'m kind of disappointed considering the current price tag ($70\'ish), but that just means Logitech won\'t get a double purchase from a single customer. All in all, I am quite happy with this keyboard (especially the fact that I won\'t have to worry about replacing batteries ALL. THE. TIME.!!!) and continue showing it off to everyone that comes in to my office at work. I even still have the box standing upright so people can see Logitech\'s marketing material right when they walk in the door.""No wires. No changing batteries. No hassles."" ""Powered by light- even indoors""Thank you again for yet another great product, Logitech. My G500 mouse loves its new neighbor.', 'Finding the words to review the K750 is harder than I expected before sitting down to do it. I want to stress that the K750 itself is a great keyboard but the battery and battery replacement design make it a frustration at times. I\'ll start with the positive, the K750 has a clean sleek design that is similar to many of our modern phones. It is slim as it can be, keys that are not highly necessary have been removed, the height of the keys have been reduced to those of a laptop, and the whole surface is a reflective piano black with a somewhat of a matte white back. This thing is something that you can carry exposed between offices, dorms, and get inquires about as you do, since it has such an attractive design.  As for functionality, the important part, the K750 delivers in most aspects. In the sound department, the K750 is as quiet as most keyboards can get. It\'s extremely responsive to the lightest touch and with the laptop style of the keys, you won\'t be bothering someone when working on business or personal projects during the night. The keys are also well spaced to help avoid hitting double keys, which we fast typers can do on occasion when we get in the ""zone"". The receiver that comes with the K750 is low profile and can be paired with other compatible wireless Logitech products. So you won\'t have to worry about a unsightly USB receiver sticking out of your computer. In functionality, the K750 really only lacks in a small area which would be that number lock and caps lock key light-up status display has been removed and replaced with a small power tab and battery status indicator for the keyboard. So that can be a deal breaker for some if they want readily visual confirmation as to which locks are on.  For games, the K750 does the job great. If you\'re into fast reaction FPS, you might need a different keyboard but I\'ve played numerous high paced games on this and have yet to find a problem with its responsiveness and comfort when hitting multiple keys at a fast pace. The K750 also comes with software that allows the user some customization, as well provide a detail battery status widget for your computer home screen. It\'s something nice to have but for users like myself, that dislike installing unnecessary software, you won\'t be missing much.  Now for the bad, the battery changing process of the K750. The K750 is billed as a hassle free solar powered keyboard but this isn\'t entirely true. It\'s really a keyboard using a ML2032 battery that is continually charged via the solar panels and therefore, the battery will need to be changed at some point since it will fail. In my two year ownership, I\'ve had to call Logitech customer service twice for a battery replacement under warranty as the battery beings to die after 6 to 8 months use. Around this time frame the battery begins to hover around 60% charged and steadily declines from there as more time passes by until it can no longer hold a charge. Dealing with Logitech customer service is not a hassle as they are friendly and quickly address the issue but it\'s the short life of the battery and the changing process that really gets me. As something that is being billed as a solar powered keyboard, the battery in the ML2032 should not fail so frequently when a good source of light is available to it at all times, and worse, the battery changing process shouldn\'t feel like a painful chore. But it seems the designers got intoxicated with their own hype of a ""battery free"" keyboard and made the battery changing process of the keyboard a huge frustration. The ML2032 is located in a tab in the back of the keyboard that must be removed with force and it\'s held in by pressure tabs. Instead of having a simple slide in and out tab, the designers decided to make it as difficult as possible to remove the tab by making it so you have to forcibly pull the tab, then while still pulling you have to try and reach the small pressure points under the tab to squeeze, both which are still mostly out of reach at this point because most of their body still rests inside the keyboard. Then while you somehow managed to do all the mentioned simultaneously, you have to give one final pull to remove the tab. You\'re going to need some sort of tool for this, or a third hand, and be prepared to have to damage the tab in the process as it\'s made of weak plastic. I can\'t comprehend why the battery changing process on this keyboard was made so difficult. Even if you wanted to give the illusion that a battery did not have to be changed, why frustrate the owner even more by making the process so difficult once they actually had to do it?  This poor design is why I had to rate the K750 at three stars. They keyboard is beautiful and well designed for functionality but a ""solar powered"" keyboard should not have such a short battery life as it just makes it a fancy regular wireless keyboard that has an extremely painful battery changing process. So the best way I can sum it up is that most users will love the K750 when the battery is holding a charge. Once you need to change the battery, you\'ll hate it for a while then grow to love it again, and this process will repeat each time the battery needs replacing. We\'ll I hope you found my review insightful as I wanted to give the best view of the K750 as I could.', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\nFour year update:I bought another of these keyboards about a year after posting this review. 2 years and 9 months into its 3-year warranty period, one of the two ""Shift"" key caps came loose from the base, and would not re-seat. One phone call to Logitech customer service followed by an email with a picture of the faulty key resulted in shipment of replacement keyboard --with an additional year of warranty-- at no cost.Awesome customer service!This remains my favorite keyboard ever.Original review follows:-------------------------I\'ve been using Logitech wireless keyboards and mice for over 10 years, and have enjoyed a good user experience with them. Because of that history I began using the K750 solar/wireless keyboard with high expectations. The K750 surpassed them from the minute I plugged in its ""unifying"" transceiver.Users of recent models of wireless keyboards already enjoyed generous battery life. Even with heavy use, I changed the batteries in the keyboard this one replaced only once or twice a year..hardly an onerous task. But why do that when you can use technology that requires no batteries at all?? Score one for solar!The transceiver unit (Logitech calls it a ""unifying receiver"") of the K750 is astonishingly small: about the half the size of a USB connector. It plugs directly into a USB port unobtrusively, or you can use the included extender to add about 1.5 inches of length for easier access at the rear of a desktop I/O USB port cluster.In addition to operating the keyboard, the unifying receiver will also control ""unifying"" compatible Logitech mice and number pads. I use mine with a\xa0\nLogitech Wireless Marathon Mouse M705\n. Having the mouse and keyboard connected via a single USB port freed one up for other use. Score two for opening up a USB port and a transceiver whose footprint ends at the motherboard I/O shield (see customer image showing the footprint of my last wireless transceiver; the reduction in volume is astounding).The K705 includes a ""Solar"" awareness application that shows the current charge and light levels in the room. My unit arrived in a 100% charge condition (after at least six days in shipping). Ambient indoor lighting was sufficient to keep the solar cells charging (see screenshots in customer images). Here\'s the deal with this application: you\'ll check your charge rate often in the first week or so of use. After that, you\'ll tire of seeing ""100%"" indicated, and check it only when your showing off the keyboard to the other geeks in your life. The solar charging technology in this keyboard just works, and it\'s rock solid.In addition to standard Function keys, the ""F"" keys on the K750 have a second ""FN"" function integrated. These includes launching your browser, launching your email client, zooming on a window, launching the calculator, controlling your media player and speaker volume, and a PC shutdown key. All mapped correctly to the default application for each. Score one for good integration with the operating system.The keys are quiet and responsive, and there is no lag of any kind in responsiveness. The profile is thin and sleek, but the keyboard is full-sized.There are wireless keyboards...and there are battery-free wireless keyboards with no consumables and no clutter behind your \'puter.Simply awesome.Two small issues which DO NOT detract from the overall excellence of this keyboard:(1) The default driver doesn\'t indicate caps lock/numbers lock under Windows 7, and there are no LEDs to indicate this either.  After downloading and installing Logitech\'s ""Setpoint"" extended utilities set, a rather large on-screen display (and optionally selectable sound) remedies this. The on-screen display could be smaller ---much smaller-- and still be effective.(2) This keyboard will not work natively with older motherboards that have PS/2 mouse/keyboard connections (even if USB ports are also present). After installing the ""Setpoint"" utilities, an option to install the PS/2 drivers becomes available.', ""I love it so much, as I write this review. THe best keyboard I've ever touched! It has features that are useful such as follows:- home button (Fcn key + home icon on F1 button); if you click this when you are on internet browser, it goes to your home page. It goes to itunes home when clicked in itunes.- calculator button (F4 + Fcn): you don't need to go through START button, and try to find calculator when it's not that straight-forward, or it takes a bit of annoying time to get to it.- iTunes button (F5 + Fcn key): very impressive, useful button. It opens up iTunes when it's not open. If iTunes is already open, then you can switch quickly over to your iTunes screen from whatever you've been doing (like internet browing, etc.)- F6 + Fcn key = previous button (meaning 'skip to previous' sort of button; you can skip to a previous song in iTunes.- F7 = play/pause button- F8 = next button (fast-forward shaped icon); self-explanatory- F9 = mute-F10 = volume decrease-F11 = volume increaseAnd wow, I just figured out what F12 (+ Fcn key) does and it's amazing for my purpose and opinion!It's a sleep button for the computer. So when you click this, the computer (mine is laptop) goes to sleep, which is what I wanted exactly, but did not know while I was researching about this keyboard.The comfort is alright. It feels sturdy, and not some cheap stuff, making its price worth paying for. And I can't continue to be amazed by this keyboard because of its usefulness and design/somewhat ergo. This keyboard will cure my shoulder stiffness, because I had to type in my laptop, and I just couldn't deal with that kind of neck-shoulder pain anymore while crouching on the table.Now, as for the solar feature, this keyboard is probably the best one out there, and the legit one (that is, with the least bad reviews)! I mean there's no cable, and there's no replacing batteries! It's all solar power. But you don't even have to go over to your window and let it sit there for hours and hours. This works just next to a light-stand. So this keyboard is just amazing for this greenness. Considering wirelessness as a plus and no batteries to be bought, buying this keyboard will actually make you save money eventually.In terms of gaming, this keyboard may not be very suitable. I bought this for just standard purpose. Type things without the keyboard on the laptop, and type things at a distance whenever I want to (for example, on the bed). I think this will work for someone who is tired of all the extra stuff and cable-ness, and wants some fresh technology like solar power to go green.In terms of durability, I think this will last long. I think if this gets dropped on a hard surface, maybe it will have some negative impact, but I haven't dropped it yet and wish it doesn't drop on any hard surface. But the material is definitely not cheap though. It's extremely thin, so if you have an angry buffy guy, he might be able to bend your keyboard if he's mad at you. But it's all in my imagination and only based on my textual sense.This keyboard is not heavy but it has a slightly heavy feeling to it than a regular keyboard with buttons of higher height. But this flatness feature of this keyboard makes it easy to carry it around in a bag.So far I like this keyboard, and I'm using Arc Touch mouse with this one now. They look sexy and slim. They're good combination as wireless tech gadgets.My only one gripe is that the angle-adjusting clip-stands on the bottom may get damaged because it's quite thin and not spherical or circular so as to not be broken or chopped off if a keyboard happens to be thrown or smashed by something. It would be nicer if they could make the clip-stand legs more globular or spherical if you know what I mean.""]"

It is a great purchase.  The customization for this thing is something I never would have thought I would see in a mouse.  You can put macros on your buttons, you can change the lighting to any possibility available, you can change what the mouse buttons actually do, and you can add or remove weights to this mouse to get yourself a better and more personal feel.  I really do love this thing.My rating is 4/5 instead of 5/5 because the right click is already failing me.  I have not had this thing a whole year yet but the right click is to the point to where I either have to tap it several times in advance to make sure it is ready to use or I have to contort my fingers to reach the further back on the mouse so that it activates.  I know this is not correct and not due to usage because the left click has seen way more usage and still works perfectly.  This thing has damn near 20 different buttons and they all function properly except the right click!  It is like there is something stuck in it that has to be pushed out the way.  I cleaned the mouse, sprayed it out with compressed air, opened and inspected it, and I connect find a reason why it is this way.  I have other RedDragon mice and they all work perfectly.  This one started to act crazy after about 3 months.  I contacted RedDragon and am going to see how their warranty works out.  If I can get it repaired or replaced, I'll update this review with the results.Right click aside, this is still a terrific mouse.  Even if I knew I'd get this right click problem I'd still buy it just for the usefulness and customization this mouse offers.  A great product, great idea, and great execution.------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATEAfter submitting a request to Redragon and talking to support, I was able to get the problem fixed.  It was just a small piece under the right click that had slipped out of place.  Once I took it off and placed it back on, it worked just like new!  I am not even sure how I missed that but I am super glad I don't have to send my mouse off or order a new one.  A+ customer service and product.  Just ordered a mechanical keyboard from them and I think I'm a fanboy now."", 'I been wanting to buy a ""gaming"" mouse for ages but always thought it was ridiculous. But... every now and then I\'d play a game that I just really needed some sorta hotkey or macro thing but it was too annoying to have to bind and rebind the mouse buttons or rebind all my keys just to have to rebind them again after reinstalling or I couldn\'t hecking remember what I even mapped everything to the very next day.I was a fool. I\'m never getting a normal mouse ever again.Pros- I\'m a big boy so the total 0.04lbs(19.5g) the weights add don\'t really help all that much but it has given me an idea to jerryrig it with some heavier metals. Very good idea overall. Makes you shooty real good.- I love multiple dpi levels so having FIVE different ones is amazing. Sometimes a game thinks 800 DPI means you should whip across the screen just by breathing but with this instead of fumbling in the settings for twenty minutes I can just lower my DPI.- As edgy and somewhat confusing as the program is for this mouse, it\'s very very helpful and can even bind macros and use the F13-F24 keys.- The gratuitous amount of buttons are wonderful, if there\'s any extra amount of nonsense an MMO tries demanding I press, I just bind those to the side of the mouse. I missed my back and forward buttons but I just bound those to 1 and 4 and problem solved.- There are multiple profiles that you can even swap to with one of the macros for those of course that play many many games and wish to have a profile for each game or each class yadda yadda.- It is 100% fully customizable, even the mouse buttons can be changed. You can rebind left click, you can rebind right click, middle click, scroll wheel, and if you don\'t swap between DPI at all you can even rebind the dpi buttons to do something else.- It\'s got gamer stickers for your PC tower or whatever if you\'re a weirdo who needs those.- This thing comes in an adorable little carepackage case lookin\' thing. Even the weights have a tiny case.- RGB go brr. (Very customizable for any setup.)Cons- Nothing tells you where to download the fricken fracken software. I just googled red dragon software (which is not what this is) then proceeded to google ""redragon"" software and found it that way.- The program for this mouse as mentioned before is somewhat confusing.- This could entirely be because I am stupid but I thought auto-fire meant rapid fire. At first it didn\'t seem to fire or automatically do so either. Upon further testing it does more of a burst fire sorta thing. I thought I was supposed to just hold it down and it\'d rapid fire but I guess not. This can be adjusted to fire more than a few times and adjust the ""delay"" but setting the delay to 0 doesn\'t do squat.- Maybe my hands are just a bit big but this ergonomic mouse doesn\'t feel very ergonomic. I\'ve since just put my hand on it at an angle and it feels better but I can tell that\'s not the way it was designed.', ""I had a Logitech G604 for a few years before switching over to this mouse due to Logitech double-click issues.  I use the mouse for gaming/office, but I'm no pro gamer.The sensors feel about equal.  Logitech is supposed to be much better but I don't notice a difference.  Both mice have an easy to use dpi switch.  Redragon is slightly shorter in length which I prefer, otherwise similar size.  Button click quality is similar.  Logitech has the better body material, but it gets dirty so quick that I actual prefer the more plastic look of Redragon.  Redragon has LED.  Button layout is different but both are easy to get used to.  Logitech with the battery is heavier than the Redragon with all the weights, but it's a similar feeling on the desk.Switched from Logitech G604 (3 years) to Redragon M908 (2 months)DIFFERENCESRedragon is wired.  Changing batteries is annoying, but rarely needed.  For me the wire is fine on the desk, but on-the-go users will like the Logitech better.Logitech also has a sensor/bluetooth switch, allowing for use on two different computers.  Redragon is plug-and-play on one computer at a time, but does a better job at on-boarding macros.Logitech has the fly-wheel scrolling.  As nice as it is, it's not really noticable when you don't have the option.  Unless you access a huge table to scroll through...  Logitech also has left/right switches on the wheel, which I found annoying.Logitech has major double click issues.  Tried on two mice and changed the switch, still problems.  Those started about 9-12 months into using the mouse, so too early to compare to Redragon but it turned me off Logitech.SIMILARITIESThe sensors feel about equal.  Logitech is supposed to be much better but I don't notice a difference.  Both mice have an easy to use dpi switch.Redragon is slightly shorter in length which I prefer, otherwise similar size.  Logitech has the better body material, but it gets dirty so quick that I actual prefer the more plastic look of Redragon.  Redragon has LED.  Logitech with the battery is heavier than the Redragon with all the weights, but it's a similar feeling on the desk.Button click quality feels the same.  Button layout is different but both are easy to get used to.CONCLUSIONLogitech's only true strength was the 2-computer wireless feature.  But that alone doesn't justify the very high price compared to the Redragon.  If the Redragon doesn't suffer the same double-click issues after a year, then I'll easily prefer the wired solution than the double-click frustrations.  Time will tell though.  I'll vote 5*, easily will buy Redragon again after this, no more Logitech."", ""Jamais déçu de RedDragon! Au top comme d'hab ... Je recommande ! Allez sur le site pour télécharger le logiciel pour changer les couleurs si vous le souhaitez !"", ""I use this mouse in a professional setting and I have grown to love it. I bought it solely for the sheer amount of buttons this mouse has. I haven't played PC or console games in well over a decade, so I can't speak to how this mouse performs on that front, but for use as a productivity tool, ITS INCREDIBLE.I'll list what I have programmed on this--keep in mind these are all macros that may have an enter key to execute the the command.My AutoCAD profile is:1 Line macro2 Copy macro3 Enter keybind4 Move macro5 Trim macro6 Escape keybind7 Forward keybind8 Rotate macro9  Delete keybind10 Back keybind11 Shift keybind12 Mirror macro13 left click14 right click15 middle click16 Ctrl+click macro (doesn't function well as a combination, works best as macro)For Microstation, I have the shortcuts set to letters and not numbers as well as extremely customized panels1 Q (selection panel)2 E (manipulate panel)3 W (placement)4 Enter5 home tab macro (F2+H)6 Ctrl+click macro7 Forward keybind8 attach tab macro (F2+T)9 Delete keybind10 back keybind11 view tab macro (F2+V)12 Win+Tab keybind16 Ctrl+click macroI keep my DPI settings on 1200,1800,2400,3000,3600.I keep the lights off to increase battery life and at some point I may replace the battery with a larger one to accommodate the length of time I use it.

Muy pocos ratones tienen a este precio las características de este. Ajuste de peso, muchos botones, rueda sólida, ajuste de DPS y botón de doble click. Ajuste para los dedos y soporte para el pulgar. Tiene todo lo que me gusta de un buen ratón a un precio excelente.Como cosa curiosa, es un calco pieza a pieza del GXT 155C de Trust. Lo cual no digo como algo negativo sino como alabanza, es un ratón maravilloso que por desgracia está descatalogado (y costaba el doble en su día). Aunque las comparaciones son odiosas, hay que destacar que aunque es un buen ""heredero"" del modelo, es más ligero, y da más sensación de ""barato"" con materiales más ""de plástico"". El peso también es ligeramente menor si eso te importa, incluso con todos los pesos puestos. También pierde un poco en precisión, aunque gana en tener más botones, que incluso para un manazas como yo son fácil de usar en uso normal o en juego.En resumen: Es de lo mejorcito que hay si buscas un ratón para alguien con manos grandes que sea ergonómico, cómodo y práctico, y sin tener que dejarte un pastón. Por 30€ es una auténtica ganga.La app de configuración es fácil de usar y da muchas opciones tanto de macros y teclas como de luces RGB.', 'El mouse está bastante bien, la sensación en la mano es genial, la puedes apoyar como descansando y aún así tener buen control del mouse y de los botones laterales, al igual puedes sostener el mouse con un poco más de fuerza en los botones y no los vas a presionar tan fácil. Los botones aparte de tener la forma inclinada, el 5 y el 8 tienen una rayita sobresalida que te ayuda a saber dónde tienes el dedo sin voltear a ver el mouse o repasar los botones. No es pesado ni muy ligero, el mouse venía con todas las pesas ya dentro y lo sentí bastante bien, incluso abrí el compartimento solo para comprobar que en verdad venían ahí, para mi gusto, el peso es bastante agradable. El mouse es preciso, no se mueve solo y la configuración es muy sencilla con el software de la marca. No le doy 5 estrellas porque los botones laterales no pueden configurarse con F13 a F24 como otros mouses de otras marcas, no pude hacerlo con softwares externos, un teclado que tengo ya con esos botones configurados y ni siquiera con un script, pero fuera de eso puedes asignarle las teclas que quieras y ponerle macros, lo cuál supongo que estará bien y será más que suficiente para la mayoría de usuarios que adquieran el mouse.', 'util pour les macros comme :page suivantepage précédantecopier/couper/coller ect...', 'With this mouse you can do SO many things without using your keyboard.  You can just eat an apple with your left hand (or anything else you do with your left hand) while you do all sorts of typical crap.  I set the SIXTEEN extra buttons to: close window, cut, copy, paste, show desktop, alt-tab, back, forward, window maximize & minimize, delete, save, ctrl-home, windows-tab, and ctrl-w.  (You can choose your own stuff or key combinations like ctrl+alt+Q) I don\'t mean you must CHOOSE two or three from the above.  You can have the mouse set to ALL of these at the same time, so that you can click ANY of them with just your mouse.Two downsides:1) It takes a bit of FINESSE to learn how to hit all the side buttons exactly, however, they\'re also as ergonomically intuitive as possible, like some are angled a little backwards or forwards, or are dented, so your thumb can get a sense of which button it\'s brushing.  This is NOT for your grandma (who might accidentally delete your C drive if she\'s fumbling with it), nor is it for a clumsy bodybuilder who\'s used to gripping the whole mouse very tightly and can barely hit the left or right buttons.  So consider if anyone like this might use your mouse!2) I find the software a bit picky sometimes.  There IS always a way to do what you want to do, but sometimes you have to like hit ""apply"" before ""ok"" or something dumb like that.  I give it a B- to B+.  But once you get everything down, it\'s great.I\'d guess that my praise probably would go for most of this company\'s other mouse versions, too.  I look at them online and they seem pretty similar, so maybe also consider another model...', 'Pros: - This is the most comfortable mouse I\'ve ever used. - USB-C!  Glad to see this becoming universal! - I don\'t need all the side buttons, but they are kind of nice.Cons: - No Bluetooth?  What year is this, 2012?? - The software to set the buttons kinda sucks.  And it\'s really hard to find on the website.  You have to do Ctrl+F ""M913"" or you\'ll download the wrong one and not know why it\'s not working. - On a mouse of this price range, it would be nice to have a thumb scroll wheel for left-right scrolling. - Battery doesn\'t last very long if you have it on RGB mode.']"

Extremly portable, it folds up narrower and as slim as the average phone which is wonderful2. Battery life is amazing. I have been using it since the begining of July and it still shows almost full battery so ill try and remember to update when it finally dies (more on that below)3. it links up to multiple devices which i love. with a single button press it will go from my Android phone to my Windows tablet and i use it at work on an Ipad that we use for service stuff and its wonderful to just push the button and swap devices, im actually typing this review right now on my android.4. it is actually a good size and i have big hands. i dont find myself hitting random keys very often, the keys themselves despite having a very small travel and it being a membrane keyboard actually have a solid feel when being used.5. it supports even on othe devices the windows or android commands using either the FN keys or the control+whatever combos which is very helpful.The cons1. it is very floppy and does not really sit on a smooth surface eaisly. The plastic and metals that it is made of will not sit well on a smooth table or counter without sliding around durinig use. i often find just droping a dish rag or somethig to keep it from sliding around when use.2. it is not very durable. the first time i charged it, i managed to charge it to full, but when unplugging it, just pulling stright back, a cracking sound was heard inside and it no longer charges. already opend it up and looked inside and i dont see whats broken but its somewere around the USB port. so ill use it till it finally dies and maybe for 20 bucks it will be decent for the battery life3. the phone holder is kinda crap. it is too small to hold any phone that has a case on it in any orientation other than horizontal and even then if you have cases, mods, popsockets, etc it just will not sit in the holder.If anything else comes up or happens ill try and remember to update this review with the new information', ""I searched for a portable keyboard that has their key placement really close to that of a full size keyboard and I found it with this keyboard.  I tried two others before getting to this one and I do like this one a lot more and would recommend it to anyone who taps the wrong keys too often on the right hand side.  I have seen other keyboards that scrunch up the left side too, so watch out for those.Pros:- The keys on the right are not exact, however, they are spot on enough for my fingers to not make so many errors while typing.- Long lasting battery.  I charged this keyboard two weeks ago to prep for a long weekend use, used it for 4 days off and on, and it still has full charge as of this review.- The little tray works if you have case that does not interfere with it.  I have one for my iPad mini and it works great.- Has the majority of the functions you would want from your OS.- Compact folding- Keys are quiet and they have a nice tactile feel when pressed.Cons:- The numbers are off point.- Needs rubber feet.  I put my own on and cost next to nothing.  You can do this too if you choose as it helps keep the keyboard from moving around.- It is ideal to press the OS you are using to get full use of the keyboard for your OS.  You can still type and do the majority of your work without doing this, however, you lose ancillary functions, such as volume control, lighting, and all the other functions in blue.  This is not that big of a deal, until I try and use them.  I'm stretching here folks."", ""This review is my first impressions as I just took it out of the box and used it on a few apps.The set-up was very easy.  I have this paired with an Android phone.The keyboard itself feels a little scrunched but I am getting used to it.  The keys have a surprisingly nice feel.  The plastic seems thin so not sure about long-term durability.This keyboard has a stand to hold an ipad (not a giant one) and phone.  My phone is in it as I type this. The fold-out tray accomodates my phone in its case.  I have a thin case, so something like an Otterbox won't fit.While typing on this takes some getting used to, it is infinitely better, and thumb ligament saving, way to go.  The absolute best thing is having cursor control with arrow keys.  No more trying to move the cursor via touch.The keyboard does not lay entirely flat so using the keys near the top corner cause an annoying hollow click as the keyboard flexes and hits my desk.The key markings look to be applied on the key surface so not sure of the long-term durability in terms of them rubbing off.  Time will tell.So far I'm happy with this keyboard.  Only changes I'd make is to use sturdier plastic and make it a little wider."", 'Here’s a real-time review as I’m carefully typing on this little keyboard. In an effort to make the keyboard fold, they made certain keys smaller and not in the same places as expected. “B” which i use left hand to type is on the right side. The backspace is too small, arrows “?” and “~” keys randomly placed. If you’re a touch typist, this keyboard will for sure drive you crazy!Ok I switched back to another keyboard so I can finish the review. With the folding keyboard I had to focus on actually “typing” instead of writing, and it will take you 3X to do so. I won’t want to retrain my typing skills as it will for sure mess up with my normal typing on every other keyboard.My recommendation: just don’t. Any $15 mini keyboard would work better.', ""I use this keyboard with my iPad when I'm traveling, which is every weekend. Once I got used to the smaller size (which I like for traveling) I love it. I've started using more and more even at home when I have access to a full size keyboard."", 'This keyboard saved me over a $1000 dollars from having to buy a laptop. I bought this for an old galaxy smartphone that wasnt in use. Not only did this keyboard allow me to type just like being on a full sized laptop, it also converts a lot of the websites to a more visually pleasing display (versus the mobile version of websites). Im using it right now. Obviously stll have to get used to the typos not fixing themselves like on touchscreen google keyboards. the only negative thing i have to say about this is that the battery life is a little unpredictable and short (seems to last several hours after a 5 min charge and sometimes it wants to be charged after a night of charging).  This was one of my smartest amazon purchases.', ""I love this portable keyboard. I got it on sale on Prime Day. I can keep it on my office desk and easily respond to text.  It also serves as handy phone stand. Now I can take notes at meetings and seminars without lugging my laptop around. I can't wait to travel with it. It works great with my LG G6 phone.  I haven't tested the battery life on it. I love that it turns on automatically when I open it up.I just wish that it was in a shape that would allow me to put it in a pocket, and I wish it would automatically connect with my phone when it turns on instead of manually doing so every time.  To transport it I normally have to carry it in my hand, wear cargo pants, or put it in a pants pocket and keep my hand on it to guard it from falling out when I sit down or from being snatched.Remember to have realistic expectations. It is a compact keyboard and requires the user to hit the fn button for math symbols. You won't be able to type as fast as a full-size keyboard, but compared to typing on a phone, it so much faster.""]"

The control is very fine, you can click and drag to change the TINY volume control that comes up on super loud amazon product videos for example. The scroll is much better than the bigger version, it can be used to fine scroll single lines at a time. I appreciate the gestures built in such as 3 finger swipe up to task view, 3 finger swipe down to show desktop, etc but the 3 finger touch brings up a random start type menu which is not very useful for me and the  4 finger tap shows the calendar, again not useful for me. A software program that allows you to assign a shortcut to these would be much better...say control H for voice or escape for example. Also the cord...well if that's what it takes to make it work (again I must stress that the wireless version SUCKS) I guess ok but at least make it a usb-c so I can use a longer better cable.

In comparison  the G602 lasts for about 60 days appx. with 2 AA batteries, depending on usage.

For the price, it's a nice, compact, solidly-built keyboard that lets me keep my mouse super-close to the rest of the keyboard. I love the function lock option as it makes the keyboard more versatile; if you don’t use the F1-F12 buttons, you can effectively make those buttons multimedia/extra keys. It's made of plastic so it's very light, though it does not move around while I type on it at all. I think the cord that comes with it is 5-6 feet or so, which should be long enough for the needs of most people. I’d consider it a definite candidate to be a travel keyboard it you want a wired one.The scissor switches are very nice to type on. They aren't silent, I'd say the noise they produce is about average for a scissor-switch keyboard, somewhere around the level that my Cherry Stream keyboard does. The noise level is still well within the realm of acceptability if you're using it in an office. These switches are also on the softer side, which I like (I don’t need to use as much force to push them down as I I did on my Cherry Stream). If you’re used to a laptop keyboard, you’ll feel right at home. Scissor switches in general are a HUGE improvement over the rubber dome switches one typically finds in cheaper keyboards providing a much more uniform typing experience with more feedback. If you’ll ever be using this with the backlight off, the keys are incredibly legible with it off. The keys on the keyboard are close in size to what one would find on a normal full-size keyboard, minus the smaller function key row and arrow keys. All keys except for those on the function row and bottom row are nicely contoured to the shape of your fingers and are pleasant to the touch.As for the cons, there are a few, but nothing terrible. The backlight is just OK. It’s still an asset as it does help increase legibility of the keys regardless of lighting conditions, but it doesn’t get terribly bright, particularly with the bottom row. You have the option to cycle through various brightness levels or turn the backlight off as well, but I don’t know why you’d wish to make the keys any dimmer (unless you’re turning the lighting off entirely). I’ve attached a couple of pics to this review showing the lighting on and off, both with lights on in the room and off. Because I’m close to my monitor, the large white key fonts pick up a lot of light even in low-lighting conditions, which is nice. The LEDs that power the backlight may be visible under the keys, depending on the angle you sit at (but because they’re not super-bright, they aren’t blinding). The biggest issue for me and one that really made me question making the purchase is that the tilt on the keyboard is non-adjustable. As somebody who normally uses a keyboard flat, I may end up buying a set of feet or something else to prop up the front end of the keyboard and make it flat or give it a slight negative title. Since the keyboard is so skinny to begin with, I let it slide as I can still usually keep my wrists in an OK posture. If you use a keyboard with a positive tilt anyway, you’ll likely be fine with it.If Perixx is listening, make the following changes and you’ll have created the perfect compact keyboard:1) Make the backlight a bit brighter and angle the LEDs or adjust the keycaps so that they can’t be seen under them.2) Make the tilt optional for people who would like to use their keyboard flat (if you want bonus points, make it so that a negative tilt is possible for even better ergonomics).3) Make the left/right arrow keys full-size (there’s a little wasted space as-is)."", ""I've had the Logitech K280e for years now in my home office but lately I've been getting some shoulder pain. So, I decided to look into compact and ergonomic keyboards. Ended up in a bottomless pit of options, keysizes, et al.The Logitech K380 seems to be the overall best-selling product over the years, but having read and watched a lot of reviews, I was afraid the round keys and the smaller spacing between the keys would become a problem for a fast typer like me.That's when I went into a tunnel from which I could not see the light:* R-Go Compact Ergonomic Keyboard: some complaints as to build quality and lifespan,* HP 350 Compact Keyboard: only Italian version on Amazon,* JLab JBUDS Keyboard (compact or with numpad): mainly sold on Amazon US,* Macally Compact Keyboard: great reviews but also only available on Amazon US,* Microsoft Designer Compact Keyboard: great reviews, some complaints on build quality but overall people say it's a great typing experience. I just couldn't understand why anyone would favor an Emoji key instead of CTRL.As choices were slim, I ended up ordering the Microsoft Designer Compact Keyboard. Delivery time moved from one week or so to 2 weeks, so I ended up back on youtube. Somehow, the youtube algorithm did it's job this time and showed me the Periboard 732. I liked the format, the reviews were great on typing experience and on durability, so I ended up ordering the wired one (332) since it's always going to be plugged in anyways.One thing all of these keyboards have in common is that (except for the HP 350) they all have an ANSI layout; even those that claim to be US International. Only the UK and DE-versions have the normal ISO-layout. Couldn't order the UK-version as it has a different key layout (@-key and some others), and the DE-version is QWERTZ. So, I ended up on the US-version.Overall 4/5 stars since Perixx afaik is a German manufacturer and should offer a regular ISO/EU version with the elongated Enter-key. Also the font could be better and the Windows-key could have been combined with the Command-logo. The latter is a minor issue since I rarely look down on the keyboard whilst typing.After half a day working on this keyboard, I can confirm the typing experience is indeed great. It feels better than my Logitech K280e and I make less mistakes. I just have to get used to the Enter-key and the Backspace-key being wrong."", ""I prefer a laptop keyboard for typing as I don't like clunky boards. This has a lovely sound, is very comfortable to use and the keys are nice and low. Could use a number pad but I knew that going in."", ""So happy I got this. My laptop for work started having issues where some of my most used keys stopped working. I didn't want to have to go into work and wait while they tried to get me another one , I'm a wire coordinator so really can't have down time. Wanted one without number pad and after looking at a bunch decided on this one. It fit perfectly at the bottom of my laptop, keys same size, plug in and go,  and has really lasted and worked great !Waited a few months to see how it worked out before reviewing  I will buy this one again if it ever craps out.  Love it."", 'I absolutely love this keyboard. The numbers and letters on the keys are big! Being a senior, being able to read the keys is a big help. Also I love the back light on this keyboard. I use a monitor so I like a wired keyboard. It also has a long cord. I would highly recommend this product.', ""I use a lapdesk primarily and I have been doing a lot of coding tutorials lately.  In the evening, I can barely see the special keys like {,\\,%, etc. and didn't want to put a bright lamp right over the keyboard.So, I found this keyboard and even without the backlighting the keys are very very easy to see in low light!  They don't glow in the dark (I think, at least) but even with the smallest amount of light they are easy to see.I'm a touch typist (except for the symbol keys, lol) and this keyboard is surprisingly comfortable for being so small.  I'm not cramped or hitting the wrong keys.  The keys are a tad slippery but now I kind of like it.  I wish the indents on the home row (f, and j) were a little more pronounced but maybe I can fix that.I did read that this keyboard has to be kept clean because the way the keys work they are sensitive to dust.  So, I ordered a anti-static brush to keep it clean.The cellphone pic of the keyboard is only illuminated by the light from the computer screen.  Of course, the phone is compensating for the low light condition but you can see how clear the symbols are.It's super small but doesn't feel like it, it's going to be great for trips.Over all, really really happy with this keyboard."", 'Key travel is higher than expected. Not as low as a laptop.Wire is thin. Only an issue if you move the keyboard around a lot.Price could be better for something in this range of keyboard. There are more robust options for less money.', ""I was looking for a keyboard to fit in standing desk slot with not a lot of room. I wanted a wired keyboard because I didn't want to have to deal with the keyboard going to sleep and not having a caps lock indicator, and it is always plugged into a docking station anyway. So far this has been even better than I expected. First, it is exactly the same size as my Surface Book keyboard I am used to typing on, so my fingers are exactly on the right keys without looking.  Also, some of the other mini keyboards I looked at had some weird placements for the delete or other keys, and I didn't want to have to look at the keyboard every time I wanted to use the delete key. Additionally, the right shift key is exactly the same size/place as my Surface Book keyboard, and some of the other small form factor keyboards shrink that key as well which throws my natural hand position off.Other things that I like is that it is not any bigger than it has to be- it is just big enough to hold all of the keys and that is it. Although I wouldn't say it is heavy, it is surprisingly dense. This is great because I have it on a slick desk, and it is heavy enough and has large enough rubber contacts that it doesn't move around at all, which is a problem I had in the past with some other small keyboards. The keys have a clear breaking point which gives you enough typing feel- not very loud, but not silent. Most of the ones I have experienced that are completely silent feel mushier than this.Finally, there are the large letters on the keyboard. I was debating getting a backlit keyboard, but it turns out the letters on this keyboard are so large and high contrast that if there is any light at all in the room there is no problem seeing the keys very clearly. Maybe if you were in a room that was completely dark and had the keyboard stuck under a cabinet there could be a visibility problem, but just the light from your monitor in a completely dark room will give you plenty of light to make out the keys. You can also set a function lock on the top row so it will let you use the keys for brightness, volume, play, etc... without having to use the function key every time which also ends up being convenient.I'm trying to think of anything negative or anything I would change about it, and nothing really comes to mind. Everything seems well thought out, like even the concave vs convex shape of the different keys so you can tell them by touch. I don't see any reviews on this yet, so maybe this is the first. Bottom line, this was perfect for what I was looking for and it is hard for me to see how anyone could go wrong with this keyboard."", ""The big letters make this keyboard so easy to use in less than optimum lighting conditions, and the concave keys have a nice feel. (I have never been able to work out why the letters on most keyboards aren't printed on the whole key and not just the top half!)Although the key travel is small, there's a definite tactile feedback which makes typing on it a pleasure. It's quiet, compact, and well made. Very happy!"", ""Overall, this is a decent compact keyboard. I'm using it with a Chromebook, and the size is perfect. It doesn't have a numeric keypad which keeps the size way down compared with a full size keyboard. I especially like that the FN keys can be locked. Since I don't need the Function keys on a Chromebook, it's nice to be able to control the volume, mute, etc. with a single press rather than have to press the FN key first.The backlighting is not as bright as I would have liked, but it's beneficial nonetheless. My main complaint is the short key travel. It is not nearly as comfortable as a regular keyboard in terms of key press, and I often get duplicate letters when typing.While I would not want to use this to type a report, for the limited typing needed when using a Chromebook it's fine. Five stars for the size and layout; 3 stars for the key feel. Overall rating of 4 stars.""]"

I don't know whether to say that it is cheap looking, but the key action is really positive.  It feels soft down at the bottom, which is what I like because I'm a hard typist.  You'll hear my MacBook Pro keyboard popping like a muzzled machine gun.  I'd swear that the new keyboard is designed like this to reduce the damage to the circuit board underneath AND reduce the noise from a typist like me.  I also like that the scissor mechanism under each key is much taller, which allows for more committed keystrokes.  The numbers lock key doesn't seem to do anything nor activate the middle LED between the function lock light and the caps lock light.  It may be because on a Mac, the arrow keys are provided to the left of the number pad on an extended keyboard.I am enjoying the use of this keyboard.  It's too bad it's for a laptop, as the laptop keyboard is not reliable nor durable, and I would have to deal with its keyboard whenever I go out somewhere with it.

Seriously, I have used a keyboard like this for 2 years before needing to change a battery.Now the downside to this keyboard is that it’s small.  It has all the keys of a full keyboard but in a different position.  Like the arrows and end, home, insert etc. keys are not grouped horizontally but rather vertically.  The 10-key is also different so if you can type normally without looking at the keyboard, you will most likely hit the wrong keys.  It’s super frustrating and I hate it.  I didn’t look closely at the keyboard in the photos prior to purchasing.  My main concern was that it was compatible with an Apple computer and that it wasn’t rechargeable.  I have now added another check for key positioning to my list of keyboard criteria.', ""The keyboard works great, but the mouse is ... let's say, questionable.

Die hier getestete K556 SE von Redragon mag für meine allgemeinen Ansprüche zwar nicht die am besten geeignetste Tastatur sein, dass will ehrlich sagen, aber es ist definitiv die Tastatur, die mich bis dato am meisten geflasht hat! Dazu jetzt mehr…Zunächst mal kommt die Tastatur sehr ordentlich verpackt bei einem zuhause an. Beim Auspacken hat man sofort das Gefühl, dass man es hier mit einem hochwertigen Produkt zu tun hat.Anhand des Lieferumfangs stellt man auch sofort fest, dass hier ganz klar ein Hot Swapping Produkt am Start ist. Es sind 3-polige und 5-polige Ersatzschalter, schön sicher in Schaumstoff verpackt sowie die zum Austausch notwendigen Hilfsmittel enthalten.Sehr schön finde ich auch, dass diese kabelgebundene Tastatur kein festverbautes Kabel integriert hat, sondern das Kabel separat via USB-C auf USB-A Kabel angeschlossen werden kann. Das hier mitgelieferte USB-C auf USB-A Kabel macht ebenfalls einen sehr hochwertigen Eindruck und kommt auch mit einer am Kabel angebrachten Klettverschlussschlaufe daher.Und dann nimmt man die Tastatur in die Hand und ich sag „WOW!“. Das Teil ist zwar schwer, aber es fühlt sich echt super an in der Hand! Genauso, wie man sich eine hochwertige mechanische Tastatur vorstellt. Die Aluminiumplatte hat eine grandiose Haptik und man möchte das Ding gar nicht mehr aus der Hand legen. Und selbst die blaue Farbe, bei welcher ich zuvor noch etwas skeptisch war, gefällt mir inzwischen richtig gut. Die leicht gebogene Form der Tasten, welche durch leicht unterschiedliche Formen der Tasten selbst sowie durch unterschiedliche Höhen der Schalter erzeugt wird, macht echt etwas her und lässt die Tastatur sehr speziell aussehen. Auch die kleinen aber feinen Abstände zwischen den einzelnen Tasten sowie das deren Schalter unterhalb noch sichtbar bleiben, erzeugen dieses unvergleichlich geilen Look, einer mechanischen Tastatur!Also Material- und Verarbeitungsqualität sowie Haptik und Design, sind hier nach meiner Meinung absolute Spitze!Selbst bei den ausklappbaren Füßen an der Unterseite, zum typischen Anschrägen der Tastatur, spiegelt dich die Qualität dieses Produkts wider. Die Füße schnallen geradezu aus und ein und sind super solide!Ich glaube man merkt mir an, ich bin begeistert!Doch kommen wir zum Wesentlichen, nämlich: Wie schlägt sich die Tastatur in der Praxis?Was hier viele immer interessiert, ist zunächst mal das Tippgefühl und die Geräusche.Also meiner Meinung nach ist das sicherlich nicht das beste Tippgefühl, was ich bis dato bei Tastaturen hatte. Da gab es schon Besseres. Aber es ist dennoch unheimlich gut und für eine mechanische Tastatur nahezu perfekt. Das Feedback der Tasten ist sehr angenehm und die Tippgeräusche entsprechen meiner Ansicht nach genau dem, was man bei einer mechanischen Tastatur erwartet. Schon lauter als bei typischen Softkey-Tastaturen, aber absolut im akzeptablen Bereich. Und bei einer Gamingtastatur möchte man ja auch ein klar spür- und hörbares Feedback. Also das ist hier definitiv gegeben!Das gute Stück lässt sich via Plug & Play sofort an jedem gängigen Betriebssystem verwenden. Ich habe sie sowohl an meinem Tower-PC mit Windows Betriebssystem als auch an meinem MacBook mit MacOS problemlos verwenden können. Dass es sich bei der hier getesteten Tastatur um eine QWERTY-Tastatur handelt (also im US-Layout) sollte jedem klar sein. Hierzu ist es natürlich auch notwendig, im Betriebssystem die Tastatur auf US umzustellen. Ich selbst arbeite häufig auch mit QWERTY-Tastaturen, warum mich diese Umstellung auf US nur wenig stört. Man sollte das US-Layout aber in jedem Fall verinnerlicht haben oder dazu bereit sein, es sich anzueignen. Davon diese Tastatur einfach mit deutscher Tastatureinstellung am PC zu verwenden, würde ich ganz klar abraten.Redragon liefert hier natürlich auch noch eine Software, wie es bei Gamingtastaturen üblich ist. Hier können diverse Makros uvm. programmiert werden.Der absolute Oberhammer ist hierbei dann aber auch die Programmierung der RGB-Hintergrundbeleuchtung bzw. die Hintergrundbeleuchtung als solche!Ich gebe zu, ich hatte bis jetzt erst zwei Gamingtastaturen, welche eine farbliche Hintergrundbeleuchtung mit dabei hatten, warum ich vielleicht für einen Vergleich nicht der Geeignetste bin, aber für mich persönlich ist diese Hintergrundbeleuchtung der K556 SE hier, die geilste die ich je gesehen habe!Ich weiß nicht, was genau sie da anders machen, als bei meinen bisherigen Gamingtastaturen, aber es sieht so unheimlich viel smoother und einfach geiler aus, dass ich es kaum beschreiben kann. Der Farbverlauf ist einfach super anzuschauen. Die Farben gehen so schön fließend ineinander über, dass man am Anfang kaum was Anderes macht, also sich ständig die diversen Farbmodi anzuschauen. Besonders gut gefällt mir hierbei, dass sich im Kreis ausbreitende Lichtfeedback, um die Taste, die man gerade gedrückt hat. Die Umsetzung davon ist wirklich grandios und man merkt einfach, dass hier bei der Beleuchtungstechnik einiges investiert wurde. Das ist nicht einfach nur ein bisschen Licht in unterschiedlichen Farben und dann kann man zwischen 3-4 Modi umschalten, dass ist wirklich unheimlich flexibel, vielfältig und individuell einstellbar und sieht einfacher richtig cool aus!Also wer auf der Suche nach einer richtig geilen, mechanischen und besonderen Gamingtastatur ist, der kann hier meiner Meinung nach bedenkenlos zuschlagen! Mit aktuell knapp 80,00€ für die Tastatur im US-Layout (QWERTY-Tastatur), bekommt man hier ein super Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis und eine fantastische Tastatur!Meinerseits gibt es hier rein gar nichts auszusetzen, so dass ich eine klare Kaufempfehlung aussprechen und natürlich auch die vollen 5 Sterne vergeben kann!Ich bedanke mich fürs lesen 😊TK 😊', 'Ich habe vor Kurzem die Redragon K556 SE RGB-hintergrundbeleuchtete mechanische Gaming-Tastatur getestet und möchte meine Erfahrungen gerne teilen. Ich bin sehr zufrieden damit, da sie ein ausgezeichnetes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis bietet und viele tolle Funktionen mitbringt.Die Tastatur verfügt über 104 Tasten und ist mit einem Sockel ausgestattet, der es ermöglicht, die Schalter schnell und einfach auszutauschen. Die Hot-Swap-Funktion ist wirklich praktisch, da man so die Tasten je nach Vorlieben und Bedürfnissen anpassen kann.Die Schalter der Tastatur sind leise rote Schalter, was ein weiterer Pluspunkt ist, da sie beim Tippen kaum Geräusche verursachen. Dies ist besonders angenehm, wenn man in einer Umgebung arbeitet, in der Stille geschätzt wird.Die RGB-hintergrundbeleuchtung der Tastatur ist ein ansprechendes Feature. Die Farbverlaufsoption in mehreren Farben sorgt für eine coole Optik und kann individuell an die eigenen Vorlieben angepasst werden.Das Design der Redragon K556 SE ist modern und ansprechend. Die Marke Redragon ist auch auf dem Gaming-Markt bekannt und geschätzt, was Vertrauen in die Qualität der Tastatur schafft.Insgesamt bin ich sehr zufrieden mit der Redragon K556 SE RGB-hintergrundbeleuchteten mechanischen Gaming-Tastatur. Sie bietet eine ausgezeichnete Leistung zu einem erschwinglichen Preis und verfügt über praktische Funktionen wie die Hot-Swap-Schalter. Das ansprechende Design und die hochwertige Verarbeitung machen sie zu einer empfehlenswerten Option für Gamer und alle, die eine zuverlässige mechanische Tastatur suchen.', ""I am a Senior Software Engineer. My entire career I have always used a major brand ergonomic split keyboard. Non-mechanical of course. I have since turned into a mechanical keyboard junkie. This is my third mechanical keyboard. This Redragon K556 SE is so smooth. I got it with the red linear switches which I am a big fan; not the clickers. But after using this keyboard for a while now, I have come to love how smooth this thing is. Your fingers just glide over this keyboard. Smooth keystrokes with the thump of the key hitting bottom. No click of the switch but the gratifying feel and sound of each key hitting bottom with effortless effort required. This key board is a cruiser.This keyboard has 104 keys. It is nice having the number key pad since I work with typing a lot of numbers. It has the perfect layout for a software engineer. The related buttons are clustered together in the perfect locations on the keyboard. The feel of the keys are gratifying. I like the various back lighting options offered by this keyboard. You can even download and install software from the Redragon site used to further customize the K556 SE.Now the real beauty of this keyboard is the base. Solid aluminum which has been oxidized a beautiful blue. The keyboard literally has some heft. It is a slim keyboard; the keys start right on each edge of the keyboard. This keyboard looks amazing sitting on your desk; it is a piece of art. You can see each of the switches in glorious detail. Beautiful!The backlighting on this keyboard is perfect. I have mine set at a cool frosty blue. Each of the keys are illuminated just right. Lots and lots of color combinations to choose from. As mentioned above, the available software gives you the option to customize even further.So what don't I like about this keyboard? I wish it was wireless. Oh how I wish it was wireless. Being wireless would be absolutely amazing.By the way, I loaned the Redragon K556 SE to my Son to test for gaming. I had to fight to get it back. The little stinker tried to keep it. Enough said...So this is one of the longest review I have ever typed. Hmmm I wonder why. If you want an amazing keyboard who even a Senior Software Engineer can love, get this one. And oh save a chunk of change as well compared to the price of other mechanical keyboards. You will love this thing almost as much as I love it. OK I am taking my fingers off these marvelous mechanical keys now.This is now my favorite keyboard. It's a beauty!"", ""Not my first Redragon keyboard or peripheral.  I have had great success with their other keyboard and mouse in the past, and this was no different. Heavy duty, great feel to the touch, and the switches are as advertised. Precision typing with the right amount of feedback. I swapped to this keyboard because I was looking for a full size, and I was not disappointed. The moment you unbox it and feel it's substantial weight, you know it's probably high quality, and after months of using it, it certainly has proven itself next to higher priced keyboards. The RGB is easy to change within the app, with some very fun settings. Highly recommend trying Redragon products."", 'My Corsair mechanical keyboard just died. Luckily i had this as a backup. Has been working great for the last month. Very responsive and feels great. Comes with several extra base keys as well as a nice key puller for cleaning', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0This keyboard is a full aluminum build on the body and it is very heavy an solid.  I have picked up various versions of Redragon keyboards and this has to be the heaviest one yet.  Definitely not going to slide across the desk, ever.  Redragon has made a bunch of quality mice and keyboards over the years and this one is no exception to that line up and they are usually half the price of any of the major name brand gaming companies but at the same or better quality.This keyboard has unique blue paint scheme with 20+ RGB lighting effects.  And as everyone knows, RGB makes the gaming work better.  The Red Switches are nice with the expected full depression and release mechanical noises.  The keyboard also came with 8 extra Red Switch keys, a cap puller, and switch puller.  The detachable USB C to A cable is also always welcome plus stickers, because why not.Just another excellent product from Redragon.  5 stars.', ""I've been liking the Redragon K556 board. Overall it feels like a worthwhile improvement over more basic, introductory mechanicals. The frame is strong and doesn't sag when the feet are extended. The keys and switches feel good and don't wobble. I'm especially impressed with that, as a lot of the lower-tier boards get lopsided spacebar and shift keys, but these feel solid. I also find it to be very quiet in terms of annoying sounds. It has minimal spring reverb or plastic rattle, only the sound of the switch actuating. Another plus is that it has a replaceable USB cable with a Type-C connector in the middle of the back of the board so you can use a 90-degree cable to easily route it off to the side.""]"

I get Apple keyboards and trackpads for the Macs, and usually Logitech for the PCs. To keep this short, this JOYACCESS set replaced a Logitech set that is only a few months old. The mouse was constantly lagging from about day 2, and to be honest, I am so used to scissor-switch keyboards, I was thinking about getting a replacement. After I left the Logitech mouse at another house, I needed a quick replacement and ordered this JOYACCESS set, not expecting much except for next-day delivery. At a fraction of the cost of an equivalent Logitech set, it turned out to be far superior. The keyboard is perfect, scissor-switch joy, and I really like that the keys are also textured (as opposed to smooth like an Apple keyboard). It is built just like an Apple keyboard, so it earns points for aesthetics, too. I don\'t particularly like the END key to the right of the right arrow, only because I use that arrow often, and end up hitting the END key instead. The compact Apple keyboard does not have an END key (whereas the full-sized Apple and the Logitech do), and I think that it could be safely eliminated (just a suggestion).Finally, the mouse is my absolute favorite, EVER! It hasn\'t lagged, which was my biggest complaint with the Logitech mouse, but beyond stellar connectivity, it is the most responsive mouse I\'ve used, and I do mean ""ever."" The DPI switch/button was new to me, and the only thing I would recommend would be for JOYACCESS to include some information about that feature in the literature included with the set. Being able to adjust the sensitivity was a bonus I had not expected, and finally I have the perfect setup. The monitor and even the computer shown were also purchased on Amazon, but I\'m leaving a review for the lowest cost purchase because this mouse and keyboard are outstanding.

Not that the Cooler Master needs to be replaced (honestly, I have had zero issues with it, and I\'m sure I\'ll have it around for many years), I just wanted a better-looking keyboard.I spent a lot of time researching DIY boards, trying to find something that looked great, had solid construction, and had the potential for customization. I kept coming across this keyboard as a good balance between hobby and consumer. I knew I wanted blue switches again, so the typing experience itself wasn\'t something I was worried about, as I already know I love these switches.What sold me on this keyboard is the aesthetic, construction, and customization. Low-profile, RGB backlight and border, aluminum (I bought the black) case, hot-swappable switches (if I ever decide I\'m being too noisy with the blues), and FULLY programmable via QMK.I\'ve been using this keyboard for less than a full day and it\'s basically the perfect mechanical keyboard (probably way too early to say this, but I can also edit this review later). I flashed my customizations. LED colors, added a few key changes (like swapping esc with fn+esc, for easier access to ` and ~). I really like the textured keycaps, which I\'ve read that some people consider ""cheap feeling"". I disagree.A few more things:Anyone hesitating because of the duplicate keystroke issue should stay away from the cheaper switches. This issue is almost certainly caused by the switches, not the board. I haven\'t read of anyone having this issue with the MX switches. That\'s what I wanted anyway, so, yeah, it hasn\'t been an issue for me. I believe the Halo switches are the ones that this is happening with. If you already own this board and you\'re having this issue, CHANGE YOUR SWITCHES.Anyone worried about any of the scary information online about having to learn to code to use QMK for this board, ignore it. I am a programmer, so I kept seeing those comments in reviews and forums and didn\'t think anything of it, just figuring I\'d have to read some documentation to do what I wanted. Not at all. It\'s very simple. If you can follow about 4 instructions, you\'ll be fine. You use the configurator on Drop\'s website to customize, you download the configuration file, you download the 2 or 3 other files the site tells you to, and then you have to type a command or two in a terminal or CMD, but there is no actual programming required. This might be a small challenge for people that have absolutely NO experience with computers, but I\'m confident that basically anyone capable of reading and copying/pasting can figure it out.That\'s it. If it\'s not the aesthetic, construction, or customization you\'re looking for, you probably don\'t need this keyboard. If you\'re just looking for a decent mechanical keyboard, you can get some great boards under $100 (or a Cooler Master for a little over $100) with the same switches, and some with RGB. For me, this purchase is more than worth it for what it offers.', 'I have owned several mechanical keyboards over the years, and this is by far the best I have ever used.Here\'s why:- EXCELLENT LAYOUT: Most 65% keyboards do not include any separation between the arrow keys and the alt/function keys. THIS IS A BIG DEAL and was one of my main reasons for purchasing the Drop ALT. That little bit of separation makes it so easy to ""feel"" your way over to the arrow keys without having to look at them. I cannot understate how important this is. Also, I prefer NOT having a row of dedicated function keys above the number keys. I have used other ""65%-ish"" keyboards with this layout, but the problem was that the extra row of keys all packed together make it harder to find the key you need.- GREAT LOOKS: To me, this is what a modern mechanical keyboard should look like. The LED strip around the outside is a nice look, but if you don\'t want that, you can turn it off and leave the keys illuminated (or vice versa). I didn\'t know that before purchasing but it was a pleasant surprise.- EASY PROGRAMMING: Drop has a configurator on their website that you can use to reprogram your keys or LED colors. Then you download the file they provide you and follow the instructions to upload the new firmware to the board. It worked great for me and they even support macOS, which I wasn\'t expecting. This is a MUCH better experience than what I\'ve had with other keyboards, which required downloading their janky software onto a Windows PC and then trying to figure out how to work it. Drop\'s site was easy and intuitive. The Drop software also makes it easy to program volume, play/pause, and skip buttons wherever you want them, even on macOS.- FEELS GREAT: I got the ""kaihua box white"" (these are also known as ""kaihl box white"", it\'s the same thing) switches and they are incredible. They make the old Cherry (and Gateron) Brown switches I used previously  feel so dead and mushy, and they are not as loud and ""rickety"" as my older Cherry Blues. I encourage you to research these switches more to see why people like them so much. I feel like a more accurate typist, and I find myself going out of my way to type stuff just to use these switches and this keyboard (like this review).', ""I bought this keyboard due to on-going virtual work. This review is based off a direct comparison to the Apple Magic keyboard, which I love (but driver issues have forced me into using a different keyboard).In terms of style. I love it. It's sleek, sturdy, and well-built. The Drop ALT exudes quality with a premium aluminum chassis and premium-feeling keys. The keyboard itself is not only quite a bit heavier than the Apple Magic keyboard, but the overall thickness of the Drop ALT makes it considerably larger. The chassis itself is thin, but the keys are really big and chunky.I got the keyboard based on numerous reviews online about why we all should be using a mechanical keyboard and I guess I got swayed into buying a premium piece of equipment.I have been using this for the last day or so and I must say that it feels quite different from the Apple keyboard. Maybe I am not used to how much travel the switches are, or the force that needs to be applied but it does take a bit of getting used to. The chuckiness of the keycaps also means that I have to stretch my tiny fingers a bit more than I am used to. If you are coming from the Apple keyboard to this, I think the Kaihua Speed Silver switches may be better for you (I may end up swapping to these). Additionally because of the thickness, I will probably have to buy a palm rest.To be honest, the feel of the Apple keyboard is better (to me). I guess it may be sacrilegious to mechanical keyboard lovers but I ain't going to be swayed.Despite that, I do think it is a quality keyboard with infinite customizability due to being able to configure the LEDs, the hotswappable switches, and keycaps. It adds a bit of fun to my mundane work at an engineering company. I do wonder how reliable these mechanical keyboards are. I have used the Apple keyboard for about 10 years and it hasn't failed me."", ""I’ve been on an endless quest for that perfect keyboard, and I’d been eyeing these for a while, but It’s not everyday you want to spend $200+ on a keyboard. That said, when they popped up on Amazon for quick delivery I really couldn’t resist.First off, I love the way this keyboard looks and feels. It’s a really nice design, super clean, and it feels so well built. On top of that, there is zero visible branding when it’s on your desk -- it’s all on the back. No giant logo, just a clean simple slab of metal. I absolutely love the aesthetic.There are a few little details I appreciate too. The cable can be used on either side of the keyboard, and you can plug other things in the unused port, which is pretty handy and unexpected. The little magnetic feet are kind of clever, you can swap them around to change the angle of the keyboard. I was sort of worried they’d come out or wobble, but they are surprisingly rock solid. You will want a wrist wrest though!All that said, the rim lighting is a bit much for me, especially at the office, but luckily you can easily turn it off and on with a simple fn+z or fn+x press. I tend to leave it just with the key lighting on.As for the switches, I use this exclusively for typing, so I ended up getting the Halo Clears and I have no regrets. I think if I were using this for gaming I’d probably want the MX Browns. The switches feel great, and while I’ve already swapped out some keycaps for a few fun things, I haven’t tried hot swapping switches yet, but I’m glad it's an option in case I ever change my mind in the future.Anyway, this thing definitely feels like a $200 keyboard and I have zero regrets. If you’re like me and want a buy-it-for-life (or at least until I get the itch again) keyboard, this is definitely an easy recommendation.UPDATE: After using this keyboard for about 3 months, there are a few things I feel I should add. First, I noticed I was getting a lot of double characters while typing. Letters would be registered twice, and it was really irritating. I thought this was just me adjusting to the switches, but it turns out it was an actual issue and was luckily mostly resolved by updating the firmware. Second, you can change the brightness of the LEDs by using FN+S and F+W. Turns out this was in the manual, but was really helpful for keeping the lighting on but at a more reasonable level. Over-all, I'm still happy with the keyboard, but if I were to buy now, I'd probably get it direct from drop.""]"

This looks sleek, muted, subtle. Has high durability and perfect 3 device connectivity. Keycaps are cheaper quality (not doubleshot, will attract grime more) but if you’re looking for a low profile, subdued kind of mechanical keyboard that can be trusted, it’s this one. Frankly Logitech is overcharging for the item and they can. Battery life is EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD. If you’re planning to change keycaps note that the space and shift are non-standard sizes.

Overall, I like it very much.', 'I had been using the Logitech K810 and was really disappointed they seemed to have stopped making that.  Up until now, that was the keyboard to beat.  It was nearly perfect so I was on the lookout for something similar.  In fact, the day before this backlit Satechi keyboard was released, I had ordered the new Logitech MX Keys, but did so reluctantly out of semi-desperation as I really didn\'t want a full-sized keyboard.  But before it arrived I learned of this keyboard by Satechi and ordered it immediately.  Though this Satechi is billed as a ""compact keyboard"" it is more like a compact FULL keyboard as it also includes the number pad, but it is compact in that it excludes a separate section between the main QWERTY keyboard and the number pad for arrow keys, etc.  So it isn\'t quite as compact as the Logitech K810, but it was a step in the right direction from the full sized MX Keys I had just ordered.  In the end I didn\'t even open the MX Keys keyboard and will just return it — as a true fill sized keyboard the logitech MX Keys was just too big for my liking as I was really wanting and looking for a more compact keyboard. I do like this more compact ""full"" keyboard by Satechi, but think it would be nice if Satechi also offered a true compact keyboard sans number pad for easier travel, but that being said, I do like having access to the keypad as well and the absence of home/delete arrow section still spares this keyboard a good 3-4 inches of length.The keys of this Satechi keyboard are pleasure to touch and have a very silky smooth texture. This fit, finish, and build quality are all excellent and it seems more solid and refined than theLogitech K810. The 10-stage backlighting gives plenty of brightness options for different ambient light settings.  One thing I did notice is that the brightness keys cycle in a loop so that if you are on brightest setting and hit the key to go brighter still, it cycles to the lowest (off) setting and increments it\'s way to the max setting... Likewise the dimming key will jump from off to the brightest setting. With 10 stages of brightness, I find it is a nice shortcut option to jump between extremes without the need to increment through all ten stages so I view it as a more of a feature than a bug.Setup and pairing was extremely easy. In setting it up, I plugged it in via the provided USB cable, and noticed that when I first connected via the USB cable prior to pairing, it worked immediately, so in that manner can be used as a USB keyboard to connect to computers that might not have bluetooth.The keyboard is pretty quiet, but perhaps ever so slightly louder than the K810.  Key travel could also be slightly less, but it doesn\'t bother me – it\'s about the same as the K810.Some of my initial grumblings were with the lack of Fn + keys that I had enjoyed on the logitech keyboard. For example, on the logitech, these mappings were built in:Fn + Left Arrow = HomeFn + Right Arrow = EndFn + Up Arrow = Page UpFn + Down Arrow = Page DownAdditionally, there is not forward delete functionality.  Macbooks come with a ""delete"" button and typically a [Fn + Delete] key combination will perform the forward delete.  On a regular (non-mac) keyboard you often have two keys for these functions, backspace and delete.I do think these extra Fn+key pairings should be implemented into any compact keyboard as it stretches the immediate usefulness of the compactness without any additional hassle for the end user.One other small short-coming is that the caps lock key doesn\'t have an indicator to show you when it is enabled.  I don\'t use caps lock often, so not a big deal to me, but I\'ve like the indicator on other keyboards and noticed the absence on this one.I\'ve only been using it for a few days now, and am using it to type this review, so I can\'t speak to it\'s longevity, but it feels solid. All-in-all it\'s a real contender to the logitech K810/K811 if you don\'t mind the extra length with the number pad.  It exceeds the Logitech K810 in fit and finish, but misses on a few minor notes. It\'s real close to 5 stars, but I\'m reserving one star because of my few small grumblings mentioned above — the missing Fn+Key combinations and lack of caps lock indicator light.Update:I was able to gain the desired functionality by using an app called karabiner-elements on my mac to make the custom key pairings I had desired ( [option + {direction arrow}] and [shift + delete]).  It doesn\'t appear that the Fn key can be detected alone or with anything but the designated F1-F12 keys as custom mapping using the Fn key wouldn\'t work.  It would be preferred if the keyboard would just come with the Fn key mappings described out of the box, though. (along with any other ones I may have missed), but at least I can get the desired functionality using third-party software.  If it had these Fn+key combinations built-in, I\'d give it 5 stars.  That is the primary issue I have with it.', 'Me a gustado el diseño y los materiales de fabricación la batería dura para el día de trabajo en uso normal la única pega que le veo es que no puedo ajustar la altura del teclado vienen dos tapones que los pegas en la tapa inferior y esa es la única altura', ""La consegna è avvenuta con un giorno di anticipo (anche nel marasma delle consegne Natalizie).

Key feel and travel is pretty good, but here are some cons -1. it is a little too compact, to the extent that i find myself hitting the wrong keys frequently. my previous keyboard was a MS full-size one, and was about 20% wider. The arrow keys in particular are too small and inconvenient. They probably went for an overly compact design to accommodate mobile users using it with an iPad. I am using it in a desk setup with my Mac Mini2.  Key shapes are a bit odd. Most keys are not concave enough (that she provides a good conytact point for fingers) and the bottom row of kets are actually convex.... if other keyboards have this, i have never noticed it.3. I could not get it to switch from a Mac to a Window machine using the BT 1, 2, and 3 switches. It kept losing pairing with the Win 10 laptop4. Took me a while to figure out that the ""clear"" key also works as num lock. Until then, I could not use the numpad at all. They could have just printed the word numlock as well on the key!Now to the pros1. Backlighting is good2. Designed for Mac, and works well with a Mac. All the function keys / shortcuts work fine without issues, but does not control the brightness for an external monitor connected to a Mac Mini, as you\'d expect. Also dies not control monitor volume if i choose to use monitor speakers. It can control the volume if i use the Mac Mini speakers though3. Option to change devices with a single button is good, but did not work with a Windows machine as stated above.I i haven\'t felt the need to try it out with my iPad but i expect it would probably work', 'Having used a wireless Apple keyboard for several years, I have been finding it difficult to use a standard Logitech keyboard. The Apple Keyboard that I have doesn’t have num pad, which is a bit of a nuisance. Also, somehow the lack of a ‘delete’ key is confusing.The Satechi keyboard fixes these problems for me. It is wireless, has a separate num pad and can switch easily between multiple computers, and even an iphone! For example, this review was typed on the Satechi Compact, while I also kept switching easily to my computer.The keys are really quite soft-touch, maybe more so than the Apple keyboard. Or it could just be because this one’s new. The profile of the keyboard is fairly low, so resting your wrists doesn’t seem to as much of a problem as with other keyboards.The keys have backlighting, which can be turned up or down, or even turned off during the day.

Ja ich weiss nicht unbedingt Standard jedoch schon die Maus die Sehnen wer viel Zockt wird merken das es bei normalen Mäusen stark die Sehnen von Mittel und Zeigefinger belastet.

Ich zockenpersönlich gerne mitbTrackball hauptsächlich Shooter wenn man sichbdran gewöhnt hat eine gute Alternative zu normalen Mäusen. Jedoch ist die Software nicht fürs Gaming geeignet.

Er haftet nicht ganz so gut wie sein Bruder der MX Ergo, ist deutlich leichter aufgrund der fehlenden Metalplatte und somit als mobile Version besser geeignet. Das weiße Plastik zeigt nach einem halben Jahr Einsatz noch keine Vergilbungsspuren. Die Bluetoothverbindung steht in keinem Vergleich zur Verbindung mit dem Dongle. Sie sollte nicht verwendet werden weil sie die Batterie viel zu schnell leer zieht und die Genauigkeit des Mauszeigers um etwa 20% geringer ist. Darüberhinaus wir öfter einmal die Verbindung verloren, was beim Dongleeinsatz nur passiert wenn man sich zu weit vom Dongle entfernt (etwa 3m).', 'Nunca había tenido un trackball y me he llevado una enorme sorpresa. Me parece super cómodo e intuitivo, llevo ya un mes con él y creo se me hace mucho mejor que un ratón convencional.

Respecto al periodo de costumbre, yo en media hora ya me empecé a hacer, y un par de días ya ni pensaba que estaba usando un trackball.Vengo de un ratón gaming, que sigo utilizando para cuando juego, y sí que he notado que la precisión es algo peor, pero es normal, puesto que el sensor que utiliza no está pensado para ese fin. No obstante, tiene precisión más que suficiente para tareas de escritorio y ofimáticas. Imagino que para retoque fotográfico o algo así te haga falta algo un poco más preciso pero lo desconozco porque no me dedico a ellos.Por poner un pega, cada X se mete polvo dentro de la sección de la bola, pero es muy fácil quitarla (por detrás tiene un agujerito y puedes usar un palito para sacarla o cualquier cosa) y con un trapo, o incluso con la mano puedes quitar el polvo que se acumula y ya vuelve a ir perfecto. En hacer este proceso lo mismo tardas 20 segundos y quizás tengas que hacerlo 1 vez cada dos semanas si lo utilizas muchísimo, o si hay mucho polvo en tu habitación o espacio de uso.En definitiva, si os estáis pensando en dar el salto animaros.

Il primo risale a più di 10 anni fa, quando era il primo mouse estremamente compatto con funzioni un po’ più avanzate rispetto ad un mouse convenzionale, soprattutto con il suo software a corredo nella programmazione dei tasti, estremamente comodo se si utilizzano software particolari come Autocad.Dopo 10 anni poco cambia, il design è rimasto praticamente immutato essendo davvero perfetto. Comodissimo da impugnare anche per me che ho le mani piuttosto grandi, portabilità a livelli stratosferici, e capacità di funzionare praticamente su qualunque superficie, vetro compreso.Comodissima la capacità di funzionare su 3 dispositivi differenti, se abbiamo pc diversi il mouse può switchare tra uno e l’altro con la pressione del pulsante sottostante, tablet compresi.Oltre ai tasti convenzionali, abbiamo altri 3 tasti programmabili, due azionabili dal pollice laterali ed uno sotto lo scroller. Lo scroller è la vera svolta rispetto alle precedenti versioni: utilizza un sistema presente sul MX Master da parecchi anni, che consente un passaggio dinamico tra lo scroller libero e con frizione. Ovvero non sarà necessario premere un tasto per passare tra una e l’altra modalità di scroll, ma se daremo un colpo secco allo scroll, in automatico passerà alla modalità libera, per poi tornare alla modalità frizione se rallenta. Ho questa funzionalità sul mio MX Master di 6 anni fa, ed è veramente comoda soprattutto durante la navigazione web. Possiamo comunque forzare le due modalità azionandole dal suo software, con lo switch tra una e l’altra modalità con la pressione di un tasto.Rispetto alle vecchie versioni questo MX Anywhere guadagna un pacco batterie integrato con batteria nucleare (lo uso da oltre 1 mese e debbo ancora ricaricarlo), il sistema di scroll avanzato, la capacità di funzionare anche mediante bluetooth (motivo per cui ho cambiato il precedente) e un avanzato software.Ma purtroppo perdiamo anche qualcosa: essendo un mouse portatile, nelle precedenti versioni era sempre presente una comoda cover per riporlo nello zaino, che in questa versione 3 dobbiamo acquistare a parte (ed al prezzo a cui è proposto non lo trovo corretto). Perdiamo anche il controller usb unifying che se necessario dovremo acquistare a parte ed una cosa che trovavo comodissima delle versioni precedenti, ovvero il pulsante di accensione del mouse che andava a coprire il sensore di movimento darkfield, in modo da proteggerlo quando andavamo a spegnere il mouse.In tutto questo un prezzo che è sempre stato aggiornato verso l’alto, andando a posizionarsi ad oltre i 100€ di listino, prezzo a cui acquistai il primo MX Master e che sembrava all’epoca già una follia.Per concludere un mouse davvero ottimo in quasi tutto, cui trovo però un rapporto qualità prezzo troppo basso sul prezzo di listino. Ad ogni modo lo si trova spesso in offerta, io l’ho acquistato al 50% di sconto, a questa cifra vale ogni euro speso.', ""La souris est très agréable à utiliser: c'est comme de passer d'un vieux Nokia à un smartphone récent. La taille me convient parfaitement: elle n'est pas si petite qu'on a l'impression qu'il faut des pincettes pour l'utiliser mais pas non plus si grande qu'il faut un treuille ou deux mains pour la déplacer. Le cliquetis des touches, la molette, tout est bien pensé."", ""Mouse leggero, comodo e sempre reattivo, mai una disconnessione o una latenza di risposta. Batteria infinita, lo uso ogni giorno in ufficio da più di 2 mesi e siamo al 50%. Costa un po' caro ma vale la pena."", 'Lo uso tutti i giorni da 3 anni. Ottimo prodotto, ancora oggi funziona come nuovo.', 'Ottimo prodotto che giustifica il prezzo non certo economico. Leggero, preciso, ergonomico e con un software abbinato molto performante e utile con la funzione ""flow"" a trasferire in tempo reale i contenuti da un dispositivo all\'altro.', 'I wanted a mouse for ease of using cycling route plotting software on my MacBook - very easy for me via a mouse rather than the track pad on the laptop. The MX Anywhere 3 uses Bluetooth and it connected to the MacBook instantly. The device will connect to three computers simultaneously - a button underneath selects each individually for use. This also worked well in my iPad at the same time as the MacBook. My wife likes a Windows laptop and the MX Anywhere 3 also comes with USB-A module for communication - presumably the MacBook would also work this way but mine only has USB-C ports so an adapter would be needed. The Bluetooth was fine on the Mac. The battery life seems fine and a three minute charge gets you up to 70% if you have let it go flat - it charges via a USB-C port on its front edge. You can also program the buttons to work more to your liking for scrolling, etc, etc. I haven’t done this - standard has been fine for me. The mouse is a lovely compact size for me, works very easily and quietly and I am very pleased with it.', 'Dopo tanti mouse discreti, in ufficio mi hanno dato questo ed ho deciso di ricomprarlo.Ottime performance.', ""Sturdy mouse and nice quality materials. The Dongle + extra 2 bluetooh connections makes it usable everywhere.The cable is only for charging, cant use it as a wired device.The dongle actually uses one of the bluetooth channels. (Plz don't unpair it from the Dongle unless you will never use it. Because it requires to install a Logitec Windows software to pair the dongle to the mouse again)."", 'Lo adquirí para acompañar a un Logitech mx keys un poco por estética y porque me gusta trabajar con equipos de unos mínimos de calidad. Tenia mis dudas respecto al tamaño aunque no respecto a las funcionalidades. Las caracteristicas no las voy a enumerar porque solo hay que ir a la web del producto, me limito a mi experiencia:- Tamaño: es un poco más pequeño de lo ""habitual"", pero no esperes un mouse de ""portatil"" minimalista porque no lo es. Es poco más corto que un M560 (mi anterior mouse).  Aún asi y quedándome un poco pequeño en la mano, no me genera tensión y trabajo con el sobre 8-9 horas diariamente muy a gusto. Si tienes manos grandes, quizás tengas problema.- Funcionamiento: espectacular. El seguimiento es fantastico, incluso hice la prueba de usarlo en una ventana y funciona genial. La rueda tiene doble funcionamiento, si la giras despacio se nota el click de desplazamiento, si la giras rápido dejas de notar ese click y gira libremente para acelerar el scroll vertical. Hay un botón especifico para seleccionar el modo de giro, pero si no lo usas, se activa y desactiva de forma automática. Está muy bien conseguido.- Materiales: buenos, la rueda es de aspecto metálico, la goma en los laterales ayudan a sujetarlo bien y  plasticos que no dejan huellas. Buen tacto de los botones.- Aspecto: precioso, aunque es una cuestión de gustos.- Rudio: no es silencioso pero no ruidoso. Para mi es molesto el click de los teclados mecanicos, este click no me parece molesto para nada.Para ponerle alguna pega, si fuera ligeramente más grande tampoco pasaría nada.Espero que os sirva.', ""Works perfectly every time, with all my 3 laptops. Switching between PCs works perfectly. However, I wish that the PC switching could be done using the top button instead of having to turn it upside down every time.

How bad could it be?The mousepad itself is nice. It's large, covers the desk well, and the RBG lighting, while not stellar, is enough to create some ambience. That is, if it would ever turn on.There's a nasty and well-known bug with this mousepad that I uncovered in my search for a solution to a particular problem. Namely, when the computer boots up, the mousepad's lighting doesn't turn on. You have to physically unplug the USB cable and plug it back in to get Windows to recognize it. You'll even see a USB device error in the Device Manager before you unplug and replug. I thought it might have been the cable. Nope. Tried another, and same issue. iCUE won't detect it at all unless you unplug and replug.This is part and parcel of Corsair's attitude towards quality control, whether it's RAM, peripherals, or coolers. In fact, I can't remember the last time I bought a Corsair product that went the distance. It's just not in the cards.

( à voir sur la photo )"", 'Esta opinión está ligada a la alfombrilla MM500 con un tamaño de 3XL.Hace varios años que llevo usando una MM300 de Corsair. La he cambiado simplemente porque buscaba una alfombrilla más grande que me ""abarcará"" gran parte de la mesa para sentir libertad con mi ratón y dejar espacio para otros ratones que uso (gaming, productividad, etc...). Por lo tanto, puedo dejar claro que las alfombrillas de Corsair son de muy alta calidad y duran años y años. Por lo tanto, mi cambio no ha sido debido a un problema de durabilidad con mi alfombrilla MM300 si no a mis necesidades actuales de tener más espacio y confort.Corsair sigue manteniendo un standard de calidad muy alto en los productos. Esta versión 3XL es más suave que mi anterior MM300 y el ratón desliza con una suavidad y facilidad tremenda. Tiene los bordes cosidos y presenta un color negro profundo muy elegante que combina con casi cualquier escritorio que sea claro (por ejemplo, color madera).Es cierto, tal y como dicen otros usuarios, que al abrir el paquete te invade un olor como a ""pescado muerto"". No es un olor precisamente fuerte y se va tras una noche de dejarlo encima del escritorio en una habitación ventilada. Este olor proviene principalmente de la goma de la alfombrilla. Suele ser muy normal y común en muchos productos de este tipo y no deja de ser un ""problema"" puntual que se arregla tras una noche de ventilación.Mi alfombrilla presenta algunas irregularidades (ha cogido alguna forma de estar en la caja), pero tras 24h está comenzando a aplanarse. Intuyo que en unos días se quedará completamente plana. Por tanto, si alguno encuentra que la alfombrilla se le queda ""doblada"", paciencia, en unos días estará perfecta.Los bordes cosidos son una maravilla, y los 3mm de grosor son más que suficientes. No se qué diferencia tendrá frente a otras alfombrillas que son algo más gordas (4mm) pero más allá del marketing veo que casi todas las marcas ofrecen más o menos lo mismo (Glorious gaming, SteelSeries QCK, ......). Yo al menos no lo tendría en cuenta como algo ""diferenciador"". Por el precio que tiene, y sus características. creo que es un producto muy bueno que no tiene nada que envidiar al resto de marcas. Si nos metemos al nivel purista de rapidez o control, creo que esta alfombrilla está más pensada para el control y que al final, la elección de una alfombrilla de una marca u otra será condicionada a las preferencias personales o amor a una marca concreta. Por precio, esta se lleva la palma en componentes, calidades y sobre todo, durabilidad.Por ultimo resaltar algo negativo. Atrae la suciedad con una facilidad tremenda, aunque es cierto que se limpia con la misma facilidad. Lo veo como algo normal teniendo en cuenta que es una alfombrilla negra-negra.', ""Revêtement très doux au touché.Moins large que mon ancien tapis mais assez long pour couvrir une grande partie de mon bureau.Il le protège et je peux mettre ma souris de partout.Très bonne qualité.

Die Verarbeitung ist auf höchstem Niveau, das Material liegt weich und angenehm unter der Hand. Das Mauspad ist groß und bietet ausreichend Platz für meine Maus, Tastatur und andere Geräte. Es deckt meinen gesamten Desktop-Bereich ab und ist die perfekte Basis für Spiele oder die tägliche Arbeit.Die RGB-Beleuchtung des Corsair MM700 ist einfach großartig. Lebendige Farben schaffen eine einladende Atmosphäre. Die Lichteffekte sind vielfältig und können mithilfe der iCUE-Software nach Wünschen angepasst werden. Ich konnte das Licht mit anderen Corsair-Produkten synchronisieren und so eine zusammenhängende und dramatische Lichtshow schaffen. Die Helligkeit der Lichter ist genau richtig und schafft eine angenehme Atmosphäre an meinem Arbeitsplatz ohne Ablenkungen.Ein weiteres großes Plus der Corsair MM700 ist die rutschfeste Unterseite. Egal wie stark meine Mausbewegungen sind, das Pad bleibt an Ort und Stelle. Dies gewährleistet eine reibungslose und präzise Steuerung, egal ob ich ein spannendes Spiel spiele oder kreative Aufgaben am Computer erledige. Das Material des Mauspads ist außerdem leicht zu reinigen und resistent gegen Spritzer und Abrieb. Und wenn es doch irgendwie verschmutzt ist, reicht es, mit einem feuchtem Tuch (nicht zu nass) einfach drüber zu wischen.Auch hat das Pad einen USB-Pass-Through-Anschluss. Dadurch kann man eine Maus oder ein anderes Gerät direkt anschließen und so die Unordnung auf dem Schreibtisch reduzieren. Es ist nicht nur äußerst praktisch, sondern bietet auch eine ordentliche und organisierte Arbeitsfläche.Alles in allem hat das Corsair MM700 RGB Extended meine Erwartungen übertroffen. Es vereint beeindruckenden Stil, Leistung und Funktionalität. Wenn Sie auf der Suche nach einem hochwertigen Mauspad mit toller RGB-Beleuchtung sind, ist das Corsair MM700 definitiv die richtige Wahl.Dies hat mein Setup auf die nächste Stufe gehoben und ich bin sowohl mit meinem Spielerlebnis als auch mit meiner Arbeitsumgebung zufrieden.']"

Seriously - if you use you MacBook outdoor or even inside having hairy pets, dust around, you smoke when you use it, you drink your fav coffee or anything else ;) while working on it (maybe just a mug of water) - this is what you need!!The foil is extremely strong and math perfectly the surface!! I installed it over the regular keyboard cover bought on Amazon and guess what? I didn\'t need that cover anymore, but I kept it anyway to have my keyboard more colorful not just black :) )And.. at first I installed it upside-down (what you can notice on my pics) - it fitted my needs in that way even more, but I couldn\'t use the Touch ID in that way, so I replaced it with no issues and now it\'s working as it should - the hole for the Touch ID is very thin and sensitive enough to make your MacBook read your palm(s). No need to cut the foil at all!! I\'m extremely surprised!!

I was unable to remove it so have type passwords each time the system prompts for authorization and the Touch ID won’t work through the thick silicon failing to register or identifying your finger print.

I had their first gen Artist22 HD tablet and it didn\'t have any express keys or a dial, so I was excited to see XP-Pen create a shortcut remote. The only digitizer company that had one at the time was Wacom, but I\'ve been so over Wacom since 2016, so that made me more excited that another competitor is making a shortcut remote.So in April 2017, I placed an order for it.I got the product, and well, it did not work. I placed the battery required in it, and I installed the drivers for it. The drivers were separate from the main XP-Pen tablet drivers. The input from pressing the keys and rotating the wheel did not register 9 times out of 10, and the 1 time it did, it was a slow response. So the remote barely did what it was made to do. I shortly contacted XP-Pen on here to ask for a replacement and they agreed.I received the replacement version and I was happy to see it work as intended. The dial and the keys functioned and responded quickly. It was easy to set up the keybinds and what the dial would do according to the function(s) you assign the button in the dial\'s middle. It worked well as a remote.However, the dial doesn\'t rotate smoothly. It takes a bit more force than needed to move it, and sometimes I\'d end up moving the remote itself trying to rotate the dial. The grips under the remote don\'t hold it in place, so the remote is prone to slipping. The usb dongle that enables its Bluetooth capability is fragile, as overtime, the small black handle of it started to split apart.Recently, as of 2023, I unearthed the remote and the dongle from the resting place I relegated it (my drawer), and then I started to see where more problems started to arise. This remote is NOT built to last. It would seem quite obvious by the materials it is built with, but c\'mon, I haven\'t used it since 2019-22, and NOW it refuses to function at all?The usb dongle ready to draw its last breath miraculously managed to connect to the Linux XP-Pen drivers (which is convenient, no separate driver needed in this case IF you have an XP-Pen tablet). As for function? Well... the first one barely functioned as mentioned before, but this NO LONGER functioned AT ALL! It just.. did nothing, even after not using it for years.I set up all of the keybinds and the dial functions and took it to Krita and it did nothing.Removed the tortured dongle and removed the battery from the remote, and put those away after trying for some odd reason to use this again for my Artist24 (not Pro version/no expresskeys on either side). I, um, am not satisfied with this. Granted, it\'s $35 compared to Huion\'s recent $50 equivalent, or Wacom\'s or Xencelabs equivalents nearing $100, but I\'m sure that the product should work as advertised and should have some level of longevity (it\'s not like I chucked at a wall for sport lol).________________________________________*IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT DRIVER SOFTWARE*When I got this remote in 2017, the AC19 drivers software was functionally separate from the XP-Pen tablet driver, meaning the drivers made specifically for the remote WEREN\'T tablet drivers, so it wouldn\'t interfere with your tablet capabilities and the drivers it relies on. HOWEVER, that particular software was last updated in 2019, and the newer software for the remote are TABLET drivers. So if you bought this XP-Pen remote but used a tablet from another manufacturer, you are out of luck since the ""updated"" drivers for the remote are tablet drivers for XP-Pen tablets.These drivers can recognize the remote and you can configure the remote settings in the software, but your Huion, Gaomon, Wacom, VEIKK, etc, anything not XP-Pen will cease to function because XP-Pen\'s TABLET drivers (on the AC19\'s driver download page) will stop the drivers for your tablet. If you use an XP-Pen tablet, using the AC19 Remote won\'t be a big deal since it\'s convenient.*END OF IMPORTANT DRIVER INFO*________________________________________I don\'t recommend this product, even at its $35 pricing. It is strange how XP-Pen hasn\'t bothered upgrading the product and fixing the problems coming with it, yet still keeps this product at the SAME $35.99 price it had since 2017! The remote is cheaply built, the grip pads at the bottom don\'t even keep the remote in place (is it even rubber??), the dang usb to plug in is fragile, and overall, the remote succumbed to failure after not using it since 2019-22.I hope XP-Pen really considers making an update to this product, with wired and wireless capabilities. If it will cost more to make a good and functioning product, that would be worth it. But for now, I\'d consider using a keyboard, buying an XP-Pen tablet with expresskeys on its side, or buying an expresskey remote from another brand that hopefully doesn\'t interfere with your tablet drivers. Rare XP-Pen L', '仕事で良く使う2DCADやExcel、AcrobatReaderなどで、いちいちメニューから辿って行ったり、キーコンビネーション使ったりしていたのが面倒だったので、念願の左手デバイスを手に入れてみました。【私の場合の使用例】CADは機能をコマンドで呼び出した方(dimlinear [Enter]とか)が早かったりするので、よく使うコマンドを登録して効率的に作業できるように。Excelはキーにコピペ・Ctrl+Z・印刷プレビュー・F2を登録、ホイールは横スクロール（Alt+Pgup（or Pgdn））が出来るように登録。※ExcelはShift+Ctrl+マウススクロールで横スクロール出来るのですが、そういう操作の登録がホイールには出来ないのが残念。Acrobatはホイール操作がズームとスクロールを切り替えれる、というか左手でズーム右手でスクロールが出来るようになり、見たい部分を素早くズームしたり位置を合わせたりが出来るようになりました。イマドキのスマホより小さいポケットサイズなので、携帯袋を作れば持ち運びするのも楽だと思います。時々自宅PCで撮影した動画の編集（切った貼ったする程度ですが）でDaVinciを使うので、その時だけ持って帰って使うといったことも考えています。値段なりのチープさはありますが、壊れずに長く使えることを願っております。', 'First off, I want to mention I purchased this to use as a compact portable teleprompter controller.  I have not used it for artwork related things but I imagine, based off the programmability, this would be great for that also.  TL;DR at the bottom of this review.I purchased this to use with various teleprompter programs in live TV production.  There are other brands of scroll controllers but I wanted something more like a keyboard with a mouse scroll wheel attached in its format.  I stumbled upon the XP-PEN AC19 during my search and figured I\'d give it a try because it was cheaper than any other option which came close to my goal of compact, enough keys, and had a scroll wheel.After receiving it I downloaded their software and drivers, installed, and set to programming it.  Programming is very straight forward and they thought of almost everything.Almost.The scroll wheel has an option to be set to function as a mouse wheel... but there doesn\'t seem to be a way to change which way it scrolls.  This isn\'t a huge issue, it\'s just a minor adjustment to make on my part but it seems like this would be a simple update of the software to add a check box to swap the scroll direction.  If it had this option then I would say this is 100% perfect as a teleprompter scroll controller.Construction wise, it is lightweight (deceptively so once it\'s out of the box) but it doesn\'t feel cheap.  It has rubber on the bottom to keep it from sliding around, the buttons feel about the same as most laptop keyboards, and the scroll wheel has a quiet but tactile click as you scroll it.The wireless receiver slots into the underside in a pressure fit slot.  Currently, the fit here is super tight making it difficult to remove but very secure when in place.  Over time it may loosen to where the dongle falls out more easily so I would recommend buying a small pouch or some other container to keep this in when not in use (something as simple as even just a glasses bag should work).  Alternately, you can use my solution which is to attach the dongle to a USB extension cable semi permanently (plug it in and put colored electrical tape over it).  This allows me to get the receiver right up next to the controller for a more reliable connection while the tape makes it much harder to misplace or for someone to ""borrow"" my cable when I\'m not looking.Beyond that, the last feature I wish it had is an LED indicator light for when it is on or off.  Since this is a wireless controller, it takes a single AAA battery... it would be nice to have a visual indicator that the unit is on.TL;DR - This is a well constructed and easy to use controller which I am using with a teleprompter.  It is a 4 out of 5 star item due to the inability to adjust the scroll direction when the wheel is set to scrolling in the software and the lack of a power indication LED.  If they add the feature to swap the scroll wheel direction in the software, I would give it 5 stars because I can live without the power LED.  Hopefully they\'ll see this review/feature request and update the software (in which case I\'ll edit this review and give it a full 5 stars).', '用途としては事務作業、前々から左手操作グッズが欲しいと思ていたので購入。使えば使うほど自分の右腕になりそう。もっとよかったのがサポート、ボタンへの登録方法が分からなかったためメールで問い合わせをすると、30分程度で返信あり。お礼メールにも返信ありと最高の対応。これだけで購入する価値がある。', ""My main reason for getting this was to have a controller for Davinci Resolve 16.2 (at the time of writing this).  I see that it's used for drawing tablets but I don't know how to use it with those.  I was a bit skeptical because of the price, but after setting it up,  I really like this thing. If you're not aware of what it does, it's essentially a macro pad with a jog wheel.  You can program the 9 keys and the button in the middle of the wheel as well as the wheel itself.  The directions say otherwise then immediately shows you how to program the wheel.  Set up was easy, go to the site and download the drivers(windows said it didn't need them, but I tried to load them anyway) and download the software.After setting up what I wanted in Davinci, I decided that I wanted to play around with it a little more.  You can use this to execute programs so I have this set to launch Davinci, Chrome, and Firefox.  Here's where the not perfect comes in.  I did have it set to launch OBS, but it just won't do it despite double-checking the path to make sure I wasn't making a mistake.  So some executables won't be able to launch from this device.You can set up key combinations to one key for the most part as long as it doesn't involve the Function key.  I found that they don't have it set up to use that at all, so controlling volume up/down and general media usage might be out the window.  I could see using this with something like Short Keys to get it to do anything you want it to do.The quality of materials is where you're saving your money.  The plastic is cheap, the keys are on rubber domes, and it's set up to be compact so think more of like cheap laptop keys.  They did put a significant amount of rubber on the back to prevent sliding, but just be aware this is very light and pretty flimsy.  They do provide a dongle holder into the casing, so if you have to take it with you it's all in one spot.It takes one AAA battery and I haven't used it long enough to describe the battery life.  It does have a light that flashes every once in while to indicate that it's communicating with the dongle and I don't know how much juice it's using to do that, but I haven't had a delay when striking a key and it reacting to my keypress in any significant way.Overall I'm impressed by this little thing, and that it's affordable is a huge bonus.  If this dies in the next 6 months to a year I'll easily buy another, but I've really enjoyed using it for video editing and lazy program launching. I was, however able to set up hotkeys within OBS once it was open.  I have mine set to transition between scenes much like stream deck just without the fancy backlit customizable icons.  Those of you really into streaming and looking for a cheap solution that doesn't involve your phone might want to look at something like this."", ""Failed at ~4 Month point.  Wheel has gone kaput so remote is longer usable for me.  This remote was ergonomically ideal for my needs which is the entire reason I was using it over other brands I have on hand (eg Wacom, Huion, Pi Engineering)** Build Quality is the main problem with this remote.  Functionally it works well (for a while), but the build quality is super cheap and will ultimately haunt buyer/user.#BeAdvised---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEWI just received this product I purchased to use with a Huion KAMVAS 16 Pro tablet and am quite impressed, particularly at this price-point.**I have read about 'potential conflicts' with drivers and that it 'may be necessary' to uninstall any non-XP-Pen drivers prior to installation/setup.  I changed nothing on my Win7 setup. HUION Driver installed, and the XP-Pen controller driver installed seamlessly allowing the controller to begin working perfectly with tablet in mere minutes.  (Win7)At this price-point, if you need a Bluetooth Controller, I *highly* recommend giving this one a shot.  I'm in my 60s with a smoked lower back so being 'comfortable' is paramount.  Using this remote, I can lean back in a quasi-reclining desk chair, support my tablet with a soft foam 'stand', and hold this remote in my left hand which is also supporting the tablet from behind.  Sounds convoluted but it's an idyllic setup .. for me.  Your mileage may vary.There is a 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐟𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 difference in build quality between the XP-Pen remote (plastic) and the Wacom ExpressKeys (metal housing) which likely accounts for a good portion of the price difference (XP-Pen Remote = ~$35 ... Wacom ExpressKeys = ~$100).  There's nothing 'wrong' with the XP-Pen remote and I honestly prefer it to the Wacom in some areas (eg scroll wheel) ... I prefer a wheel that actually rotates which feels more natural to me than a 'touch wheel' that offers no tactile feedback, particularly when making minor brush size adjustments.  Again, personal preference.#BTW ... The requisite Bluetooth adapter (USB Dongle) is included with this controller.  I mention this only because I didn't notice its inclusion and ordered a separate one ... which is now destined for the spares bin.#Recommended  #GreatValue** Any changes/updates will be added to this initial reaction.*** NOTE: Rcv'd the Wacom ExpressKeys Remote yesterday and getting it setup.  Currently running:- Huion KAMVAS 16 Pro  (current drivers running on Win7)- XP-Pen Remote (w/their current drivers)- Wacom ExpressKeys Remote (w/their current drivers)*** NO CONFLICT noted to date ... all three work seamlessly, and simultaneously, together... will update if changes manifest#Enjoy**EDIT: Wacom ExpressKeys driver had to be uninstalled as system began protesting having Huion, XP-Pen, and Wacom drivers running simultaneously.  It worked very well (ie no conflicts) for weeks prior to the driver conflict mayhem ensuing.I may try again but it won't be too soon as I've got other fish to fry.  Good news is the XP-Pen Remote is working like a champ with the Huion Tablet/Drivers and I'm very much enjoying the experience (Win7)."", ""I have a 22 inch XP pen display that has 16 shortcut keys.  I wanted to add a device with a wheel to rotate and zoom in and out, and to smoothly change the size of my brushes on the fly. I worried that the large number of  keys on the two devices would be a problem, that the drivers would conflict or something. . .. Didn't happen: all of the keys work together smoothly. The drivers updated so that there are now two parts to the user window: one for the display and one for the keyboard. Both devices can be configured separately and the whole thing works. XP did a good job of programming.  It IS plastic and quite light, and I wouldn't want it to hit the floor, but it is relatively inexpensive for its level of functionality.  I would note that I have a pen display made by XP, the same company that makes the keyboard. I can't say how well this would work with another brand of display..  But if you have an XP device, I highly recommend it. I would definitley buy it again.""]"

Unlike the Apple keyboard this one has LEDs for power and for function lock as well.I normally don’t spend this much on a keyboard so I hope it is worth it in the long run.UPDATE:  After ten days of use, here are my observations:- A few times the caps lock light was not turning on.  I had to re-plug the keyboard back into the USB port and that fixed it. It’s a minor annoyance but I wish it didn’t happen for the price I paid.- One minor thing I noticed is that one or two of the keys occasionally have a gritty feeling, as if there is sand caught under the key when I press it.  This is a brand new keyboard so it’s not like it’s already dirty. Not a deal-breaker but I thought I’d bring it up.  It seems to be occurring less and less as the days pass however.- The location of the Function key in the lower left corner really messes me up.  I am used to having the Control key there but instead it is to its right.  I have stopped counting how many times I have tried to press Control and realize it was the wrong button being pressed.UPDATE (March 2021) - I don’t use this with my Mac anymore as I prefer the feeling of my old Apple keyboard.  However, i have been using it with my Windows PC and have had no issues, and no problem with the caps lock light either.  Also, I can confirm this keyboard works with the Raspberry Pi Zero.', 'Atendeu plenamente ao desejado.', ""I bought this keyboard as an alternative to the Logitech MX Keys, another slim chiclet keyboard that I would have chosen if not for the fact that it's exclusively a wireless product.This Satechi keyboard almost looks like the MX Keys, but is also offered in wired format, which I greatly appreciate.It suffers from several shortcomings that could've made it a 5/5 keyboard (in my opinion) :- The left CTRL and left ALT keys have been swapped around with the FN/Cmd keys... So if you plan on playing games with this keyboard, be prepared to re-adjust your finger placement. The left CTRL is not that big of a deal getting used to, but the left ALT button is particularly uncomfortable to reach with your thumb if you regularly use the key that way.- Compared to the Logitech MX Keys and the pictures shown on the store page, the dishes in the keycaps are not deep at all, and they almost don't feel present on this keyboard. I would've personally preferred deeper dishes like those found on the MX Keys, but I guess for people who prefer flat keycaps like those found in laptops, then this should help to accommodate them.- No LED lights for night-time typing.Other than those issues, this keyboard is excellent, is very quiet and feels great to type on with its tactility. The keycaps barely wobble, the aluminium casing gives it a solid feel and it is quite fast and responsive for gaming purposes (if you can overlook the left CTRL/ALT key placement). It also works flawlessly on Linux, so don't worry about the spec requirements.If Satechi ever makes a tenkeyless version of this type of keyboard and tweaked the features enumerated above while retaining a wired option, I don't think I would ever go back to mechanical keyboards again."", ""This is a very nice-looking keyboard, and it's comfortable to type on, but... the caps-lock indicator will randomly stop working. I've found unplugging and replugging in the keyboard (same USB port) fixes it for a while."", 'I had a Moshi Celesta full-sized keyboard for years. When I upgraded my Mac recently I treated myself to a new Satechi keyboard. I have had great results with Satechi products so I was expecting satisfaction in spite of some of the negative reviews of this keyboard.So far it has been absolutely perfect in terms of feel and comfort. I applied the two rubber disc bumper feet to the back corners and it provides just the right angle for the way I address the keys. I worried that I would need time to adjust to a new device but within minutes I was flying along at my usual speed. The keys provide just the right amount of pressure and feedback. The Moshi\'s keys were beveled and the Satechi\'s are more angular and sharp so I wondered if my fingertips would get caught up there, but not the case.The base of the keyboard has a solid amount of heft so that it stays put when I\'m typing (I have a desk mat so that may help provide more friction also). Other reviews mention the placement of the Fn key as a bit odd. I use keyboard commands with modifier keys frequently, but the Fn key placement has not been an issue. The only other key that has tripped me up maybe 2% of the time so far, is the PrintScreen (""prtscn"") which is right above the forward delete key. Muscle memory from my old Moshi causes me to hit the prtscn key instead of delete sometimes but again my awareness is growing and I don\'t see it being a longterm issue.I opted for the corded version although I strongly considered the BT version of this keyboard which lets you switch between different devices. Instead, I use an app on my Mac that lets me connect to devices when needed so I can input text with my keyboard. I find corded keyboards acceptable and I\'ll take solid plug and play reliability over the minor aesthetic benefit of wireless keyboards. Oddly, I wish the cord of this keyboard were a little thicker. It seems a bit thin. I have a Satechi USB hub and card reader on the base of my iMac and it has a much bigger cord for some reason (see photo).Comparing the Satechi to the Apple keyboard that shipped with my new iMac, the Satechi crushes it. I can run my fingers over the Satechi keys and not hear any play. Try that on the Apple and it\'s got a surprisingly cheap, Chiclet sounding effect. Add the fullsized numeric keypad and the Satechi is a clear winner over the Apple BT keyboard.I\'m very happy with this item.', ""Da assiduo habitue della tastiera originale Apple con cavo (oggi non più disponibile) ho fatto molte ricerche per trovare una valida alternativa alla costosissima Magic Keyboard con tastierino numerico. Negli Stati Uniti a quanto pare esistono vari brand di terze parti che copiano o si ispirano (come nel caso della SATECHI) alla comoda Apple Keyboard. Date le molte recensioni positive su Amazon.com ho acquistato questa SATECHI con la speranza che potesse reggere adeguatamente il confronto.Sono rimasto quasi pienamente soddisfatto. Esteticamente è molto bella, le parti a vista sono rifinite bene, le finiture dell'alluminio e dei tasti sono eccellenti. Un dettaglio, il colore Space Gray SATECHI è molto più chiaro dell'omonimo Space Gray Apple. Un altro paio di piccolezze che mi hanno un po' sorpreso: la parte inferiore/posteriore non è rifinita come la parte frontale a vista e la tastiera è significativamente più pesante dell'omonima Apple Keyboard con il cavo.Per quanto riguarda l'aspetto più importante ovvero il feeling con la tastiera, non siamo ai livelli dell'originale ma ci si avvicina molto. Ci si trova facilmente a proprio agio con la forma dei tasti, tutti hanno la stessa corsa e sensibilità, la risposta è pronta e mai troppo rumorosa. A mio avviso il feeling nel suo insieme è perciò molto buono.Comodi i piccoli led verdi di stato nella parte alta a destra, luminosi ma mai fastidiosi. In circa 1 mese di utilizzo in un paio di volte il led del Caps Lock sembrava non funzionare anche se il relativo tasto era operativo. Al successivo riavvio del computer comunque il problema si è risolto in entrambi i casi. Presumo sia un bug del controller interno della tastiera.La tastiera di per sé meriterebbe 4 stelle su 5 perché tutte queste piccole imprecisioni dovrebbero essere risolte per essere considerato un prodotto impeccabile. Considerando però che l'attuale prezzo di vendita di €59 è di circa il 65% inferiore all'attuale unico modello Magic Keyboard Apple con tastierino numerico (€169 - anche se wireless) la mia recensione non può che essere da 5 stelle."", ""I picked this keyboard up after my loyal Apple extended keyboard crapped out, and I didn't feel like paying the Apple tax on a component that is so susceptible to potential accidents.

The Satechi keyboard has everything that I needed.Fast forward to about 14 months after I made my purchase (which I have been completely satisfied with). A couple of keys started working off and on. Not sure if this is because I have some heavy fingers or what. Keep in mind that all the keyboard was working just fine except for the Left Arrow and the Enter Key on the Keypad. I contacted Satechi support expecting that they would just tell me that I was SOL since the keyboard was past the 1 year warranty. Instead, support was prompt at suggesting some tests, and when we determined that the keyboard was not working, they promptly shipped me a replacement. I was so surprised by the excellent customer service that I decided to write this review to let you guys know just how good of a company this is.So do I have anything negative to say about this keyboard? My biggest gripe is that I wish it had a USB port or two in the back. This would come in handy for thumb drives or even plugging my wireless mouse to recharge. I hope that perhaps in a future update they will consider adding at least one USB port.Other than that, this is an excellent product from a very good company. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others, or buy their products again in the future.""]"

Switches are great but not really what I've expected from a tactile switch. They have a very smooth and round tactile actuation compared to other tactiles with a sharp actuation. Maybe it's just something that you get used to over time. springs could be slightly heavier maybe 65-70g. But I think that the biggest downside is that fact that they absolutely need lubing, process that took me maybe 3-4 hours. I usually avoid unlubed switches and probably will continue to do so. But overall a good tactile switch although not my favorite and unless you want nice RGB, I would probably go with Akko Jelly Purple with much stronger tactilty, and also coming pre-lubed."", 'セールで安くなっていたからパンダ軸を買った。初めて使うからグロリアスのパンダ軸がほかのと比べてどうなのかは言えないけど、この軸単体の評価はできると思う。パンダ軸をパルサーPCMKに差してみた。今までは静音ピンク軸３５g。軽くて誤爆が多いけど、パンダ軸は結構重く感じる。でもすごい重いわけではないからそのうち慣れると思う。音はこもった青軸。知っていたつもりだけど意外と音は大きい。夜は気になるけど感触は結構好きかも。タクタイル感がすごくいい。打っててなんかうまくなった気にさせてくれる感じ。未ルブのものを買ったけど、自分でルブしたので、その辺は買ったものと違うかもしれない。でもアメリカで人気があるのもわかる気がする。星が一つマイナスなのは個数が書いてないところ。レヴューを調べれば書いてあるけど、個数が分からなければ買いづらい。ただパルサーの基盤とはあまり相性が良くない感じ。スイッチがキツキツ、ピンが曲がって２個ダメにしました。ただリピートがあるかというとないだろうと思う。やはり音が気にる。静音から移ったから余計なんだろうけど。', 'キーボードを組み立てる際は２～３箱のスイッチが必要です。１箱に３６個入っているので私みたいに追加オーダーにならないように！笑\u3000やっぱりタクタイルスイッチ好きです。もともとMacやWindowsのキーボードにアタッチされているキーボードを使っていたので感覚が全然違いますね。毎度毎度クリックするたびに指と耳が喜びます笑\u3000潤滑済み？ルブ済み？のスイッチを購入したので変なばねの音とか何もなくてスムーズです。', ""Posés sur un GMMK pro de la même marque, ce sont d'excellents switchs linéaires.

This keyboard has north-facing LEDs, so they are a little dimmer than stock, but I'm good with that, as the typing experience more than makes up for it.Getting to the typing experience, I would put these up there with the Zealio V2 67g switches at roughly the same price, but you can buy these lubed. I would have lubed them myself, but the price difference wasn't worth my time to take the switches apart, lube, re-assemble, and then finally install. The tactile bump is noticeable and pleasant. The switches themselves are quiet, even compared to the Cherry MX Browns that came installed from the factory. It almost feels like typing on bubble wrap, it's super satisfying. Shortly after installing the switches, I took a monkeytype.com test and hit new high scores on the 30-second and 100-word tests. I look forward to what these will be like once I get used to them/they get through their break-in period.To say it's like a completely new keyboard would be overstating the obvious as it technically is a new board at this point.

For Ubuntu, it kind of works out of the box. A few unexpected but amazing features is that The tablet with the screen turned off can work without the power usb plugged in. So if you wanted to change it back to a regular tablet when you ran out of usb ports, you can. In addition, if your usb port supports ss usb or higher power usb port, your screen can power on without the power usb plugged in, which is pretty amazing feature that should be an important feature. This with the size / color of the tablet, the additional tablet gloves (the seller might have gave out an additional one for free, so total 2), pen case, additional pen nips and folding stand just push this tablet to the highly recommended product.Con:There is one minor quality control issue on my tablet protection... whoever did the plastic screen protector left an air bubble including the dust under it on in the screen protector. In the end, I managed to remove the dust with quite a bit of labor and tape, but the screen protector obvious isn't the same afterward. It is a minor problem.  However consider that xp-pen do charge customers quite a lot of money for a new plastic screen protector and this is a quality control defect, I had to put a -1 star to this. Seriously xp-pen, upgrade the screen protector to glass would have been easier for you on quality control. Another thing with the plastic screen protector mention by other users is that your pen will likely scratch the protector and your pen will slide a bit on it, so don't expect too much here. The screen and the pen will have a really small gap, but for users that don't look close to the screen there won't be much problem.Overall:The tablet and the actual goodies - Highly recommendedThe screen protector - hope for the best and you might have avoided bubble in it"", ""besides my ipad, this is my first display tablet so it was a big jump for me !! the tablet works really well, but only after i struggled with setup. i had to reinstall the drivers twice because they just weren't working, and my pen was not calibrating correctly for the longest time, but i got them to work wonderfully and the tablet is now easy and fun to use !! the pen works great now and the display is really crisp and clear, and the colours are really good !! these issues i had might have just been because of my pc, but they were fixable and i got through them eventually. on another note, this tablet would be great for people who are just beginning/people who want to upgrade to an affordable display tablet !! overall, i'm really happy with my purchase even after the issues i had, and i would recommend it to others (:"", 'my first pen tablet where I draw on the screen, works great except for a soft, high pitched buzzing from the screen.', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0El tamaño perfecto, ni excesivamente grande ni pequeña, no hay delay en los trazados y el pulso sale practicamente como en una hoja de papel.

Trascorsi 10 minuti circa, il tappetino diverrá perfettimanente lineare, adeguandosi in modo perfetto alla superficie orizzontale del piano di appoggio.Il tappetino non presenta alcun odore, é molto morbido ed é confortevole poggiare sopra le mani: aderisce bene alla scrivania e rimane ben ancorato. Impossibile quindi che si muova anche accidentalmente e di conseguenza che si muovano accidentalmente mouse e tastiera.Impressioni di utilizzo.Il tappetino ribadisco restiuisce una ottima sensazione tattile, la superifcie é nera e con i riflessi della luce diretta ( lampada da scrivania), appare leggermente metalizzato.Bello esteticamente, gradevole alla vista, di generose dimensioni consente di ospitare mouse e tastiera comodamente e con abbondanza di spazio.Con il mouse con sensore ottico (Steel series Kinzu), il mouse a mio avviso si muove molto fluidamente ed i risultati del test da me eseguito lo confermano.Si ha quindi una sensazione di scorrevolezza del mouse, di velocitá di reazione e di ottimo tracciamento.Con il mouse con il sensore Laser ( Corsair m95) , il mouse, invece, sembra muoversi meno fluidamente e meno velocemente, costringendomi ad aumentare i Dpi, tramite l'apposita funzione del software Corsair in dotazione ocn il mouse m95, oppure ricorrendo all'apposita utility presente sia in Windows 10 ed in windows 7, la quale consente di aumentare la velocitá del mouse.La sensazione che ho avuto utilizzando questo tappetino con il mouse laser, é che esso non si adatti perfettamente ai sensori Laser come confermano i risultati del mio test, perché per raggiungere una parte del desktop sono costtretto a muovere il mouse molto di piu'di quanto avvenga con il sensore ottico, rendendo piu'disagevole l'utilizzo e diciamo tra virgolette, ma molte virgolette,  piu' faticoso l'utilizzo del mouse Laser.Se il tappetino in questione ovvero la sua duplice faccia che varia in funzione del tipo di sensore del mouse che utilizzate, restituisce indubbiamente una sensazione di minore scorrevolezza durante l'utilizzo normale del pc ( navigazione web, office, multimedialitá), é pur vero che quando si utlizza il mousepad con un sensore laser  in ambito videoludico ( videogiochi vari), detta minore scorrevolezza si traduce in maggiore precisione del tracciamento pertanto vi risulterá piu'agevole cecchinare o ruotare la telecamera del videogioco di 180 gradi perché sará necessario muovere in modo netto il mouse Laser  per voltarvi di 180 gradi oppure di 360 gradi, mentre con il mouse ottico lo stesso movimento viene eseguito con minimo spostamento del mouse sul tappetino, costringendovi ( almeno questa é la mia esperienza), ad abbassare la fluiditá del mouse nelle impostazioni del singolo videogico e dall'apposita pannello di controllo dell'applicazione.Risultati del testCon il software di cui vi ho parlato, é emerso che questo tappetino in tessuto é ottimo con i sensori Laser con i quali si raggiunge una superficie di tracciamento ottima.Lo stesso  risultato non si raggiunge con il sensore laser dove il software restiuisce un risultato di tracciamento sotto il livello ottimale e pari diciamo solo al livello buonoHo quiundi eseguito una prova del mouse Laser in mio possesso e del mouse ottico su un tappetino in metallo-alluminio sempre della Corsair ovvero il MM600  Con questo tappetino il mouse laser raggiunge livelli ottimi di traccimanento ed il mouse ottico raggiunge solo il livello buono.Ribadsico che il problema é superabile , aumentando i dpi del mouse qualora abbiate una periferica hardware dotata di questa fuznione, o, in caso contrario, utilizzare l'apposita utility presente nativamente dentro i sistemi Microsoft.ConclusioniSi tratta di un tappetino adatto ai mouse con sensore ottico e non si sfrutta in maniera ottimale con i sensori Laser.ConsigliatoSi se avete un mouse otticoDa valutare= se avete un mouse laser ,Tenete in considerazione che questo tappetino ha un costo di circa 40 euro e che un tappetino in alluminio sempre della Corsair costa piu' o meno la stessa cifra, ma restiuisce una sensazione di fluiditá e manegevolezza del mouse laser, imparagonabile a quella che vi fornisce un mousepad in tessuto.A mio giudizio 40 euro per un tappetino sono tanti soldi, quindi non vi consiglierei di acquistare un tappetino in alluminio peraltro dalle dimensioni standard se, pur avendo un mouse laser, non abbiate utilizzi specifici del mouse quali possono essere il foto editing o il videoediting oppure l'utilizzo con i giochi, nei quali il mousepad in alluminio fonrisce il massimo rispetto ad un mousepad in tessuto che, ribadisco per utilizzi generici, comunque va piu' che bene.40 Euro sono tanti anche per un tappetino in tessuto ma in questo caso, avete una superficie decisamente ampia sulla quale riporrete sia mouse che tastiera oltre che guadagnare un notevole effetto estetico della postazione pc. Se tuttavia utilizzerete in questo caso un mouse laser, perderete qualcosa in termini di fluiditá del mouse.Perché tre stelle?E' un buon prodotto, ma a mio avviso , un po' tropoo caro e quinidi  non ottimale dal punto di vista del rapporto prezzo-prestazioni  se utilizzato con mouse laser. Per un prodotto di questa caratura economica avrei voluto un mousepad che fosse ottimo con tutti i tipi di sensore e non solo con quelli ottici. Ad onor del vero, vi é da dire, tuttavia, che, qualsiasi recensioni tecnica e specializzata di settore, non consiglia mai mousepad in tessuto per l'utilizzo ottimale di sensori Laser  Ad ogni modo , mi sembrava corretto evidenziare questo aspetto del tappetino il quale restiuisce diffferenti esperienze di utilizzo del mouse Laser e di quello ottico, a paritá di dpi o comunque a paritá di velocitá del mouse previamente impostata tramite appositá utility  i Windows.p.s: il video é registrato in ful hd, ma alcune volte, dop averlo caricato su Amazon il video viene scalato a risoluzioni inferiori , pertanto é consigliabile guardarlo in finestra senza metterlo a schermo intero ( fate una prova nel caso abbiate problemi di visualizzazione non chiara o nitida).LogoIl logo é quello tradizionale della Corsair, ovvero la nave pirata e nella parte uinferiore presenta una linea gialla orizzontale che corre per tutta la lunghezza del tappetinoTest eseguiti.Ho provato il tappetino con il mouse Kinzu della Stell series il quale é dotato di sensore ottico.La prova e' stata eseguita utilizzando il software della Corsair il quale mi é stato fornito insieme al mouse Laser Corsair m95.Il software ha lo scopo di testare la bontá delel supeficie su cui viene adagiato il mouse al fine di testarne la capacitá di tracciamento.Risultati"", 'bueno', 'Gets dusty very quickly, and over years of use has got fine bits of dust or something smeared all over it. the edges and bottom side have crinkled up and no longer are flat. Not really worth more than £10', 'Habe mir das Mousepad in der größten und aktuellsten (3. Generation) Version gekauft und nutze es nun seit einigen Tagen. Ich habe nun Maus und Tastatur auf dem Pad was ich persönlich als sehr angenehm empfinde. Das Mousepad löst das Roccat Taito King Size ab. Ich nutze es mit der M65 Maus von Corsair und spiele Dota 2 sowie Star Wars Battlefront.Funktion: Das Pad ist relativ flach (3mm) die ""Polsterung"" vom Handgelenk ist somit so gut wie bei anderen dickeren Stoffpads es ist dadurch aber auch etwas leichter und lässt sich einfacher transportieren (sofern man dies vorhat). Die Oberfläche ist sehr weich und glatt, sodass die Maus perfekt gleitet. Bei einem Oberflächen Test von der M65 Maus wurden 4.5/5 möglichen Punkten erreicht -> Vergleich zu meinem 2 Jahre gebrauchten Taito (1.5/5 Punkten). Ich werde den Test alle paar Monate wiederholen um zu überprüfen ob und wie schnell die Qualität mit der Zeit abnimmt.Design: Mir gefällt in der aktuellen Version das schlichte Design mit dem gelben Strich am unteren Rand und dem Logo in der Mitte. Farbige Mousepads von Razer sagen mir persönlich nicht zu.Größe: Wie bereits in der Einleitung geschrieben habe ich mich für die größte Variante entschieden um Maus und Tastatur gemeinsam auf dem Mousepad zu haben, da mein Schreibtisch nicht so groß ist war dies für mich eines der entscheidenden Kaufkriterien, da ich nun Maus und Tastatur effektiv dichter zusammenstellen kann als vorher. Die Breite ist perfekt für alle die kein überbreites Keyboard haben. Für meinen Geschmack hätte es noch etwas höher und dicker sein können aber da hat jeder ein eigenes Empfinden.Geruch: Eigentlich ein Punkt den ich nicht bei einer Bewertung von einem Mousepad als relevant ansehe aber da es hier in den Bewertungen bereits mehrfach angesprochen wurde nehme ich es ihn mit auf. Jeder Mensch reagiert anders auf Gerüche so kann ich auch nur hier mein subjektiven Eindruck schildern. Was ich in jedem Fall bestätigen kann ist, dass das Mousepad einen recht starken Geruch verströmt sobald man es aus der Verpackung nimmt. Meiner Meinung nach riecht es eher etwas verbrannt als ""chemisch"". Ich habe das Mousepad für einen Tag auf dem Balkon gelassen und es dann direkt auf meinen Schreibtisch gelegt. Der Geruch ist noch wahrnehmbar jedoch längst nicht so stark wie am Anfang. Ich habe meine alten Stoffpads 1x im Jahr gewaschen und ganz kurz übergebügelt um die Oberfläche wieder zu ""refreshen"" der Geruch der dabei entsteht ist sehr ähnlich also tippe ich mal, dass Corsair die Oberfläche ebenfalls mit Hitze behandelt wird. Kopfschmerzen oder ähnliches habe ich auch nach mehreren Stunden nicht bekommen jedoch reagiert hier jeder sicherlich anders. Ich hätte dem Mousepad tatsächlich 5/5 Sterne gegeben wenn der Geruch nicht ganz so dominant gewesen wäre. Falls der Geruch auch in einigen Wochen noch nicht verschwunden sein sollte werde ich das hier noch einmal entsprechend vermerken.Fazit: Objektiv ein sehr gutes Mousepad mit einem schönen schlichten Design und besten Gleiteigenschaften und einer guten Polsterung. Einziges echtes Manko ist der starke Geruch der direkt nach dem Auspacken wirklich alles andere als angenehm ist.', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Tamaño perfecto, desliza bien.Tiene un problema que a mi me molesta y es que a los 3 meses los bordes se descosen; me da manía.

I've used it playing one game, Subnautica. So far it has been great for gaming. I was able to figure out how to control the RGB fairly easy. It's not apparently obvious that you need to plug it in and install the software to really control the keyboard lighting and bindings and such. For the game, it was good to go out of the box. Subnautica doesn't really use specialized keybindings. Pretty uncomplicated. I got some pudding keycaps from Redragon and changed some of the keycaps to make certain keys even easier to spot quickly.The one downside I found was when I was using it to control media volume. I pretty easily assigned two of the G macro keys to be volume +/-. The space bar would play/pause, super easy. My problem happened when I was kicked back in my recliner watching YouTube on the connected flat screen.Let me set the scene. I am recovering from a foot wound and have to keep it elevated as much as possible. So we put wheels on my desk (it's an adjustable desk from IKEA, very simple desk... I love it!) so I could move it around. We moved my recliner into the area so I could kick back, raise my desk up and pull it up to my chair mostly. So I sit with my feet up but still under the desk. The desk is still far enough back that I can't reach the desktop easily. I move the keyboard to my lap for easy control and the mouse to the arm rest. My old corded keyboard could reach, so you have an idea of the distance.Anyway, when this keyboard is in my lap or just off the desk, it won't work. It loses connection with the dongle. I have found that even if there is something between this keyboard and the dongle it will lose connection. If I had a different arrangement, this would be a deal breaker. I have a gaming laptop which sits on the desk with an attached flat screen as a secondary monitor. The dongle for this keyboard is plugged into a USB multiport adapter. Not hidden behind anything. The USB port is on the right side of the laptop and the game keyboard is used left handed but usually sits in front of the laptop so I can use my left hand and be comfortable positioned in front of the flat screen. So mostly to the middle/right of my desk. In one photo you see my desk with this keyboard on the right, between the laptop just under the left edge of the monitor is the USB multiport where the dongle is plugged in and then the mouse over to the right. In the second photo you see a corded xbox controller blocking the USB multiport. That is enough to disrupt the connection and keyboard will not work. An no, the controller is not plugged in, its just sitting there.So all that is to say If I had a desktop that sat under the desk, this keyboard would be unusable. Otherwise I'm completely satisfied with it and the Redragon pudding keycaps."", ""J'ai pris les switchs marrons, et contrairement au commentaire français de Martin Ascola du 10/02/22, mes touches sont très réactives, pas besoin de les enfoncer complètement pour qu'elles soient prise en compte.Pour la touche espace, je n'ai aucun soucie à l'atteindre avec le pouce, et pourtant j'ai des mains moyennes, voir même petites dit-on pour l'adulte que je suis.De plus, je trouve que ces touches sont assez silencieuses pour un clavier méca.Dans la boite,sont fourni un beau câble usb-c/usb de 1m80, 4 ou 5 switchs de rechanges, 2 outils pour décrocher les touches, et le d'ongle usb 2.4ghz.Passons, à la partie logiciel...Pour le récupérer, il faut aller sur le site global international en anglais, à ce jour c'est le 'www point redragonzone point com', aller à l'onglet Download, sélectionner la rubrique Keyboard (clavier), et bien prendre la version wireless (sans fil) du ReDragon K585.Une fois installer, il faut allumer et brancher le clavier avec le câble usb fourni pour que le logiciel se lance.D'ailleurs le clavier fonctionne très bien en filaire, si on est à cours de batterie.Le K585 est censé avoir 5 touches programmables de G1 à G5, en fait, surement depuis le dernier firmware (v2), le K585 a maintenant 7 touches modifiables.(Et pour moi, le firmwre était à jour en sortie de boite)G6 est la touche apostrophe en dessous de EscG7 est la touche T du clavierLa touche en haut à droite avec une l'icone de planète, donne la touche Virgule (,) sur nos clavier azerty Français, donc la touche M en qwerty, M qui est souvent attribué à la Map (carte) dans les jeux...Mes découvertes, après 1h d'utilisation :- On peut créer autant de profiles que l'on veut par le biais de l'import/export- 5 profiles sont accessibles et chargés dans le logiciel.- 5 profiles mais 4 modes pour chaque profile avec des paramétrages différents dans chaque mode.- soit 20 configurations possible max, et non 5, accessible dans le logiciel.- Quand on affecte une touche particulière avec 'Keyboard Keys' il faut bien renseigner le champ 'Speed', sinon, si on laisse 'Speed' sur 1, on aura la répétition de la touche lors de la frappe. Exemple, pour paramétrer en jeu une lampe torche, j'ai mis la touche L sur G1, avec le 'Speed' de L à 150.- Quand les touches G1 à G5 sont sur 'Buttton Off', elle sont actives et ont les fonctions des touches F1 à F5.- Si on débranche le clavier pour l'utiliser en sans-fil, l'interface logiciel se ferme, et son icone, dans la barre de notification en bas à droite, passe du rouge au gris. Mais surtout le clavier ne fonctionnera plus. Mais pas de panique, il faut l'étendre par l'interrupteur 'off' arrière et le rallumer 'on'. Là, le mode et le profile affiché au moment  de la déconnection seront actif.- Le clavier avec l'interrupteur sur 'off' mais branché en usb, fonctionne par contre !- Je n'ai pas encore cherché pour savoir si c'est possible de changer de profile et/ou de mode, sans être relié au PC par câble.- Et pas encore compris la logique et l'intérêt du fonctionnement de M1 à M4, et comment les modifier avec REC.Bugs :- J'ai remarqué qu'en essayant les paramètres de lumière et voulant ' Save', l'application pouvait se bloquer ; il faut alors tuer le processus manuellement dans le gestionnaire de taches (raccourci bouton droit sur la barre d'outil de windows 10) et  relancer l'appli."", ""I really like that the Redragon software is lightweight and isn't bloated and full of superfluous features. The only dislike I have is that you can't name the profiles. If they would add the ability to name the profiles this would be a 5-star review.My other small complaint is the the power switch is located in place that's difficult to reach. Also the power switch is recessed and not easily switched on and off.Overall it's a good device and it's replaced my gaming keypad from one of the big name peripheral companies. Unlike the device I replaced, the Redragon K585 connects reliably every time through the wireless dongle or the USB cable."", 'I only left 4 stars because if i use a wireless mouse with this keypad it has a lot of very annoying interference issues. Other than that it is fantastic, good quality plastics and does not feel super thin or low quality like I expected. I will be using this for a long time...Hopefully, but if it were to break while travelling or jut kick the bucket I would 100% buy the same exact one.', ""It all feels great! My only thing is that the spacebar is a little further out than it would be on a regular keyboard. Not a big deal to adjust my thumb position, but I did miss it a few times at first. Overall I'm really happy I picked this up, I use it every day for gaming, and I plan on using it for many years to come!"", ""Once I got the supporting software to work with Windows 11 I haven't had a problem. It is an excellent piece of equipment that now does exactly what I bought it for."", 'Die Software zum Tasten umprogrammieren funktioniert. Die Tastatur ist solide gebaut. Die blauen mechanisch Tasten geben ein gutes Feedback. Kleiner Abzug in der B-Note, da man Stabilisatoren für die größeren Tasten hätte ergänzen können. Diese werden aktuell jeweils nur von einem Taster gehalten.', ""This keyboard is everything they claim it is. I find it comfortable with a good range. It is great for gaming instead of using my laptops keyboard. The only problem I have is that after first using this keyboard and then unplugging it to use on my Dell laptop I lose use of 4 keys on my laptop keyboard now, they are all in a diagonal line 1,q,a,z.  Don't know what the conflict is. They were working before I used this keyboard.

I really liked how perixx held up under my frantic gaming hands, and got this one as it was the most similar to my last one. Well.... It's not adjustable, the backlight is not automatic and requires being manually pressed each time it's powered on, and the keys are just a little different than the usual perixx layout. The caps lock button is very large, which is fine for probably everyone else but after being used to perixx small caps lock, it seems so weird. The caps lock is bigger than the enter key, so that stands out. This is programmed for PC tho which is nice because the F keys on pc keyboards are usually grouped in 4s which is uncomfortable for gaming. So I usually had to use MAC Keyboards and they don't have the same key layout, so previously, I wasn't able to use the print screen button, as print screen was prog onto something else that I could never remember. But this one is great, press print screen and the button does a screenshot.

Star removed for each."", ""soft click, White Backlit super helpful at night, very it's not heavy and the size is great, the desk looks cleaner :)"", 'Absolute NO GO! Do NOT buy this keyboard ! Already on the second day the keyboard started typing ""9"" endlessly. No matter what I did, it didn\'t want to stop generating ""9"". The keys were not stuck! So it was either the contact foil or some software error of the keyboard. I don\'t know if numpad key ""9"" or the main key ""9"" was at fault, none were blocked. Turning off the keyboard helped for a few moments, but then while typing any normal text, suddenly and randomly it would start again writing the endless ""9"" rows. The kyboard design itself is ok, and the price is also ok. But what use if it does not work normally? I wonder how it passed through Quality Control?? How is Perixx able to hand out a product without going throught the production checks? It was in waranty, but sending it back to Amazon on own cost would have been too expensive. On day 3, after countles trials, being completely frustrated and disappointed, I have smashed the keyboard to pieces on the desk\'s corner (see pic attached). Waste of money! What a shame! Forget Perixx, they can\'t guarantee a correct manufacturing. (Ich hab auf Englisch geschrieben weil mein Deustch leider nicht so gut ist.

LO BUENO: Teclado; es cómodo y funcional, el teclado iluminado le da un toque de genialidad, tiene 3 colors a elección, la batería dura en promedio 3 días con retroalimentación activada, en jornadas mixtas de entre 8-12hrs continuas, los botones de música son prácticos, aunque solo los use para probar que funcionaban. Trackpad; el scroll es lo que más uso y funciona muy bien, el muy sensible así que en ocaciones prefiero desactivarlo, los botones no hacen clic pero funcionan bien. LO MALO: Teclado: las teclas son un poco más reducidas de lo habitual y aunque son cómodas para escribir a veces siento que están demasiado pequeñas, el material es plástico rígido pero se sienten un poco frágiles, inclusive tuve que hacer uso de la garantía para cambiar el teclado, la retro iluminación no es del todo homogénea, y dependiendo el color es más intenso uno que el otro, el verde es el más intenso, rojo le sigue y por último el azul. TrackPad; es muy sensible al tacto pero se mueve muy lento el puntero, no tiene las mismas funciones que un trackpad común como arrastrar un objeto a veces funciona o aveces no, los botones no hacen clic y eso como UX no es muy convincente.LA CARGA: pues aún te trae una extensión aún así es muy corto el cable, tarda aproximadamente 3hr en cargar completamente con un cargador de 5v, los testigos de alertas no son lo mejor pero por lo menos indican que se está acabando la batería o que se está cargando, te avisa que está conectado y que está activo el bloqueo de mayúsculas.En general es bueno bonito y barato con muy buena vista pero no es la mejor calidad que hubiera esperado, lo ventaja es que me hicieron válida la garantía y me cambiaron por un teclado nuevo al día siguiente, ahí es cuando note la diferencia de un producto nuevo y uno que parecía usado y muy maltratado, no se por que el primer producto que me enviaron parecía de segunda mano, la batería no duraba nada, venía rota la tecla Enter y los leds del teclado estaban muy raros unos brillaban demasiado y otros apenas si se veían, eso sin mencionar que los acabados del material parecían todos opacos y como usados. Y cuando me enviaron uno nuevo wow! Vaya sorpresa y la diferencia de todo lo mencionado anteriormente.Update: por error descubrí para que es el botón verde con el icono de “mouse” al parecer su función es la de hacer clic sostenido como si fuera una extensión de tu mouse, es decir usando el trackpad das clic con ese botón y puedes arrastrar el o varios objetos.', ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0I like the key action on this wireless keyboard mouse combo. I seem to make less typing mistakes when in awkward positions. However, the trackpad is less sensitive to what I am used to. The scroll wheel option that uses the sliding action off to the right side with one finger doesn't work very well. Also using two fingers to scroll up and down doesn't work very well and often causes it to instead zoom in and out and vice versa. The trackpad is not very responsive and causes the mouse pointer to move slowly and sluggishly, and sometimes not move at all.I quickly disconnected this keyboard and went back to my Logitech K400 plus. I wanted to keep this keyboard in service because it had the keyboard that lights up. I like that idea because sometimes I have all lights off in my room and when I want to make a commentary, it would be nice to have this functionality. However, the poor functionality of the trackpad far outweighed my need for a keyboard that lights up. I have chosen not to return this keyboard and instead moved it to a room where I less often have use for a keyboard mouse combo.The Logitech k400 remains number one out of all the the wireless keyboard mouse combo  keyboards I've tried.☮️💝✌️"", ""I like the keyboard and mouse but not so much the mouse keys. Sometimes I don't even know I've touched them because there is no real tactile feel or pressure there. Most of the time I simply do a double click on the mouse trackpad to bypass the buttons. Another keyboard I have that is almost identical and may even be the same maker has harder to press mouse buttons so I do know when I have pressed those. Maybe it's just a fluke or a bad batch of mouse pads."", ""Small Update: After using a little more I've noticed the touch pad is somewhat sensitive (as far as left click/tap) so sometimes you might accidentally click stuff occasionally. I mostly use the left click button on the top left corner of the keyboard because of this reason. Still not a bad keyboard though.Built my son a PC for his 5th birthday and since he can't spell he didn't need a fancy keyboard just yet and being wireless just keeps the clutter away. This thing works just fine for some occasional use like maybe for an HTPC or just sitting back browsing the web but if you need a keyboard to do actual WORK on, just do yourself a favor and spend the extra for a nicer quality.I have 3 different wireless keyboard/trackpads and honestly I think typing feels best on this one, I actually kinda prefer it over my Logitech (not to mention this is the only backlit one which I really enjoy though unfortunately it only comes on white when you turn it on but then changes colors... only let's you choose red, green, or blue? I just wanted white but no big deal). The one thing I absolutely HATE about this thing, and I've made the mistake in the past so I knew what I was getting in to before I even ordered, was that stupid right Shift key. I always use the right Shift when typing but on this keyboard it's just a tiny little button so if I need to hit the Shift I usually have to look down first but luckily it doesn't get much use right now until my little man gets older but we'll look into something nicer when the time comes.§The trackpad isn't too bad either, ~~I don't feel that it's too sensitive or anything~~ although I kinda wish the left and right clicks were actual physical buttons but I guess I can't complain especially for the price.So basically: do you type a lot and need something to do real work with? Skip this. Have an HTPC or something that just needs the occasional input? This might just be your guy."", 'If you are looking for a right sized Bluetooth keyboard this one is it. It’s a cool looking gadget with style and presence. Easy to connect to your tv set, nothing like just typing into your browser on your connected device and bam.

Now, just have a USB brick connected to your wall, plug it in when its not in use, and always have it charged 100% whenever you want to use it. Lights are bright enough to see in the dark. Easy to use function keys. Touchpad isn't terrible and the side scroll works surprisingly well.Only thing is I cant confirm the reliability, but so far everything works pretty well."", 'So loving this keyboard! I like them so much I now have 3 of them. Of course these are not for every one and every use. To me they are well made and look great. So much better than the cheapie keyboards. They work just fantastic. Just so happy with them.I picked these up to use on my TV\'s. Maybe it\'s because I am older, but I dislike ""typing"" on a remote. It\'s just a pain if you ask me, and takes so much longer. These are perfect because they have a keyboard and mouse in one small unit. I will say, the small mouse pad takes a little getting use to, but it\'s not that bad. I of course was expecting the pad to be small, so not a knock on the product, just giving my thoughts. Besides that I love it.Funny, in writing this review, the amazon system ask for a rating for gaming. Just not a gaming keyboard to me. Probably work, but not the best setup. Only my opinion.Very happy, good price, would gladly recommend!', 'It\'s hard to judge the size of these things from the internet. This is about 15% smaller than the Microsoft All-in-One Media Keyboard which I had been using for the last couple years in the living room. That doesn\'t sound like a lot, but the MS keyboard is already about 15% smaller than standard. Also, the two finger scrolling is opposite the way the MS keyboard works (and I think most trackpads). And I miss the volume buttons. It makes me realize the things I really like about the MS keyboard. Don\'t get me wrong, I don\'t ""love"" the MS keyboard. This one is more responsive and trackpad mouse tracking is smoother and the battery is rechargeable and the backlighting is nice. I wish I could have that combined with the MS layout.']"

Los switches son bastante buenos y super responsivos lo cual puede ser una ventaja si buscas que responda sin casi aplicar fuerza de una manera rapida, pero tambien puede ser algo de desagrado si no estas acomstumbrado, ya que al necesitar tan poco peso para presionarse es comun que al inicio presiones varias veces por accidente algo que no quieres, solo es cuestion de acostumbrarse. Lo que es tal cual la base del teclado es de muy buena calidad, es de un tipo aluminio que se siente muy rigido y es bastante pesado por lo que no habra ningun problema con que el teclado se ande deslizando por la mesa. Aqui llegamos a mi punto favorito, la iluminacion, esta es super buena el nivel de intensidad es bastante acertado ya que se puede controlar y llega desde el apagado a muy brillante, ademas de que su rgb es de los mejores, ya que con el sofware de icue puedes personalizarlo de manera extrema podiendo cambiar tecla por tecla el color y tiene una gama de colores casi que infinita.Los puntos que si hay que notar es que a pesar de ser un teclado de perfil bajo, al no traer reposamuñecas se llega a sentir incomo despues de varias horas de uso continuo; otro punto a notar es que siendo alambrico es un punto a restar el que no traiga filtro de ferrita.Pero en conclusiones generales es un excelente teclado por su precio ademas de ser de una marca muy reconocida la cual casi que significa calidad.', 'The keys on this particular model of keyboard are extremely sensitive to touch, I\'ve had to disable the context menu key and the windows key because of this. However, this is a fantastic keyboard so far.The keys feel great, responsive, and even though it\'s marketed as a ""quiet"" keyboard, it does have a nice clicking sound while typing because I bottom the keys out.Pros:Responsive, well built switches.Keys feel very nice under the fingertips while typing, pretty natural sensations.Rock solid construction, it\'s got some heft to it and feels pretty durable.Backlighting is second to none, it\'s bright, colorful and is appealing.Cons:Sensitivity is off the charts, lightly grazing a key while typing can cause mis-strokes almost immediately, this keyboard is not for touch typing.iCue software takes up over a gig in space.Will probably update this review in a few weeks to share more feedback once I\'ve gotten used to it.', 'TL;DR: Some minor things that don\'t detract from the amazing price point if bought ""used - like new.""I got this keyboard ""used - like new"" for $42 (incl. tax). It arrived in the original box; though the outside packaging was a bit damaged, the keyboard was still wrapped and looked completely untouched to me. Some background: college CS student, gamer, ~100wpm if it means anything. Have been using this keyboard (my first mechanical one) for 3 months now.Pros:- RBG lighting - no clunky software needed, various options all controlled via the F keys. I really didn\'t think I\'d enjoy the lighting but have definitely grown to appreciate it.- Great for gaming - keys are very responsive and I do think it makes a difference (coming from a regular membrane keyboard)- Seems study/durable - basically no signs of wear and tear after 3 months (though I have been doing my best to keep it in good condition on my part)- Price - I paid $40 for what was essentially a new $100 keyboardCons:- The cherry viola switches are kind of loud, the spacebar in particular - haven\'t gotten complaints when using Discord or Zoom (since they have good background noise filtering), but it\'s definitely very audible in-person if you\'re not being careful- Not hot-swappable- Rather sensitive keys; I find myself accidentally typing the same key twice or more sometimes (but you do get used to it)Other:- Keys come off quite easily, you don\'t even really need to use a keycap puller - could be good or bad? It was convenient for me when I was putting o-rings on my keys to make them a little quieter. I haven\'t pulled any off accidentally, but I\'d be careful when handling/moving it around.Overall, for ~$40 - an amazing deal. I still see ""used - like new"" options for <40, so I\'d definitely recommend picking it up!', ""Works well. I've used Corsair before and this is a good keyboard. My only annoyance is that it's a US layout, not UK.

My regular keyboard had the W key sticking which was how you moved forward.  So I was looking for a gaming keyboard.  The Corsair K60 RGB keyboard is great as your first gaming keyboard.The good: Full size and 104 keys which includes the number keypad.  I use this also for office work.  I do not understand the allure of a small tiny keyboard.  Sturdy materials.  No loud mechanical keys.  Customizable with iCUE software (free download).  For me I wanted to have the main Mech Arena game keys all 1 color.  It took me a Youtube to figure it out but I did and it works great.  You do not have to leave the software running once you set it up.The bad:  media keys are function keys.  I would had preferred separate media keys and a volume knob.The ugly: I keep hitting the caps key as it is next to the 'A' key which is a move left button on my game.  No wrist pad.  iCUE software is not intuitive, but there are Youtubes you can use to help you.Summary: For $50  you get a sturdy, customizable gaming keyboard suitable for the office.  You could pay $150 or more for the top of the line, but this works just fine."", 'Update after a month of use for typing and programming:When it comes to typing and other textual documentation, I like the the apple keyboard since, that\'s much faster as there is little movement of fingers required.However when it comes to coding, since one would be pressing multiple (combination keys) at once, a lot; mac keyboard fails here as it\'s hard to hit the keys right without looking at the keyboard.  Membrane keyboards better but the mechanical keyboards the best since one can feel the keys the best without accidentally pressing them.I liked the brown keys keyboard that I used earlier, the good this with this particular K60 from Corsair is, it\'s a lot silent than the cherry mx keys, so I can enjoy my music playing on the desktop speakers while typing.Only thing that I didn\'t like that much on this keyboard is, the actuation distance is very short, like 1mm, which is apt for gaming for typing, when I rest keys, I need to ensure that I don\'t press the keys accidentally (there is not tactile for actuation). I kind of got used to it.Below is the recommendation:Not recommended if you- like clicky sound- use this for typing AND have heavy handsRecommended if you- like more silent keyboard (as silent as a membrane keyboard)- quick actuation (gaming/ arrow key navigation etc)- for coding and do not have heavy fingers (so you avoid accidental actuation)- for typing and  do not have heavy fingers- like funky full-color back lights (this keyboard has best back-lighting)The space-bar was noisy, I noticed this is happening at the time of releasing the key fast, the momentum of the space bar hitting the pasting limiter/stoppers on the top. I fixed it by pasting some petroleum jelly between the metal supporters and plastic groves/limiter that are on the either ends of the space-bars, and not to the mechanical transparent switch.  Now the space bar is as pleasant as the ""enter"" key.Hardening silicone gel is another option, but I couldn\'t locate that on time. If you use silicone, you need to be super precise with it as you don\'t want to obstruct the motion of the keys with hardened silicone.I am getting one more of K60 RGB Pro SE for my 5th grader daughter, cuz I like this keyboard for my needs and she likes it too bumping up to 5 star.I can provide pictures.------------------Update after a week of heavy use:This *sounds* more pleasing than the brown keys. Keys still feel harder to bottom out (I know keys don\'t change but I can get used to it). The actuation point is roughly at 1mm, so there is no need to bottom out the keys except for a sense of satisfaction.Still keeping 4 stars.  Would upgrade to 5 stars when/if this becomes my go to keyboard and when I start recommending to my friends.  Currently I still recommend a keyboard with ""brown keys"" for typing use.Original Review:Cherry MV (MX Viola) Keys (transparent ones) - not blue, brown, red. Feels like a variant of MX Red. Should be better than MX Red when it comes to gaming.This keyboard was a total surprise to me, in a good way and a bad way both.Softer than expected.Heavier than expected.Colors look cooler than expected.Space bar more wiggly and noisy than expected.Quality of material, better than expected.Ergo - rather a flat keyboard - not as expected.Wrist pad ---  integrated magnetic wrist pad is better than an independent one.Hopefully I will get used to it soon.This is a next level of engineering, I don\'t know if the effect is good or bad, so far so go. Will update the review after a few 1000s of lines of code.', ""Decent build quality, not loud keys (kinda chatty but not loud vs standard cherry reds), low profile keys (not very many options for low profile keyboards that's mechanical), with good RGB lighting.No physical media keys and there is a slight learning curve as the feel is slightly.... springy? squishy? and sensitive so might press a key too fast.my left ctrl key is meh, playing FPS games it's usually binded for crouch, if it's not toggle based even though you're pressing it, you're character stands up. Kinda annoying and idk if it's the keyboard or the game.As a long time logitech consumer and being disappointed with their recent keyboards. This is nice without the premium price tag. Idk  yet about durability but my logitech boards had a couple of keys that died.Software is better than logitech (or razer, won't get anything that force installs software) and I don't need it to use it."", 'Llegó perfecto el producto y el tiempo que llevo usándolo responde perfecto le e quitado y puesto las teclas y sin tema solo tengan cuidado no las jalen más de un lado o tan fuerte, responde muy bien y rápido es buen teclado']"

Let's start with the positive aspects: the design of the keyboard is aesthetically pleasing and the mouse worked exceptionally well. The setup process was a breeze, just insert AA batteries, and you're good to go. The convenience of a wireless combo cannot be understated, allowing for clutter-free and flexible usage.However, my overall satisfaction was somewhat hindered by a major issue with the keyboard. I found that you had to hit the keys exactly in the middle for them to register properly. This drawback became frustrating as it impacted typing accuracy, causing me to retype certain characters repeatedly. I expected a smoother typing experience, and this particular flaw was a letdown.The mouse, on the other hand, did not share the same issue and functioned seamlessly. It was responsive and precise, making it a pleasure to use for work and casual browsing.Despite the easy setup and pleasing design, the keyboard's key sensitivity issue forced me to return the product. While the mouse performed admirably, the overall experience was marred by the keyboard's limitations. If you prioritize typing comfort and accuracy in a wireless keyboard, this combo may not be the ideal choice.In conclusion, the Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo had its strengths, like a pleasing design and a well-performing mouse. However, the keyboard's demanding key sensitivity ultimately led to my decision to return it. If you don't mind adjusting your typing style to accommodate this quirk, the combo could still be a suitable option. For those seeking a more forgiving and seamless typing experience, it might be worth exploring other options on the market."", 'It works when a Logitech keyboard does not - for me.

La calidad es buena, la tela es agradable y viene bien sellada, y es antideslizante.Una pega es que al ser de un color claro, se mancha más. Cuando cae líquido se queda primero la gotita encima, y luego se absorve, pero si cae algo que mancha por rápido que se limpie algo marcará. No la recomendaría para niños muy pequeños ni para gente que come en el escritorio. Las marcas de apoyar la mano para usar el ratón/teclado también se ensucia y aparece con relativa facilidad.Otra ""pega"" es que es muy blanda para escribir. Mucha gente lo ha mencionado. No es un cubre-escritorio, sino una alfombrilla, lo que implica que es acolchada. Por ello la recomiendo especialmente para escritorios grandes, en los que se respete un espacio para ello. Yo tebo apoyarme en algo duro o apartar la alfombrilla cuando quiero tomar notas, ya que sino el boli atraviesa el papel por lo blanda que es.Finalmente, para resolver las dudas de muchos y que yo misma tenía, SÍ, SE PUEDE LAVAR EN LA LAVADORA. Me la jugué, lo probé, y ha quedado perfecta. Use jabón de ropa delicada (ninguna marca en concreto, el mío es la marca blanca del super) y evité utilizar suavizante. La lave en un lavado rápido, en FRÍO y sin centrifugado (en mi lavadora fueron poco más de 5 minutos). También decir que la metí sola en la lavadora, sin otras prendas ni obtejos, para evitar dañar la tela.Dado que tenía bastantes manchas antes la lavé a mano. Para ello volví a usar agua fría y el mismo jabón, y la empapé bien. Para frotar usé un cepillo de silicona, he leído que productos para limpiar tapicería van también bien, pero no los he probado. Casi no hizó espuma, y tuve que frotar bastante, pero quedó bien. Finalmente solo se resistieron un par de manchas de tinta que solo se ven si te fijas mucho (otro día utilizare quitamanchas en estos puntos difíciles).IMPORTANTE: NO USAR CALOR. Ni agua caliente, ni secadora, ni secador... Yo ni siquiera la puse a secar al sol, sino en interior (siendo verano tardo algo más de 24h en secar). Las alfombrillas resisten mal el calor, y esto podría provocar que la tela se despegue de la almohadilla negra, así que mucho cuidado ya que podría echarse a perder.En mi caso ha quedado perfecta, como nueva. No se nota ninguna mancha y los colores no han desteñido. La tela tampoco ha perdido suavidad.

Disappointed that such a product will die so quickly', 'While the build quality is good (no rubber grips), rather sad that a relatively expensive mouse from Steelseries, known for its durability, is already facing issues barely 5 months in.', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0En primer lugar me gustaría decir que es mi primer periférico steel series y el primer mouse inalámbrico que tengo.Vengo de encadenar 2 Razer DeathAdder V2 y anteriormente el V1, modelo del que me daba mucho miedo despegarme ya que es, con diferencia, el ratón más cómodo que he tenido.Además de eso, el cambio a inalámbrico me daba miedo por tema tiempos de respuesta, desconexiones, duración de batería, etc.Bien, yendo por partes:- Comodidad: para mi no ha supuesto una diferencia muy grande cambiar del Razer a este. Es cómodo, un pelin más corto y más bajo, pero te haces a él rápido. No lo recomendaría para manos grandes. Se agradece el peso bajo y el deslizamiento es bastante cómodo.- Estética: tengo un poco de amor odio aquí. Por un lado me gusta que sea formato panal y tenga los agujeritos porque le da un toque original pero por otro pienso que es un foco de suciedad de la leche.No es que vaya con las manos sucias continuamente pero la propia grasa de la piel, el tocar cualquier cosa del setup y luego volver al ratón creo que hará que poco a poco vaya ensuciándolo por el perfil de los agujeros y que sea difícil de volver decente.Además de eso, el polvo del ambiente se irá metiendo también por los agujerillos y ensuciando el interior.Y a nivel estético/funcional no sé si me convence que los componentes estén tan expuestos dentro sin más protección que el panal.Tras un mes aún no me ha pasado nada de eso, pero me da la sensación de que tarde o temprano pasará.- Conexión/tiempos de respuesta: lo he estado usando principalmente conectado por 2.4Ghz. No he tenido sensación de retardos ni fallos de conexión ni nada así. He probado también en bluetooth para ofimática y navegar y, para eso, está bien. Para jugar en BT olvídate, usa el 2.4Ghz, ya que el bluetooth tiene algo más de retardo y, además, le cuesta más reconectar cuando lo “despiertas” del modo reposo o enciendes el pc. Me ha pasado un par de veces que se me ha desconectado mientras lo usaba en modo BT pero ha podido ser por otros factores.La configuración inicial fue muy fácil y puedes seguir usándolo mientras carga usando el mismo cable. El cable de carga es tipo C y su conexión se realiza por este mismo puerto pero en la caja viene un adaptador para que puedas conectarlo por USB A (el normal, vaya) con peso para que puedas tenerlo sobre el escritorio y no se mueva o deslice por la mesa.- Batería: en modo 2.4Ghz dura una semana exacta (lo he estado apuntando en el calendario para ser lo más precisa posible). Lo habré usado unas 4-6h al día.Se aleja mucho de lo que se anuncia porque, en realidad, donde más tiempo de batería puedes obtener es en el modo bluetooth. En este último no sabría poner tiempos porque no es lo que más he usado.La carga es bastante rápida. En una hora aprox. lo tienes totalmente cargado.Hay un modo de ahorro de energía que a mi me parece un acierto que apaga el rgb cuando deslizas el ratón y lo enciende cuando está quieto. Puedes programar, también, los minutos que pasen hasta que entra en estado de reposo.- Calidad de construcción: a pesar de que el sensor, los botones, etc. me parece que están bastante bien construidos (el sonido del click y la rueda me gustan especialmente), aquí tengo un pero muy grande.Durante la primera semana de uso, no hubo problema. En cuanto ha pasado semana y algo, ha empezado a crujir uno de los laterales (donde reposa el pulgar) con el simple hecho de apoyar el dedo y sin necesidad de apretar.Esto me trae por la calle de la amargura porque es como el típico rayoncito en tu móvil nuevo que nadie ve y eres consciente de que es algo ridículo pero ya no puedes dejar de mirar. Pues algo así. Para un ratón de este precio me parece un poco vergonzoso que pase esto.- Software: es correcto. A veces un poco engorroso pero si vas a lo sencillo no tiene mucha ciencia. Te deja configurar distintas zonas rgb así que Mila para darle un toque personal al ratón.- Resumen: ratón cómodo para manos medianas y pequeñas, batería nada del otro mundo y alejada de lo que se anuncia, carga rápida, configuración inicial sencilla, personalización correcta, estética curiosa pero con sus contras y calidad de construcción pobre para el precio que tiene.Si tuviese que comprarme otro ratón ahora supongo que no repetiría y me iría a otros similares aunque sean un pelin más caros. Si tú presupuesto es limitado y te apetece tener un ratón inalámbrico con batería en vez de pilas… no es mala opción siempre que estes dispuesto a renunciar a ciertas cosas.', 'El SteelSeries Aerox 3 Wireless Snow ha superado todas mis expectativas como ratón gaming.

Wenn Sie auf der Suche nach einer erstklassigen Gaming-Maus sind, sollten Sie die Aerox 3 definitiv in Betracht ziehen!', ""I recently purchased a mouse from SteelSeries, and overall, it has been a solid performer. This review will provide an in-depth analysis of the product, highlighting its pros and cons.Pros:  Lightweight Design: The mouse is skeletonized, making it incredibly light. This feature contributes to enhanced maneuverability and reduces fatigue during extended gaming or work sessions. The lightweight nature of the mouse allows for swift and precise movements.  Eye-catching RGB Lights: The RGB lighting on the mouse is visually appealing and adds a touch of flair to your gaming setup. The vibrant colors and effects create an immersive experience, especially in a gaming environment. However, it's worth noting that the aesthetics might not be suitable for a professional work setting.  Thumb Buttons: The mouse boasts five conveniently placed buttons for the thumb. These extra buttons can be customized to suit your needs, providing quick access to macros or other functions. The intuitive placement of these buttons enhances gaming and productivity, allowing for seamless control and efficiency.  Excellent Supporting Software: SteelSeries provides downloadable software that complements the mouse perfectly. This software allows you to customize various aspects of the mouse, including DPI settings, button mapping, and RGB lighting effects. The extensive customization options ensure that the mouse can be tailored to your specific preferences and gaming style.Cons:  Awkwardly Placed Buttons: One notable drawback is that two of the mouse buttons are situated in unconventional locations, making them awkward to use. These buttons require pressing them either upwards or downwards, which can be uncomfortable and disruptive to your grip. As a result, some users, including myself, tend to avoid using these particular buttons altogether.  Gamer Aesthetic: The mouse design clearly leans towards a gamer-centric style. While this may be a positive aspect for gaming enthusiasts, it may not appeal to individuals seeking a more subtle or professional-looking mouse. The aggressive styling and RGB lighting might not blend well with a professional work environment.  Battery Life: The battery life isn't terrible but it's also not great. It does come with a fabric usb cable to charge it and it charges very fast, but the shorter battery life can be annoying if it dies while in use.In conclusion, the SteelSeries mouse offers several impressive features that make it a desirable choice for gamers and enthusiasts. Its lightweight design, customizable thumb buttons, and captivating RGB lighting add value to the overall user experience. Additionally, the supporting software provides extensive customization options.However, it's important to note that the placement of two buttons can be awkward, leading to discomfort and the potential for limited usage. Furthermore, the gamer aesthetic may not be suitable for everyone, especially those seeking a more professional-looking mouse.If you prioritize a lightweight and customizable gaming mouse and appreciate the visual appeal of RGB lighting, this mouse is worth considering. Just be aware of the potential button placement issues and ensure that the gamer-centric design aligns with your preferences and environment."", 'Size is perfect, great fps and light mmo mouse the quality is great for the money although i wouldn’t pay the extra to get it new, it came in great shape and you could convince me easily it is band new', 'Leggero e preciso', ""Maybe it's just me, I have a different mouse that currently allows me to add weights if needed. Perhaps that has skewed my judgement on this however, the weight of this mouse is super light, the cursor (even with adjusting sensitivity to the lowest setting my my computer) is really speedy. Makes playing shooter games a little harder to play when the mouse is that sensitive. There aren't any other settings that I can see to change. I liked the idea of the holes for your palm to breath though. That is a great concept"", ""I've used this mouse little over one month now. Overall, this mouse is pretty light and decent itself for gaming. But then I am not sure if only mine does this, the left click doesn't work sometimes. I need to click it with little more power than any other mouse I've used.I was too lazy to return and get new one, then after a month, I am just used to it so doesn't bother me much . Since right click doesn't have problem, I guess only mine is defect one.Thou, I would recommend this mouse if you prefer light weight mouse.""]"

Their support ticket system is barely functional, and when it does work, they close your tickets without any response. I currently have 5 separate tickets that I've opened for the issues noted here, and ALL of them have been Closed by CoolerMaster Support with not even a reply.Pros--- Battery Life- Onboard Profiles means no crappy sofftware to installCons--- Shift+Esc is hardcoded to give you a tilde, meaning Ctrl+Shift+Esc won't pull up task manager; you can't do Shift+Esc to mark chat channels read, etc.- I have it plugged in right now to charge, but connecting it over Bluetooth. The power/charge indicator light is flickering so obscenely that it's incredibly distracting.- Using the keyboard in wired mode will remove Bluetooth connections from the board, and you'll have to re-pair it- Battery life is acceptable; however, the problem is that once the battery hits around 30%, the keyboard completely disconnects itself when you're not typing.This means that if you pause typing for more than two seconds, the ENTIRE KEYBOARD goes to sleep to preserve battery, instead of just turning off the backlighting. The keyboard becomes utterly unusable once the battery is somewhat low, as every pause in use will lead to a 2-3 second wake-up period when you start typing again.The SK622 is way more comfortable than the atrocity of ergonomic cruelty that was the SK621, touch typing is a thing again, woo!Cooler Master support is...in a bad place. They've had some struggles this past year with internal issues and COVID. All the best to em, but a a consumer, you're gonna get the shaft if you need any support from them.The multiple bluetooth profiles make it nice for swapping on the fly, but honestly there are so many annoying little quirks with this keyboard that I suggest you either look in a lower price range for something that works more functionally, or if you're otherwise looking for a good, multi profile, wireless mechanical keyboard, keep hunting.

Read all the reviews of all the latest and greatest out there. I was not going to spend over 50.00 so that cut down my options a bit. I had decided on one with a track ball. After reading the only two reviews at Amazon about the Periboard 706 Plus and being in my price range I decided to give it a try. I took the free shipping option and it arrived in only two days! Super easy setup. It was much larger than a mini but I knew that before I purchased it. The keyboard is fantastic although I do not not use it a great deal. I actually got it for the track ball. I have to say that the track ball layout is somewhat restrictive and takes some getting used to. After a week or so it became natural to me. The track ball is very responsive and accurate. The looks are great. The range is good. All in all a Good Deal. If you are looking for a one handed remote, this is not an option.

This transferred many of the functions of my remote controls to that of a mouse and keyboard. The big problem was finding the right keyboard to use while lounging and being able to watch media and surf at the same time. I used a USB mini keyboard for a while, but after upgrading to Win7 I had to get serious about finding a wireless interface for the system. After a lot of searching, I stumbled on the Periboard 706PLUS. This looked like a great solution and I was not disappointed.This keyboard is easy to handle when I am reclining or have a cat sitting on my lap. The keys are large and easy to read. This is important because I am often trying to type with one hand.I use a mouse on the side table so the track ball isn\'t important to me, but it works nicely it you prefer that. The RF link is flawless even from across the room. The keyboard is light yet stiff and is a good value. The USB transceiver is very small and can be  stored inside the battery compartment when not in use. The unit is powered by 2 ""AAA"" cells.Altogether the product is an excellent reflection of German design principles - basic lines, practical with excellent performance yet, unlike traditional products, it is very affordable. Perixx products may be a little hard to find, but I am happy I looked long enough to find what I wanted and I am extremely pleased with my purchase.', ""There's no reason this shouldn't be Bluetooth so it doesn't require a USB port and also be usable with Android devices.  Pretty much *everything* has built in Bluetooth.  Use of external USB nanoreceivers is obsolete technology.The keyboard and trackball itself work well for me.  However, how do you clean the trackball?  I've been in IT professionally since 1989 until I was forced into retirement due to disability in 2013.  Mice and trackballs get a lint build up on the rollers and LED sensor.  The ball needs to be removed and cleaned regularly.  We'll see how long this thing lasts."", ""This key board is quite good. I have another one from iogear that went bad. One of the lines in the keyboard is faulty and could not repair it.

Its only the mouse functionality that is a bit challenging, but its amazing how quickly your brain retrains your fingers to use the new keyboard.in the old keyboard the click & right click and the scroll were on the left side with the trackball on the right, so you always had to use 2 hands to use the keyboard. however in this one you can use 3 fingers on your right hand to operate the mouse. the index finger for the click , middle finger for the mouse movement. after just one day of usage  i have completely adapted to this new keyboard.

The pen is not able to reach the side of the screen to calibrate properly', 'Dual boot machine with Win 10 / Linux Mint 19.1. I was kind of nervous because it looked like Linux support was new. I hooked it up, turned it on, and it started working with no problems!! It got added as a 4th monitor, and took pen input to it and my other 3 monitors. Then I got the driver software. It allowed me to limit the pen input to just one screen (any of my 3 monitors or the tablet). This was useful otherwise the pen input could go all over the place.If I set to the tablet, I could open Blender and move it on to the tablet (it thinks of it as \'just another monitor\'), and draw directly on the tablet in Blender. I think this is the main way intended to use it. But 2 of my monitors are 4K. So I opened Blender on second monitor, used driver to point pen input to that monitor, and worked great. I was worried at first because one of their instructions said ""set the monitor and tablet to the same resolution"" and would reduce my 4K to its 1920x1080 resolution, but that was not necessary.Set up on Windows was just as easy.What I don\'t like is the driver software sets itself to start on Start Up. Not good to have popups when starting machine. Also on Linux the feature to apply differently to different applications does not work. But maybe in a later release. I saw it on Windows.What I like about the driver software is you can change from using the whole tablet as input to a smaller section. So you can make a small section and pen moves a lot faster.I\'m not an artist and mostly intend to use it for simple art work. I tried Blender sculpting with the mouse and got wrist pain in an hour. I also just hate clicking and found with Muse4 (music writing software) its easier to pen-click than mouse click. I\'ve heard these tablets help prevent wrist pain. It will take some getting used to, but it works so well and so well integrated with keyboard / mouse / monitors that I\'m really excited. Since I use the tablet but look at my larger 4K monitor, in hindsight I should have got a tablet without a display. I got the display because one thing I didn\'t know is that it shows you the pen position if you hold it like 1 - 2 inches away, I was worried I wouldn\'t be able to figure out where the pen would go down on screen but that\'s not a problem. It works fine out of the box with their defaults, but there a lot of configuration options and it will take some time and practice getting used to it, and adjusting the settings to find what I like best.Wow, that was a long first impression -- but I haven\'t been this impressed by a peripheral in a long time !!UPDATE: Just found that software allows ""Mouse Mode"". With it off, cursor position matches exactly with pen representation. I read artists get used to this by moving their whole forearm. But with ""Mouse Mode"" on, it moves the cursor relative to last down position -- more like a scratch pad where it moves the mouse when your finger is down. The tablet is a little different -- it will track the pen slightly over the screen, so I have to left the pen higher. I like mouse mode better, jsut a preference that I don\'t want to move my hand over a large area; just move the pen by fingers and can keep my hand mostly in the same place (with a slight raise for \'finger up\' to not move the cursor).', ""The screen has more texture than a glass surface, and the stylus has tilt-sensitivity.  All of the buttons are customizable, though the wheel control could use something to keep your finger from slipping on it because it's completely smooth-surfaced (minor gripe). I love this tablet."", 'Buen producto de acuerdo a la calidad-precio', ""I ordered this creative pen display for my daughter. Cintiq was just too expensive and XP-Pen seemed to offer very similar for a much cheaper price. It's been over 18 months now and we has no regrets. I have even recommended it to a friend who decided to go with the large version."", 'Very happy', 'This is the first drawing tablet I have used. I struggle with using illustrator on my laptop. Mastering control of the tools has been tiresome and it was suggested I might get on better with a drawing tablet. It was at the top of my budget for a new piece of untested equipment £249, before £30 discount offer (thankyou - very nice), so £219. After a bit if research, I worked out I definitely would be more accurate faster with a tablet that duplicated my program image rather than a blank tablet, which would certainly require more hand I co-oordination than I have patience for, especially on detailed work. Best decision made in my book. I have only tried out for a few hours but so far very impressed. I am sure higher budgeted models and brands must be amazing, but this seems to be all I need for my illustration work at this time. Very simple to set up. I have a old laptop with MS windows 7, and use old Adobe Illustrator CS program. I was concerned initially that a new gadget probably would not be compatible, but as this xp-pen said okay for 7,8,9,10 versions, I thought it would be worth trying. It worked instantly without downloading additional drivers, but I did download a newer version off their website when I could not locate the pen tablet setting box to configure my preset buttons. Once downloaded newer version all appeared as it should. Still learning control but all is very comfortable. The screen 11"" size was another factor I am glad I went for. If I could afford to go bigger I would, but this for me is the minimum workable size. Eying off the 24"" when upgrade time comes. Screen colour is good. The pen is very nice. I read about people saying had to be careful with and I would not want to drop it for fear of damage. Replacements are@ £25, so annoying but not the end of the world. It comes with a stand, which I find the texture of quite rough. I think it could be abrasive on the tablet back if you keep putting on and off in due course. I use a fold away adjustable one from amazon I actually bought for laptop, and sit laptop in the xp-pen one. I can then adjust my working angle to suit. I have ordered screen protectors as I think the screen contact with pen will eventually leave marks, just from repeated actions. Currently left the initial packaging protector on while I practice. This model must be connected to laptop to operate. Some makes and models are compatible with Android (not this one), so if being mobile is important, you would require a different tablet. As my illustrator only works on this laptop, being portable was not a consideration for me. The only peeve I have discovered in this short time is the 3 to 1 hmdi/usb leads. You need all to be engaged or functionality is effected - IE pen does not work black usb is disconnected, so it has used up all my portals - hence the 4 star rating. Not a big deal, but a little annoying for me as I can\'t use my mouse on laptop. Probably not a issue on a newer laptop. Mine is 8+ years old. Aside from that, for price point it appears to deliver everything I need it to for my digital artwork.

I bought this drawing pad for productivity: lectures, drawing diagrams, and collaborating remotely. my son said his university classes were combining pads, jamboard, and zoom... i read a bit, and it seemed like a great idea for me at a tech company. so, here i am. i was going to buy the pad he bought (Huion 13""), but there were lots of reviews that it might not work, or was a pain, with Mac, so I went with XP. LoL. it\'s just as much a pain, and probably identical setup. so, i\'m not sure which of the two is better.  Once you get it working, it is good and serving my purposes... though there are a lot of \'every time\' gotchas too.The instructions for these devices are truly terrible. i\'ve installed on MacOS 10.14, 10.15, and Ubunutu 18.0.4. Ubuntu was the easiest, and when Linux is the easiest, something has gone wrong. Hopefully this will help someone else. I am working on Macbook Pros (2014-2015 editions). So, this is for that setup...* you absolutely have to buy a connector or two: you will need a USB C -> HDMI converter. i got mine for $8 on Amazon; they were $30 at home depot.  the new macbooks only have usb C... so yeah... must buy this.. yes, i know some videos online say they are included in the product. they aren\'t.* you\'ll also need a usb -> usb c connector to convert older usb to the mac usb c.  if you have a modern macbook, you probably already have these, since nothing works w/o them.* ignore the instructions that tell you to plug in all three cables, you don\'t need that; you plug the hdmi and the black cord in, that\'s it.* you do need to download and install their driver from the XP website.  mostly you can follow that...* you do need to make sure to uninstall any previous drawing pads and the drivers (more on this later)* in the mac accessibility, you might not see the XP UX that is described in the manual... I did not, and it worked fine until reboot (more later)...* allow the accessibility,* set the display to mirror (i have tried and failed several times to get anywhere w/o mirror display),* you must have the Pen Utility App for it to work as a drawing tool,* the most frustrating thing might be that the pen moves the mouse, but doesn\'t respond to to it... if this happens, something is set up wrong... check the accessibility again, make sure there is *no* wacom driver in there at all... make sure the utility app is running...* you probably need to recalibrate it.. and sometimes the button doesn\'t respond to recalibrate several times...with all this, it should work... try in a drawing tool, google draw, or zoom... but when it reboots, if you are stuck with it not responding to the pen.. check the accessibility settings again... even though i\'d removed the wacom app, the drivers were still there... you have to hunt down the wacom drivers and delete them...left handed? me too. so, you *can* get the display to rotate by using the mac display setting. it does work, but you\'ll have to recalibrate it every single time you use the pad. you can probably save and reload the configs, but it won\'t remember them w/o intervention... the mac remembers (so the pad is rotated), but xp doesn\'t, so the mouse is backwards.  i gave up and just left it right handed.a couple other things i found:* google draw kinda sucks with it, but it does work.  if you want to do writing to text, install the google inputs extension... but then you also have to go into your drawing and set the language to ""english"" (or whatever yours is). yes, it won\'t work if you don\'t do that.  once installed, google inputs handwriting recognition is excellent.* zoom works with mac Ink (OS 10.14), but again is a bit of a pain,* jamboard has better readability / sensitivity than google drawAssuming you get through all this, it is actually very useful - though all the cords suck -- and it is a nice display to have when in meetings... i am using it, and i\'m glad i have something... is it better than the others? no idea.', 'J’ai longuement chercher et réfléchis avant de la trouver à un prix correcte et également avant de l’acheter.Alors pour commencer la livraison était dans les temps, mais en revanche le cartons d’amazon était arracher sur l’un des angles mais heureusement ce qui servait de protection à l’intérieur à bien fait son job. La boîte de la tablette n’avait rien à par que les petits morceau de scotch qui servait à tenir la boiter fermer était malheureusement ouvert donc rien ne manque mais ça serait beaucoup mieux si à l’avenir la boîte serait fermer.Quand j’ai ouvert tout était à ça place et en très bonne état à par qu’avec la boîte on remarque que c’est de l’occasion à cause des traces noir mais ce n’est que sur la boîte donc ça importe peut.Maintenant passons à la tablette et le driver ainsi que les câbles. Le driver c’était pas aussi compliqué que certains peuvent prétendre, suffis d’aller sur le site « XP-PEN » et de chercher le nom de la tablette c’est à dire « Artist 12 Pro » et il vous propose plusieurs driver mais faut ce fier au date et hop vous télécharger le driver le plus récent et c’est régler, bon après faut avoir un Windows 10, pas un Windows trop vieux non plu.Les mac j’en sais rien, j’en possède pas.Les câbles.. bon il marche tous parfaitement mais c’est pas pratique du tout, il y a plein de câble brancher à mon pc surtout que de base c’est un pc gamer donc j’ai aussi un truc qui fait de l’air froid pour éviter la surchauffe ( je sais plu le nom bref ) donc il me restait plus que 3 port usb mais sinon malgré ça, ça roule comme sur des roulettes.Je n’ai aucun câble qui bug ou qui et arracher.Sinon il y a un câble qui rajoute de la longueur au câble usb si il sont trop court, ça j’en suis bien contente de l’avoir.La tablette, aucun bug au démarrage.J’ai réussi en même pas 5 min à la régler en fonction de mon pc etc.., elle et en très bonne état pour un produit d’occasion.Bon.. ça fait que deux jour que je l’ai et que je l’utilise, mais j’en suis pas déçu, après j’utilise « Clip Studio Paint » j’ai plus de préférence.Elle n’est pas compliqué, je me suis immédiatement habituer et je préfère dessiner avec une tablette comme ça qu’une tablette sans écran. Après reste avoir si elle va durer dans le temps, d’ailleurs le stylet je n’ai aucun soucis avec également.Donc pour l’instant je n’ai aucun soucis avec ma commande mise à par que le cartons d’Amazon avais un angle arracher et que le cartons de la tablette était ouvert, mais rien ne manque à ma commande mais bon vaut mieux y éviter à l’avenir.Voilà, c’était tout.']"

Also, I for one do  not like the long key boards, they take to much space. You can do everything on this one but there's a small learning curve to figure it out."", 'While the keyboard was too big for my handspan, the customer service to return this item was quick and efficient.', 'Was looking for the perfect USB keyboard for my ""theC64 mini.""  The mini suffers from lack of USB ports and using a keyboard means taking one of the two.  This keyboard takes 1 and gives back two!  That\'s a net gain in USB ports.  But not just that, but it grants USB ports which are close at hand!  And frankly the theC64 mini doesn\'t have a functional keyboard and aside from powering on or off, there are few reasons to even have the thing accessible.So as the ""best keyboard for theC64 mini in the world!"" (at the moment) how could it be better?  Well, C64 keyboard printing (which I happen to know Perixx is engaged in this work!) and perhaps Commodore-like (Commodore-ish?  Commodorable!  Yes!  Commodorable!) colors would be awesome.Why is this keyboard better than less expensive USB mini keyboards?  For one, it contains the COMPLETE keyboard key set all in the right locations.  The theC64 mini makes use of the F12 key to perform reset functions within the emulator.  Can\'t comfortably do that when most mini keyboards cram the F11 and F12 keys within the F1 and F2 keys like most.  (consider the keyboard combination of fn-F2-`-[tab]-shift or the like.  It\'s absurd.  This keyboard respects that F11 and F12 should be directly accessible for whatever purpose they may be assigned.  And if you\'re a Windows user you know they are for doing things like full screen which is important for some.Keyboards are very personal items.  No one board fits the needs and comfort for all in every situation.  Can\'t be done.  So the challenge for keyboard makers is very obvious.  Variety!  It\'s probably one of the most obvious challenges for a product maker.  It\'s way more expensive to do than having a smaller product line.  So my respect and appreciation for that as well.Request summary: (1) USB3 for both hub ports and plug (2) C64 keycaps option (3) C64 colors option (4) self-contained macro keys (not driven by software but programmable by software)  Probably too much to ask but ""want is want"" but this definitely has what I need now!', 'This keyboard is your ride or die. I spent $400 on a reproduction of the original IBM model F keyboard in April. They’re all made to order and handmade so I probably won’t receive it for 1-2 years. Point is, this isn’t a fancy mechanical keyboard. If that’s what you’re looking for them skip this. But if you want something compact that’s affordable and works well for what it is then look no further.I’m 5’5” and have narrow shoulders. Shorter and smaller people will know the struggle of most office furniture and accessories being made for 6’2” men. So you run into ergonomic issues.This is the perfect length keyboard for ergonomic purposes. You run into not having the 10-key which is what allows it to be shorter. A full sized or even 75% keyboard with 10-key will cause shoulder strain from using the mouse on the right side. You have to stretch your arm and it’s uncomfortable. This eliminates that if you use your mouse on the right side.At my desk I use a full size keyboard because I do a lot of data entry. I taught myself to learn the mouse left handed so now I can put the mouse on the left and still have the 10-key eliminating shoulder strain.When I want to work elsewhere I used this keyboard and set it on my laptop lap pad and use the mouse and this keyboard on it with my laptop plugged into a tv monitor. Works perfectly. This is great for travel in that way. It has two USB ports so you can connect a mouse and even a separate 10-key to it if you want it. Works great. No complaints. Best out there for the price. I like the layout and that certain keys aren’t eliminated for space which can be a pain on compact keyboards. For example I like having separate function keys at the top. This one is a winner.', 'A few things to note:The layout is American. This is not a huge issue, simply that you need to remember that a couple of the keys are not as marked. If set up for the UK it is thus:3/# is actually 3/£| and \\ is actually #/~ BUT can become the others by use of alt gr/alt gr + shift4/$ can also make € by using alt gr2/@ is actually 2/""""/\' is actually @/\'As expected for the price, the keyboard feels cheap and I\'m not sure how long it will last. It will lack functionality that more expensive laptops have, so don\'t expect it to do much more than let you type. It\'s also quite noisy, but I\'ve found that to be true for most keyboard. Especially for raised keys.Because it is compact (which I needed) it doesn\'t take up as much space as your usual keyboard would. Perfect for those with small desks/anyone that doesn\'t need the extra keypad. Keys are slightly odd (in my opinion), and I keep mistyping shift/enter/arrow keys. The keys were small on my old keyboard too, but I rarely mistyped.Set up is simple, just plug and play. It doesn\'t come with a manual, but if you want or need one then the box suggests you can download one. That shouldn\'t be necessary.There are two ports at the back. Not sure what I\'d personally use them for, but others may find them useful.""Tilt"" is built in, so if you like your keyboard flat, there\'s no option for that.Keys aren\'t flat, which may be an issue for some people. I find it much easier to type of flat keys than not, but you get what you pay for.', 'Nice And small. Shoulder injury makes moving my arm painful. This and a small numeric pad work like a charm.', 'Perfectly competent; I just wish it had more than 2 usb ports built in.', ""Très bien exactement ce que je voulaisEt pourtant j'ai pris ce clavier anglais uk en désespoir de cause ne trouvant pas le clavier qwerty us international , hors malgré sa désignation dans la description c'est bien un clavier qwerty us international car sur raspberry pi os dans la configuration il correspond à :generic 101 key PCEnglish (US)English (US , intl , with dead key)et là toutes les touches fonctionnent , même les accents sur certaines voyelles aussi bien graves que aiguschoses impossible avec le qwerty pure et il devient possible d'écrire dans plusieurs langue sans modifier le clavier tout en ayant toutes les subtilités de la langue utilisée"", 'I got this keyboard to upgrade a few other smaller ones I have been using, mainly for better USB performance and because the old keyboard letter print was wearing off. Overall, for the price, I\'m happy.Pros:-nice rubber feet keep keyboard from sliding too much-quiet keys - stop too much ""click sound""-letter printed off center on keys: hopefully helps with letter where-off in the long haul-Has a windows menu activation key (Alt+Gr) which is kind of handy if you are key-centric person.Cons:-biggest con was the ctrl-windows-alt-fn keys are skewed a little to the left so I need to get used to copy/paste keys in a different way.-doesn¡¦t have back-elevating feet, so keyboard doesn\'t slant up very much (might be a pro for you!)- Cable and USB ports are on the top/front of keyboard. If you have a narrow desk with a monitor stand close to keyboard, you will have a bit of trouble using USB ports.- I couldn\'t find a numlock off key sequence so if bios enables numlock, that might be a problem to turn off. There might be a way to numlock off with keyboard, but I couldn\'t easily find it. I don\'t like numlock on so not a big deal for me. if you cannot disable numlock in your BIOS (which is unlikely), you might want to get the manual on this keyboard before buying it. :)overall, no cons are deal breakers, and the price is right, so this is a pretty nice keyboard.']"

It got killed by a single drip of coffee.  There\'s no way to clean it, so it\'s garbage. It\'s a shame, too, because I really liked typing on this one.=====For many years the ""gold standard"" for typing was the IBM Selectric keyboard. Whoever designed that keyboard deserves a medal. Since then there has been just about every attempt you can imagine to create something equivalent.This keyboard gets close.The Good...I\'m not fond of wasting desktop space.  This keyboard is about 3/4 the width and the same depth as a regular ""slimline"" keyboard so the table top saving is pretty obvious. The frame is compact too, with no unused area or needless palm rests or fancy curved edges.The key spacing is ""full size"" so adapting from other keyboards to this one takes only a few seconds.  Almost from the beginning, I have been typing on this keyboard without looking at it.The typing feel is much like a high quality laptop keyboard in that the keys start off just a tiny bit stiff then as you increase pressure they collapse easily making sure that characters are reliably registered as you type.The chicklet style keytops are a good size. Any smaller and I would be getting corner hits, any bigger and there wold be no sense of the space between them so mistyping could be a problem. I haven\'t tried my typing tests with this board but so far it is fairly obvious I am making fewer mistakes with it than with the older board it\'s replacing.I\'m also not fond of unnecessary hand or arm motion while typing. It slows me down considerably and it can result in repetitive motion problems. This keyboard effectively minimizes that by eliminating the largely vacant space between the main keyboard and calculator pad. They did the right thing and tossed all those middle keys out, since they\'re duplicates anyway, and moved the number pad to the left. The result is a keyboard that doesn\'t require a long move to type in some numbers. For right handed people this can also position your mouse closer to your typing position, making that easier too.Of course the calculator pad has the usual Num-Lock function which when off converts it into a cursor management pad. It takes only 1 extra keystroke to flip back and forth.  In fact, coming from typewriter days I usually have the Num-Lock off, and use the numbers on the top typewriter row instead. This gives me very convenient access to the cursor functions.They obviously put some thought into the housing as well. Many keyboards have a frame section in front of the space bar that gets right in the way, causing me to typelikethis  for no good reason at all. This keyboard has a rolled away frame that I\'ve yet to hit while typing.The FN+ charms are all laid out nicely along the function key row and to their credit, no so dull that you can\'t see them in a less than brightly lit room. You can even flip the function keys over to their charms full time by pressing FN+ESC so you can treat them as single keys rather than needing the FN shift key.  The little lock light on the top right will glow when you do. To set them back to normal function key operation just hit FN+ESC again.The (not so) Bad...They\'re still duplicating keys for no good reason.  The right side calculator pad has all the cursor and page functions on it, there is no need to duplicate them under the right shift key.  I would rather they move the Alt and Ctrl keys over a bit and give me a bigger space bar.Although it\'s not much of an issue, the keytops end up level with the top of the keyboard\'s deck when pressed. If you have long fingernails you are likely to end up repeatedly hitting the deck as you type.On the right side of the calculator pad they replaced the large + key with a Backspace and a smaller + key. This is very non-standard and I look forward to making that mistake a whole bunch of times until I get used to it.Like many keyboards these days there is a DEL key right above the larger Backspace key. For typing this isn\'t a serious thing but when navigating Windows Explorer with the keyboard hitting DEL instead of Backspace is the difference between moving back one folder and serious problems with data loss.  There is a DEL key on the calculator pad... no need to duplicate it and especially not in a potentially dangerous position.Sooooo...Overall I like this keyboard. It\'s great to type on, requiring only minimal adjustment.  It is a well thought out design and the issues I pointed out can all be very easily avoided with just a bit of caution.Not recommended because of the moisture problem....', 'I love that this fits on my shorter keyboard tray with my mouse. My only concern is that the page up/down / home buttons are now 2 buttons and require my left hand hitting the Function button.  I found I use these keys a lot and it’s a bit annoying. Would be nice if that extra button was not needed or more accessible.', ""My HP Leap Motion keyboard broke after using it for 6 years, so I'm really used to having a low-profile compact keyboard for both office and gaming. A month ago I decided to try PERIBOARD-317R because it looked quite flat... but yeah ignored the actual product dimensions, the keyboard was too high and my left wrist got painful (and I'm not a wrist pad user). I don't know why I didn't see PERIBOARD-213U at that time, but right after my wrist started getting painful I looked up for another keyboard, and hey! another keyboard from the same brand, and looked almost exactly like my old HP keyboard! Even the dimensions are quite similar! I don't mind that is refurbished or not mechanical or whatever, no more wrist pain for me :D-Compared to HP, the keys are a little bit taller and harder to press down, while HP feels more like touching than pressing-its also noisier, but I live by myself so noise doesn't really matter-have to get used to the new layout, function keys like home, page up/down, screenshot are on some weird places, and have to use powertoys to change key inputs so that I don't need to press Fn+up/down to flip pages when I'm using a Chinese input tool...Overall this is a perfect keyboard for me, I guess I'll keep 317R as a backup instead of returning it."", 'As a person with long nails this is the only key board that works for me! I am really happy with it and use it daily!', 'I needed a cheap, white quiet keyboard for my computer and this is perfect! Compact but still has the number keys on the side and isn’t loud at all! Great for the price', ""This is a great little keyboard. Just plugs into your computer with a USB and it works right away. This is a low profile style with short keys, perfect for a lot of typing. The keys feel smooth but not slippery. It's not the quietest keyboard I've ever had but it's not the loudest either. All the functions work well. I like the basic style and am happy that they make this in white as it's easier to see the buttons for me. Good basic keyboard."", ""I'd seen some YouTube videos where you could plug in a USB-C keyboard into a Kindle Scribe or a Remarkable 2. I bought the keyboard specifically for that purpose. Sad to say that it did not work for either. It worked as you would expect plugged into a PC - so I can't fault the keyboard. The feel and the response for touch typists is excellent and the keyboard is well suited for situations where USB-C is required and the devices supports a keyboard attachment."", ""Bought this because of the price. I didn't want to spend alot of money. I love this keyboard. Its a great size. Was worried it was going to be a cheap keyboard. It's perfect and cute, it fits the length of my computer stand. Very happy I tried it. If your looking for an inexpensive keyboard this is it..Great product for the money and its perfect."", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0I wasn’t sure if this keyboard would help me with my shoulder pain, but it did! I used to have to reach far for my mouse due to the width of regular keyboards. I had to move my keyboard slightly left to be able to reach my mouse but I wasn’t comfortable typing either with my keyboard not centered in front of me. This keyboard allows me to use my mouse without extending my arm. I also like that I can have my keyboard centered in front of me. The number pad with the additional delete key is very useful. I am so glad I bought it honestly!!! I had it for a year now and I am still in love !', 'Light, perfect for WFH white set ups, hasn’t given me a problem']"

Wer Augen im Kopf hat, kann es auf den Fotos sehen.Die Tastatur ist NICHT in DE-Layout erhältlich.', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0This gaming keyboard is not only great to game on but is also a pleasure to type on. I was looking for a new keyboard for my gaming setup and it had to have nice switches in it and this keyboard is a perfect fit. It has mechanical keys that are very high quality. The keys have a have actuation point so it lets me type and more importantly put inputs in faster when I am gaming. I also love how the keyboard is backlit with a wide array of RGB LEDs. They help me see my keys when I am gaming in the dark and they also make my setup look really cool with the lighting effects. I also love the compact design of this keyboard and it allows me to place it anywhere on my desk to make sure I have the maximum level of comfort while gaming. The installation of the keyboard was seamless. All I had to do was plug the keyboard into a USB and it worked right away. The keyboard comes with many customizable features by using the FN keys and following the manual. Almost every key on the keyboard has an alternate macro function making it extremely efficient for its size.', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Summary: I’d get this keyboard for the interesting keycaps and fun RGBs. Fun gift idea for someone reminiscent of typewriters.The first time I saw the keyboard, I was instantly reminded of typewriters. Its really a cool retro look. The keycaps were definitely what sold me on the product. At first glance, the product is really light. I like how sturdy the braided cable is and how long it is.Taking off the keycap, the switch is indeed a “blue clicky switch” (Bsun brand, which is a decent outemu equivalent at 60gf and 4mm travel). Very impressed that it is still a branded rather than in-house switch. The switches are also compatible with custom keycaps, so feel free to buy some other caps to swap on if you get tired of the typewriter caps! I personally like that the keycap\x10is a thinner plastic. I have some PBT caps that I swapped on, and the stock keycaps really retain the typewriter ‘click’ that my PBT caps mellow out. I would say that this keyboard should be for someone who enjoys the typing experience because it will be loud and click-y. If you are used to membrane keyboards then this will be something you have to get used to. Its a fun novelty gift for sure.I am someone who uses 60% keyboards, so I don’t find the function keys or the arrows particularly useful. The lighting modes are definitely very cool and I like how the right hand dial allows you to adjust media (play, pause, skip, and volume control). Great and sleek way to hide media controls.Pros* Truly a mechanical keyboard, with decent switches* Fun retro keycaps and supports swapping keycaps* 18 RGB colour modes, very bright and seen in daylight* Lots of RGB customization options WITHOUT the need of 3rd party software, no extra installation required and clear instructions on how to swap to game modes or record your own CUSTOM backlight (very nice, haven’t seen in a lot of budget boards)* Media keys is a really unique feature you won’t find on a lot of boardsCons* USB-A plug, so may require adaptor if you use a MacBook', ""I've had this keyboard for over a year now and I love it. It's beautiful to look at and definitely an eye-catcher. Far more unique than most keyboards you come across. The keys feel good to type; they are a little loud but I prefer this over switches that are silent. It legit feels like typing on a typewriter. It is also easy to clean between the keys with an air blower; the keys are so tall it's hard for anything to get permanently stuck between them or under them. Controls for switching between lights and lighting modes are a little difficult to remember but that might just be my brain being dumb. There are PLENTY of colors and effects to choose from. One tiny negative is that the metal rings sometimes fall off on about 5 of the keys, but that will likely be easily solved with a tiny dot of glue. Not enough for me to take a star off. Also, this thing is built like a tank. It's heavy, solidly built and doesn't feel like the cheap plastic crap they sell these days. On top of that, I spilled a cup of water on it recently and was certain I'd doomed it. After leaving it propped up with a fan on it for 3 days, though, it's working perfectly again!"", ""I was super excited to get this keyboard and initially, I loved it.After a 6 hour grind session on BDO, however, the side of my thumb was bruised and horrible sore from how it rested upon the corner of the space key. This could very well be due to the fact that I'm not used to the type of material the keys were made from (it was my first mechanical keyboard too) and the fact that I was too stubborn in my farming to take a break which is completely on me. Still, the keys were satisfying to use and the lights were lovely.The light settings proved to be this keyboard's downfall for me though. It could be that I just got a faulty one but the settings for mine in regards to color changing and glow pattern just sorta broke. Granted, it could also be user error on my part but I couldn't get the color cycles to work- or stay- and the patterns just stopped working altogether. I got so frustrated trying to troubleshoot and look up tutorials on how to get the keyboard's light system to work properly that I just ended up sending it back despite how much I loved the aesthetic. Perhaps other people will have better luck with it!"", ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0I'm not a hard-core gamer, although I do spend several hours a week online with MMOs or Battle Royale-style games. As keyboards go, this has been robust enough to keep up with my gameplay, having great response and accuracy. I'd recommend it for that alone.The main reason I purchased the keyboard is because 1) I love the look and feel of old-style keyboards and 2) I do a great deal of my writing after dark, and needed a backlit keyboard as I prefer to limit my light sources when working that late. By that litmus, I absolutely love the STOGA Mechanical Keyboard. They keys have adjustable brightness, there are many different settings for light patterns to play across the keys (or none, if you want to be dull), and key keys have a satisfying 'tic tac' sound as you type.The keys themselves are solid and the board is a satisfying weight that sits secure on my writing desk - it doesn't feel or look cheap.If I had to complain - the covers for the knobs which control the lighting and volume were a little loose in their settings - which I solved with a spot of glue - and the keyboard sits flat, with no angle adjustment option (I prefer it tilted up when writing).That said: for the price, the overall quality of the build, and the experience using it, I've recommended this board to a friend who needed a keyboard for similar reason as mine - and I further recommend it here."", ""Pros:Sounds like a typewriter, which is fun while writing essaysLots of cool light modes (some interactive) and adjustable brightnessMany buttons to change volume, pause music or open apps which is super convenientCons:Sounds like a typewriter, which is less cool when you're gaming on voice chat with friendsHard to clean but easy to see the dirt and debris in the keyboardBIGGEST CON: Plastic silver rings easily break and fall off the keys with regular use, making the keys small and harder to use [pciture attached]If I hadn't broken the space bar (my fault not the keyboard's) I probably would've been fine using this for a few more years, but I don't think ill buy it again.If you want a quieter keyboard or something more long-lasting (especially if you have a decent budget) I'd encourage you to look elsewhere. If not though, this one is okay.""]"

For the most part, it gets almost every specific detail right. The ""Scroll Lock"" and ""Pause"" button are off-center vertically, which is a bit annoying, but not that big deal. The trademarked Windows logo is not specific for that era (check the reference picture for comparison) and that\'s a real shame. I would have preferred the classic look or a generic ""Start"" or ""Menu"" button instead, because I mainly use this on Linux and retro machines.What I don\'t like about the design is that the font color is not dark enough. If you can\'t see colors that well, then the contrast between the black text and the gray buttons is a bit lacking. I guess this is fine enough for most people, though.Construction wise this keyboard feels hefty if you are comparing it to modern keyboards. If you are comparing it, instead, with classic retro keyboards then it just feels like cheap plastic. The description says this is inspired by the IBM Model M keyboard, which can be misleading in a couple of ways. Those 80\'s keyboards used to weigh way over 2kg, so by comparison this keyboard seems flimsy. Even comparing it with the late 90\'s Chinese one from the comparison picture this keyboards still feels on the budget.The buttons are OK to the touch. They feel soft but somehow porous. I don\'t know if this would make them hard to clean, but we\'ll see. By comparison, classic keyboards used to have heavy, flat and shiny buttons. Button travel is OK and noise level is a bit lower than older keyboards. They aren\'t mechanical (which can be a bit confusing because it was inspired by a mechanical keyboard). The ""Space"" button works really well when pressed on it\'s extremities (this was a problem with DOS games as control schemes often required you to hit the shorter end with your left hand). Just don\'t expect those 20 keys combos, this is a modern USB keyboard after all.The cable is long enough. The back lets you select what side the cable comes out from (left of right; no middle option). Although I don\'t see this essential, the back of the keyboard is missing drainage holes (these are used if you accidentally spill drinks on it). They used to be common on old-school keyboards.As briefly mentioned, quality control could be improved. It may have been designed in Germany, but the end-product was made in China. My keyboard wobbles a bit diagonally even on a flat surface, regardless if I raise it or keep it flat. I use a bit of paper to keep it at level. I consider this keyboard to be a bit pricey for what it is, so I wasn\'t expecting these kind of problems.Overall this is a good modern keyboard. I am enjoying it. It looks and feels great, but I cannot shake the feeling that it was designed based solely on pictures and not an actual physical reference.', 'I am so glad that I bought this keyboard . I have been using computers since the 80s and everyone was use to a good heavy duty keyboard with those clock keys . What we all called the IBM keyboard . All the new keyboards are now so slim and just cheap feeling . When I type I hate the keys . I am so glad that I decided to look for one and if you like that type of keyboard this is for don’t second guess go for it !!!', ""I grew up in the golden age of computing.  I learned to type on an IBM Model M and still use a Unicomp Model M.  My favorite keyboard from the 90s was probably a Packard Bell that had BTC dome with sliders.  For a long while, my daily was an Apple Magic Keyboard, but I wanted more tactility, like the Model M, but quiet to avoid waking the family at night.  This led me to a Keychron with Gateron browns.  I love all of these keyboards.  They each have their own unique characteristics that make them a joy to type on.When I started developing carpal tunnel syndrome because the work-issued HP/Dell membrane keyboard gave so little feedback that it would force me to type with more heavy-handedness to ensure that keys would register, I went looking for an affordable keyboard that would give better tactility and have no problems replacing if it were stolen from my office.  It had to also be relatively quiet given the office environment.  This led me to the Perixx Periboard 106, which I learned about from keyboard enthusiasts on YouTube.The Periboard has a very nostalgic design.  It looks and feels the Keytronic keyboards from the late 90s.  While I used a Keytronic back then, I was not a fan at the time, as I was into more clicky keyboards.  It was however very quiet.  This Periboard does feel more tactile than I recall the Keytronic being.  In fact, it has more tactility than the Gateron browns on my Keychron.  The Gateron browns feel linear to me, likely because I am used to high actuation force keyboards like the Model M.  That said, the Periboard does require higher actuation force than the Gateron browns.In testing my typing speed on the Periboard, I am able to achieve 98wpm at 98% accuracy, comparable to the Keychron w/Gateron browns.  This is up from my 87wpm when typing on the Unicomp Model M.  What this tells me is that the Periboard's actuation force, while higher, is not so high that it slows me down, but gives me more tactility.  And in using the Periboard for a month now at work, I find it has indeed relieved my wrist pain.I can highly recommend this keyboard and I would easily buy it again if I ever lost mine.  It is the least expensive keyboard I own, but does not feel cheaply made, has an excellent balance between tactility and actuation force requirements, has a very pleasant typing sound / sound signature, and also has wonderful nostalgic value for people who grew up during the earlier days of computing--before the Internet became widespread.Update 7/1/2023:I came to like my white PERIBOARD so much, that I was sure that this keyboard would be my end-game keyboard.  I decided to buy another one for home, to replace my Keychron (which is still too light for my taste).  This time I bought a black one.  The black one I received is a disappointment.  The actuation force requirements for the black keyboard is much higher than the white.  Whereas the white keyboard I received was absolutely perfect for me and relieved by wrist pain, the black one is giving me wrist pain.I do not know if the black model is somehow designed to be different from the white in ways other than color, or if this is a sample variance.  That two keyboards of the same model could be so different is unfortunate.  I am docking a star for this reason.  I may return the black model and trying my hand at another white model to see if it is the same as the first one I bought.  It is harder to recommend this keyboard if copies can vary so much from one to another."", ""I work from home 100% of the time and therefore needed a keyboard that could withstand the heavy typing I have to do for work plus the medium amount of typing I might do for personal purposes, whether it be commenting/replying to posts on social media or gaming.At first I thought a gaming keyboard was the way to go.  I started with a $25 Red Imp keyboard, then some of the keys started acting up, where a single keystroke resulted in duplicate strokes on the display.  I upgraded to a Razer keyboard and that worked for a while, but then like the Red Imp, the Razer's keys started sticking and resulting in duplicate character strokes.  Some keys weren't responsive at all.  I popped off all the keys, gave it a good cleaning, and that only made things worse.As I was cleaning the keyboard, a memory popped into my head.  When I was working in the office (had been working from home since the start of the lockdowns, I was using a KeyTronics keyboard.  In the 18 years I had been with the company up to that point (still with them), I had gone through exactly two keyboards.  I'd used the first one for at least 15 years before finally having to switch out to a new one.  I.T. had been handing out slightly smaller, membrane keyboards.  I tried it for exactly one minute before deciding I hated it.  I went back to I.T. and they handed me a new KeyTronics keyboard, which was black, whereas my old one was beige.So, I went looking for KeyTronics keyboards, and the Perixx Periboard-106 was the first result.  After reading through the reviews, and seeing many references to the old IBM electric typewriters or keyboards, I knew this was the one to get.The keys respond quickly to the touch, The ergonomic design doesn't hurt my wrists, and best of all, I have a feeling this keyboard will be around a long time."", 'It feels nice when typing. The material is OK and I like its vintage look.... The product met my expectations', ""The keyboard is nice retro design, and is of good quality. However, sometimes normal pressing on the keys when typing fast is not enough so it skips the characters. It is not so useful for work or everyday heavy usage. But overall I'm happy with the product."", 'I needed keyboards to meet 2 criteria; (1) ""mechanical"" keyboard and (2) 1"" of space above the function keys.  I\'ve always like the feel of the old Microsoft and IBM mechanical keyboards (full height keys, responsive, and the sound of the keys being depressed).  The ""quiet"" keyboards don\'t have alot of travel and therefore don\'t have a good ""feel"" in my opinion.  Also, the Escape and function keys on quiet keyboards are so small, I can\'t tell if I\'m pressing them.All keys are in the classic layout (ESC is set away from other function keys, backslash is where it should be (above the enter key).  normal size Enter key, cursor keys are positioned in the classic keyboard style).  You can press the spacebar anywhere and there\'s no binding.  Same thing for the Enter and Plus keys on the numeric keypad.  The curve is very ergonomic and doesn\'t make your hand or fingers uncomfortable.I needed the 1"" space because I still have a Wordperfect function key template that I use with WP 12.  Most of the new keyboards don\'t offer any space to tape my template.If you\'re looking for a classing corded keyboard, this is the ticket.', 'I was looking for a standard keyboard with substance to the keys (not the low profile, soft touch keyboards). This is it! Excellent keyboard over the past 2 years and I look forward to using it for many more. I may just buy a back up keyboard to make sure I have a good working keyboard for many years to come, or use it on another computer. Worth the money.', 'After nearly two decades and three different computers, my old Chicony keyboard finally failed. I tried my reserve Microsoft 4000 Ergonomic for about a week and HATED it. So I got this Perixx. It has the Chicony\'s familiar layout and solid, almost ""clicky"" key feel. Maybe old school and a lot lighter than the Chicony, but an excellent keyboard.', 'This thing rattles a lot when you type on it. The build quality is meh. It\'s laser ablated, the font will rub off in a few months. If you think this is going to be like a Unicomp or IBM Model M or even a Unicomp Quiet Touch, absolutely not. When you poke the case, all the keys rattle.Build quality: Everything fits together but just. The case flexes a lot. The key caps are thin and wobbly. It will flex while you\'re typing on it.Ergonomics: The arc to the keys is extremely shallow compared to a Model M. But it\'s still more than you\'re going to get with mostly all of the standard mechanical keyboards besides the real Model Ms.Style: Yeah it kind of looks like a Unicomp Ultra classic. Not too bad! LEDs are on the bottom like the IBM Model Ms. Font is pretty dang good, before it starts fading. The stepped caps lock and modifier keys (Super, Alt, Menu) are different units than the real Model Ms. This is only a nitpick though.Typing experience: It\'s just a rubberdome board. Domes aren\'t too tactile. If there\'s anything that Perixx can do to make this board feel better is make the domes more tactile.Other Thoughts: I honestly wish Perixx made this board in a mechanical hotswap version as well so we can have a plain modern keyboard with custom switches in it. It would honestly make a HUGE difference. Also, the metal plate that the switches mount in would help with the flexing A LOT.Now if you\'ve gotten this far in my review and are thinking, ""Wow that sounds horrible!"", scroll up and look at the price tag. For 40 bucks (if it\'s not on sale) you are getting a cheap clone of a 104 dollar Unicomp Quiet Touch keyboard. If you want something that looks classic, yet do not want to shell out 100+ dollars on Unicomp keyboard that might take 1-2 months to arrive, you don\'t care about typing feel, this is the perfect option for you! I recommend pairing it with a beige Cherry USB mouse.Now if you think this is a mechanical keyboard or you\'re going to get clickety clack buckling spring sensations on this, I\'m just going to tell you now, you\'re not. Look elsewhere. Thanks for reading.']"

For me, it's only slightly uneven on the front left foot, but at this price this keyboard should not have this problem. If you put weight on the corner, you can hear the keyboard off balance and bounce against the desk whenever you use it. Using the kickstand helps, but the imbalance is still noticeable. I planned on only using this as a wired keyboard, but thought the bluetooth option was a nice touch. However, there is a charging/charged led light that never turns off on the capslock button. It is either red or blue and bothers me since the rest of the keyboard's lights can be controlled and customized, but this bright led sorely stands out. This light is even brighter than the rest of the keys. There is an amazing range of rgb colors, but the brightness is not bright enough for a lit room. I'm not too big on rgb, but I think this is a big selling point of this keyboard and in my opinion they didn't hit the mark with this one. The leds don't light up the fn or secondary functions of the keys well due to the led being located on the top portion of the keys. It's not too big of a deal, since it can help in keeping the look less cluttered when using the keyboard in the dark, but sometimes you need to see all the different fn keys and the low brightness and amount of shine through does create a problem. Another selling point for this keyboard is the ambient led on the borders of the keyboard, but its low brightness doesn't really do much for the looks in a well lit room. You can only appreciate the rgb capabilities in a very dark setting.The keyboard looks amazing on picture and feels pretty nice, but the uneven feet, surprisingly low brightness, and annoyingly bright and continuous charging led is enough to warrant a return especially for a keyboard at this price."", ""I don't usually write reviews but I was so pleased with this keyboard, I had to!Low profile switches? Check. No twangy metallic sound upon a keystroke? None whatsoever. Wireless capability? Has it. Excellent RGB? Some of the best to date IMO.This is a superb little keyboard. It has a remarkably small footprint on the desk but doesn't feel cramped to type on whatsoever. Highly portable for on the go use, too. Blue clicky is of course the loudest switch type, so don't be expecting a quiet keyboard, but this rendition is not excessively loud. If sound isn't an issue, try blue switches. They feel awesome and responsive; there is a type-writer kind of satisfaction to using them.Cooler Master delivered a really solid little unit with this guy, and its very hard to find all of these elements in one keyboard at this price point. Solidly built and a pleasure to use. If you're looking for a 60% keyboard, or are interested in trying one, this is a stellar option."", 'Buenísima opción de compra.

From day one, it was like wrestling just to type with accuracy. I type 135 WPM and formerly transcribed. So when I tell you that this is not a ""typist\'s keyboard"" as their paid advertisements are telling you, I mean it with all my heart. This board made the cheaper gaming keyboards I bought seem productive.If you are looking for a ""typist\'s keyboard,"" this is not it. Don\'t let fancy ""switch"" names like topre fool you. Trash is trash no matter what you market it as. This board is almost impossible to use for long stretches of time and is like wrestling with the switches themselves, which cause an uncomfortable bump and often have slow reaction time to the presses. The keys are not conducive to long stretches of typing, and fatigue sets in very quickly. IF YOU WANT AN OLD-TIME, ""TYPIST\'S BOARD"" for comfortable typing in long stretches, AVOID THIS KEYBOARD. It\'s a tinker toy for almost $300.* UpdateI\'ve owned this keyboard less than two weeks. The keys are already sticking, and a couple of days ago, key wobble started. I fervently believe that Amazon is selling defective items from warehouses. This will be my last Amazon.com purpose for the rest of my life. Every keyboard I\'ve bought from them has been defective in some way. This one worked fine on day one and by day three, the keys were wobbling and sticking.The keys are magnified probably 500 times in the website picture and show a high-key design. It\'s not. The keys are actually lower than a low profile keyboard I owned a couple of years ago. Disgusted with Amazon.com, the products that they ""let"" other people sell on their flea market, and the fact that they\'ve changed their returns to a full 14 days before I\'m refunded. Absolutely incredible. No business deserves to be rewarded for selling junk.Done with Amazon.That\'s my keyboard. You\'ll notice the red on the box. I cut myself opening the cheaply and poorly made box. So that\'s actually blood you\'re looking at there. Always nice to rip a finger open trying to open a keyboard so you can work.The keys are much lower than they look in photos. Keys are comfortable for sure and feel good to touch, but I\'m not typing to massage my fingers. I\'m trying to work. Accuracy and speed actually went down on this keyboard from a cheap Logitech board just four years ago (150 WPM to just 106 WPM on this board and every other mechanical keyboard I\'m buying).I\'m having an extremely hard time finding a board that\'s meant for typing. All the boards are expensive Christmas lights that end up as doorstops or desktop décor because they\'re not functional as boards. All I can come up with is that keyboard companies are selling to college students who are going to press the same 4-5 keys and 10 shortcuts over and over again as hard as they can with two fingers?This one was advertised as a work board, which was one reason I got it. The last board I ordered was a Corsair K70 that ended up being junk and having key chatter just 10 months in. So I spend an extra $100 to grab this one, and lo and behold, it\'s not really any better. Just guessing that if Amazon sells it, it\'s junk. Third board I\'ve bought off here and it\'s trash.Sending it back and re-ordering again. Maybe a $400 board will work for typing? It\'s pretty sad when you have to go on a treasure hunt for a real keyboard just to use a desktop these days. They used to come with those bricks standard, and they were good for typing right out the box. Now? I\'ve got a kiddie toy on my desk.', ""I am absolutely in love with this keyboard. I listened to people typing with it online and was at first skeptical. YouTube videos cannot articulate the feeling and crisp sound of this keyboard. It has such a nice thocc and quality feel that I become excited to use it just by seeing it. I also appreciate the retro and minimalistic design. It reminds me of the old-school mechanical keyboards from the 80s and 90s, one of which I used to own. The keyboard itself is also an absolute brick. It doesn't matter if you are a writer, coder, or gamer; this thing is quality and feels like it is built to last. I am very happy I bought this keyboard even though it was pretty expensive. It's the perfect in-between mushy and mechanical switches. It has the best of both worlds without compromising too much. If you have the money and are looking for a new keyboard, this is it."", 'Three weeks ago I bought eleven keyboards (all well known, highly rated) and compared them during a two hour shoot-out.  Why?  Because I didn\'t know anything about switch weights, heights, colors, springs, sound, manufacturers, tenkeyless, etc., that apparently affect how a keyboard feels and thus how effective/productive one is AT the keyboard.The RealForce was the most expensive of the bunch but it turns out that to me it\'s definitely worth that expense.During due diligence I recall reading posts and watching YouTube videos that mentioned how the RealForce ""topre"" switches have a feel that is indescribable when compared to other switch types.  I needed to see for myself.My fingers can sometimes get ""lazy"" and mis-hit a key.  I discovered that the Topre keys make it easier to type on/with and so I make less mistakes on it.  Making less mistakes is just a bonus however.  What I like most about the RealForce is the tactile sensation it provides.  The best way to put it is to say it\'s got a buttery smooth feel -- it\'s just got that certain something that no other keyboard I tried had.I really wanted some of the other brands to be ""the one"" based in large part on an irrational bias that came from reading associated 4-star glowing reviews authored by users/programmers who I figured should know more than I.And also I couldn\'t believe that keyboards made THAT much of a difference and even if they did they shouldn\'t be priced more than $99.  Well, I was wrong.Okay.Live and learn.To those on the fence, I strongly encourage you to bring in at least five different types of boards to compare against the RealForce.  A/B testing in real time is the only reliable way to know for certain what will work ""best"" for your needs.', 'Buen embalaje, buena calidad y buena durabilidad', 'UPDATE:After returning a couple of pieces finally got a piece that sits flat. And oh my, now it is pure perfection. Also, if you are used to thin, low profile keys like on magic keyboards then it might take a while to adjust to somewhat higher keys on this, but well worth it IMO.RANT:This keyboard shows what pathetic hardware quality has become these days (except Apple) with manufacturers trying to cheapen the product. Full marks to Fujitsu for bringing back a strong peripheral.ORIGINAL:This keyboard is literally awesome. My fingers totally love it and never wonna leave it. The build quality is jaw dropping. Reminds you of the quality of computation equipment like 30 years ago if you know what I mean.BUTFor whatever reason it does not sit flat! There is a slight wobble as the top left corner sits a couple millimeters higher. I tested this on various flat surfaces where other keyboards work fine. I have no idea how the good folks who created such quality left this nigalling problem.Now I’ve tried the full size and the half size keyboard, same issue. 😕 will be returned. But I so like this keyboard that I’ll try another piece. Just in case I get lucky.', ""The Realforce brand set the standard for Topre (as it should have, seeing it's their in house brand) and it's fair to say the expectations for the second product lineup was pretty high. The new R2 lineup delivers on that expectation in my opinion with more options for consumers than ever before. I have tried many Topre boards in the last couple of years, and ended up liking the Realforce 87u 55G best of all, and has taken it's place as my main keyboard. So why did I buy this one? As a gift for someone who prefers a full size layout - for those that are unaware, the 55G Topre switches were, until now, only available in a TKL version. So how does this one compare to the 87u? If you're like me and prefer a more retro look, the older Realforce boards may be more appealing to you... but make no mistake, these new ones are of the same high build quality standards set by their predecessors. The new sleek chassis and modern design looks great, and pictures don't do it justice. Around back, they added more rubber feet and fixed the cable routing channels from being too tight like the first generation. But who cares about looks, anyone who's serious about Topre is mainly concerned with the experience, and the 55G switch on this board is once again an amazing experience, feeling as good, if not slightly more refined, than my 87u. This review is mainly aimed at people that are already familiar with Realforce boards and Topre in general, and I won't be going in depth on Topre switches, as I feel that would get too long winded and there is already a lot out there on that topic.With Fujitsu taking over as distributor for the US, I can only hope that availability of these amazing keyboards will get better."", 'For those deciding whether to get variable or 55g , the difference is 55g would be good if you are used to cherry mx brown switches. Variable felt very sticky as the grams reduced, it wasn’t as tactile with a bounce like the 55g, much like a red switch. The variable’s 35g was the worst. Light to actuate but sticky. It didn’t feel premium. I was worried 55g would be too hard to press. No it isn’t, but I didn’t get faster wpm by 15% being on variable. I code so it’s more about thinking that how fast I can type. So that reduced speed didn’t matter.Anyway get the 55g. You can’t go wrong. This is my favourite keyboard ever! I can’t wait to code everyday just so I can feel the keys.', ""Perfect size, perfect key feel when typing.  If you spend all day at a keyboard like many people, I feel like you'll not regret this even though it is fairly expensive for a keyboard.  Your fingers will thank you.  I believe I type more accurately with a good solid action like this keyboard has.  Also it just feels good.  And has held up a while now.  I think I'll get a second one for my travel kit."", ""I literally bought this 2 days after I bought the Leopold FC660C, which happened to be my first Topre switch keyboard. Being a mechanical keyboard enthusiast who has bought many mech keyboards from different brands, sizes, and switches, I'm a full topre switch convert. Topre is just better and the hype is real.Unfortunately, this keyboard misses the mark. Maybe my review is biased after using the FC660C which is a much better keyboard.The pros: The Topre Keyswitches and TKL lay out and that's it. The heavy 55g switches are good for gaming.Cons:The 55g switches are just too stiff. The 45g of the FC660C is just right and feels like typing on clouds. This feels like typing on a very stiff tactile mech switch. In use for productivity or anything else than gaming, your hands will tire out.The keycaps aren't as good as the FC660C. The FC660C keycaps have this nice feel that adds to the typing experience. These keycaps are stiff.Black legends on black keycaps. Kind of looks nice, but impossible to see in the dark or any low lighting. If you have the keyboard layout memorized, not an issue except for those symbols.The keyboard itself is just very large and seems to take a lot of space. No good thock sound. Just mediocre in my opinion for this price point.""]"

These keyboards are for pony computers and not for our main automation PC which uses and expensive Keytronics KB.  We needed a small footprint because the special keyboard shelf built into the console space has just enough room for two of these and the bigger Keytronics KB which features a numerical keypad.  I\'m happy to report a gentle tactile response with these boards and the chicklet keys feel nice.  The piano finish is not glaring under the overhead lights, nor is it encompassing of the whole KB, the keys themselves are actually a matte finish, but compliment the board nicely.  The letter stenciling is a thinner font than I\'d prefer, so it remains to be seen how long the stenciling on the keys holds up to daily use by our announcers.  Older keyboards seemed to have tougher letter stenciling than the ones made today and held up longer.  But given the lifespan of a keyboard today seems to be only 4 to 5 years, I guess if the stenciling only lasts that long, then it\'s good enough.  Other than Logitek or Microsoft I really don\'t trust any KB under $30 these days to be that durable in a work environment, but given that we needed this size of footprint at a budget price, I guess we\'ll give it a try.  So far, so good.  One was plugged directly into the PS-2 of the PC sitting in an alcove on the console and the computer booted right up and I was able to use the KB right away with no difficulties.  The other KB was hot-plugged into the receiver end of a KVM for one of the pony computers.  It, too, was recognized right away and was able to be used (and that was on a WinXP PC).  KB works with WinXP or & no problem.  The only complaint I have is that there\'s no power light to confirm the KB is active on the PC.  Since there\'s no numerical keypad, the numlock light won\'t light, even though there appears to be a position for it right on the board.  They could have made the numlock light up anyway, even though it\'s obvious you can\'t use numlock on this key layout, just so there\'s an ""active"" light to let you know the KVM or PS-2 is communicating properly.  Caps and scroll lock lights work fine.  I gave it four stars because it\'s clear the build quality is not quite that of a Logitek or MS Keyboard.  But, it\'s still pretty decent.

Get complimented on it all the time at work, too!', 'I love this desk memo! I’ve been using it since high school, and I’m in second year university now. It’s good for visualizing what you have to do in a week, and I like that it includes “this weekend”, “next week” and “snowball in hell” columns for coward planning. The snowball in hell idea is cute because I’m sure we all have things that keep piling up without us being able to finish it sooner. Anyway, I love this product. I recommend it!', 'Have found this Knock Knock pad very useful  Like their products!', 'This works great as a mouse pad and the perfect place to make to-do lists or take notes. The pages are thicker than expected... giving it a sturdy / quality feel. The back of the pad is cardboard providing a solid / smooth writing surface.Before purchasing, I was a little nervous that the corners of the page would start to ""curl"" up (like my legal pad does after even just the slightest use). However, I was pleasantly surprised to find a tear off on the top of the pad and the left side of the pad. The keeps the pages flat - for a neat / clean look.The top right hand corner reads:Hopes for this week (with check boxes for High Medium and Low)Results of the week (with check boxes for High Medium and Low)The middle section displays:The days of the week ""Monday - Friday"" with a write-in place for the date below the day of the week.It also alternates  white and light orange lines for making notes/task lists.At the bottom of each day there is a check box.

At just over A5, this doesn’t clutter your desk, but perhaps the best feature of this pad is its adaptability.There are headings for each day the week, boxes for forward planning, and a space to add specific dates, but with plenty of white space available you can easily adapt this to your own needs – mine usually features a To-Do list, a list of books I want to read, train travel times, and contact details for upcoming appointments. It’s great value for money too, with 60 sheets on each pad it lasts for ages.Hint: This particular design is becoming increasing difficult to obtain, so grab them while you can!', 'Great product.', ""This is amazing and I love that it even has a place to store my pen. The only negative for me is it was slightly larger than I was anticipating. With my desk setup my key board ends up needing to overlap this a little and that makes my keyboard slant due to how thick this is. I will still use it and I'm sure ill get use to it with time so for now its just a slight annoyance.""]"

Also, straight out of the box the ESC keycap was busted at the stem? How does that even happen? Corsair's fault or Amazon's? Additionally, the ESC key and all the keys below it on that side simply had zero functionality and the 1 key would only register some of the time.

The lighting is so beautiful and easily customizable using ICUE. I modded mine with pe foam, eva foam, and the tempest tape mod and it sounds pretty good, definitely less hollow sounding. Overall it’s a pretty good keyboard if you want good lighting and silver switches', 'If you’re not into the custom keyboard culture and have very particular and high expectations to how keyboards should be, this keyboard is just fine.I specially bought this keyboard for competitive fps games since the k65 predominantly sells silver switches, which are very quick switches, perfect for competitive gaming. Some say the switches sound scratchy, but I believe that’s just an opinion and that you should decide for yourself whether or not it sounds good for you. The keyboard has been very responsive to me, and I haven’t found any issues, if any.', 'Justo lo que quería. Bastante suave el tacto de cada tecla y su RGB es bastante agradable. Muy recomendado.', 'What I can say about this mechanical keyboard is this: Firstly because of a warehouse deal on damaging packaging I purchased for 50 bucks shipped.So for the right price, with the correct understanding of mods & their execution I have been able to make an absolute beast of a gaming keyboard for very cheap.Less than 70 bucks. It sounds great, has the shorter actuation point of cherry silvers, very little bottom travel for fast resets of key presses.I added weights to the corners of the board to make it heavier.The keyboard has zero flex, sounds fantastic, and preforms wonderfully for gaming after modding. I am good with soldering if ever needed, so for me it not having hot swap is okay, because of the massive saving I have made on this build.', ""This product has so many people commenting (its pingy, its too loud, its this and that) in reality. Yes this keyboard does have some? if not any ping, you can add something inside if its not your liking because their are YouTube videos for it. if you don't its actually just fine. The Cherry reds feel so good.I currently come from a 2015 Razer Chroma black widow. It was loud, too big, and annoying. Its reaction timing was horrible for games likeValorant, Apex, MMO'S and Warzone. I've got 500 hours on almost each game. And I could say this is the best keyboard for feeling in control and adding to other amazing Corsair products. The software is amazing overall and causes you to have a more organized time.Is it the best? No, you can build your own keyboard for less. But if you don't want to do that, buy this one on sale. Or better yet put more money in and buy a ducky. The problem is that it depends your taste in keyboards and feel.I'm a more competitive/relax gaming person, I'll play slow games like MMORPG'S and then play competitive Valorant/Apex. I'd say it works for both perfectly. It takes time learning the FN+ F1 keys and etc. But flows easily like a normal keyboard.In total I'd recommend it for anyone looking for a good 60% keyboard!""]"

Rubber feet on the bottom prevent major sliding or slipping.Only negative is my first unit wasn’t completely flush against the keyboard - there was a slight humpOr bow in the middle that perhaps wasn’t completely sanded down so there would be a slight wobble when set against the keyboard.

I'll probably end up sanding it and re-varnishing to keep it smooth to the touch. Otherwise the fit and function is great and the large rubber pads underneath are solid for keeping it from sliding."", 'Was contacted by seller to rectify issue. Increased rating for great customer service.———-First impression was great and as expected. Perfect size and height for a Keychron K2. Used for 1 week of general typing and the finish started to wear out after a few days. The wood started to fray and is now discoloured. This wrist wrest needs to arrived better oiled or lacquered to maintain its initial appearance. The surface has become rough after one week of light use.

Ich habe sie im Sale für ~30€ (statt regulär ~80€) erworben, was mMn ganz angemessen ist, für die Gesamtqualität. Sie ist recht groß und daher eher für größere !rechte! Hände geeignet. Seit über 15 Jahren habe ich 2 Stück Razer Diamondback der ersten Generation (laufen bis heute beide noch!!), aber zum Sale durfte es mal was neues sein. Da ich von Razer an sich total überzeugt bin, aufgrund meiner positiven Erfahrung, wollte ich keinen anderen Hersteller für meine neue Maus. Ich bin ganz zufrieden, jedoch nicht sonderlich begeistert mit meinem Erwerb. Nach gut 4 Wochen nun mein Fazit.Positiv: Sie ist, wie von Razer gewohnt, extrem präzise in der Bewegung. Im Spiel werden kleinste Bewegungen umgesetzt. Ich spiele sowohl Shooter als auch Aufbauspiele und die Präzision ist super. Die Abtastrate (dpi - also die Empfindlichkeit) lässt sich mittels der Tasten hinter dem Scrollrad nach oben und unten variieren. Dazu ist sie sehr leichtläufig in der Bewegung, sie gleitet auch auf gröberen Oberflächen sehr weich, auf meinem Gaming-Mousepad ohne spürbaren Widerstand, fast als ob sie schwebt. Die ergonomische Form ist gut, aber wie erwähnt eher für größere Hände gedacht. Optisch finde ich sie sehr hübsch - stylisch aber nicht zu aufdringlich, wie so manch andere Gaming-Modelle die aussehen wie Transformers. Die Daumentasten sind groß und gut platziert.Negativ: Sie wirkt billig (Oberfläche/Haptik) und ich persönlich finde sie zu leicht. Für andere ist ein leichtes Gewicht sicherlich ein Pluspunkt. Das Scrollrad ist schwammig und unpräzise, leider kenne ich das genauso auch von meinen alten Razer Mäusen. Andere Hersteller machen das Mausrad besser und bieten zB auch eine horizontale Scrollfunktion mit dem Mausrad, Razer hier nicht, was für mich ein Manko ist in dieser Preisklasse. Was ich persönlich eine Zumutung finde, ist die Software aufgrund ihrer Größe von über 400MB, was soll das? Aber sie läuft auch mit dem PnP-Treiber von Windows gut, wenn man also nicht an der Beleuchtung rumspielen will oder Makros braucht, braucht man auch die Software nicht zwangsläufig, Windows händelt sie mit Boardmitteln zufriedenstellend.Fazit: Es ist Jammern auf hohem Niveau. Die Maus ist gut und im Sale empfehle ich sie weiter. Für den regulären Preis von 80€ würde ich jedoch mehr Qualität in der Haptik erwarten. Mein Haupt-Manko ist das unpräzise Scrollrad, das hat Razer nach meiner Erfahrung und Meinung in den letzten 15 Jahren in der Mittelklasse nicht zufriedenstellend gelöst, andere machen diesen Punkt besser.', ""I'm a female gamer with smaller hands, and I was looking for a replacement for my  ROG Strix Evolve which I loved, but the model is getting old and I wanted something a little more recent. I bought the Razer Viper V2 Mini, and am very pleased with both the size and performance. If anything, this mouse might even be a bit on the smaller side for my hand and grip, but I got used to it quickly.Very reactive mouse with decent software to personalize the functions. The scroll wheel is easy to click, one of the issues I had with the ROG Strix was a very stiff scroll wheel clic, to the point that I avoided using keybinds on it. The button clicks on the mouse are crisp and input can be tweaked on the software. Overall very satisfied!"", 'Kind of heavy and big not for people with small hands', ""I love the feeling of the mouse, the buttons and the scrolling wheel are all perfect. Only Problem would be the cable. Its just plastic, normally razer mouses have a special light weight cable but this is just plastic. A bit annoying if you've had higher quality mouses in the past, but overall really good for its price, might even be the best in its price range."", ""I wanted to go for the Viper Mini, but that mouse went out of stock very fast. I found this as the better option as it was like Rs. 300 off from its usual price (1500~1600 rupees).For that price, this is a decent mouse. This doesn't have R&B, since you only have the green logo. Mouse is big and its perfect fit for someone with bigger hands.The software is fine. I don't use it that much since I'm used to 1000 DPI.The side buttons are okayish, atleast they dont feel like you're gonna break the mouse.Now the biggest thing that might bother people. The CABLE.Many people say they recieved a duplicate, cheap copy of the mouse because the cable is not braided or it's not Razer's Speed Flex something something cable. I also recieved the mouse without braided cable, but it is original. The packaging is original, it's better quality than what you will find on a cheap knockoff.Earlier versions of this mouse came with braided cable, but after some time, the newer batches were modified and braided cable was removed and replaced with a normal cable. Now this normal plastic cable ain't that bad. It's thicker and better than a 1mm plastic wire. It would've been better to get a braided cable, but its better.If you can spend like 300~400 extra, get the G102, because RGB (why not?) and the software is better in my opinion.And if the Viper Mini is back in stock, I'll highly suggest you to go for that mouse. It's a spectacular mouse for the less money that you're paying.I'll update it maybe after 1 year."", 'Tenía dudas y miedo a la hora de comprar este mouse ya que mis manos son grandes y estaba buscando un mouse bueno, bonito y barato.

All my Razer peripherals are colour changing and I'm yet to be disappointed. I haven't changed the default settings in the Razer synapse application but they offer even more choices+ There's only one USB cable rather than multiple like their other peripherals (but I still needed a USB extension cord since Razer likes taking up my ports)- The entire bottom is covered in rubber gripping but it still keeps shifting on my wooden deskI thought the surface would feel gritty like sandpaper since I saw what it looked like online, but it's comfy with texture and within a day it felt smoother than when I first got it which made my mouse perform even better.

Essendo stato possessore sia di un Razer Mamba (1° e 2° generazione) sia di una tastiera meccanica BlackWidow Chroma V2, non ho potuto fare altro che procurarmi questo interessante tappetino per completare il set.Il prodotto arriverà nella sua elegante confezione nero/verde nella quale sono presenti gli ormai classici adesivi e un libricino dedicato alla garanzia. Dal punto di vista del design il prodotto di Razer si fa veramente apprezzare per la cura nei dettagli e il suo sapiente gioco di colori (16 milioni di colori per 19 zone di illuminazione). Per quello che riguarda la parte pratica, che in fondo è quella che interessa noi gamer, Razer Firefly si fa amare in ogni ambito in cui viene usato, capace di offrire massime prestazioni ""in-game"" e, nello stesso tempo, un\'ottima esperienza di uso standard, in particolare nella sua ""Cloth Edition"". Sul prodotto è altresì presente una porta USB 2.0 che può essere utilizzata per collegare varie periferiche.Ovviamente non è tutto oro quel che luccica, infatti, il tappetino (...come anche la tastiera che ho recensito qui su Amazon.it) mi ha creato non pochi problemi durante l\'integrazione con la nuova versione del software Synapse 3.0 che ho dovuto installare per poter utilizzare il mouse Mamba 2019 (2° gen). Non sto qui a raccontarti tutta la storia, ma posso solo dire che la compatibilità hardware/software mi ha decisamente deluso, troppi problemi che mi hanno portato a preferire prodotti della concorrenza. Un vero peccato.PRO✔️ Elevate prestazioni;✔️ Design accattivante;✔️ Qualità dei materiali;✔️ Piacevole al tatto;✔️ Porta USB 2.0 integrata.CONTRO❗️ Pessima compatibilità tra software (Synapse 3.0) e periferiche Razer;❗️ Rapporto qualità/prezzo influenzato negativamente dai problemi software.GIUDIZIO FINALEI prodotti Razer restano una garanzia e un riferimento per l\'intero settore dell\'hardware dedicato al gaming, ciononostante, i continui problemi riscontrati con la componente software (driver e Synapse 3.0) delle periferiche come questo mouse pad, la tastiera o il mouse rendono il loro acquisto non molto conveniente, visto il prezzo al quale sono venduti.']"

It is a classic razer mouse and the quality of materials used is second to none. Similar mouses from in this range are no match to the Razer Atheris.PROS -1. It is small and ergonomic, you can even store it in your pocket. You can use it on multiple surfaces without any issues as it has sufficient rubber pads at the bottom to secure it on the surface on which it is kept.2. The weight of the mouse is on the heavier side and thus gives a premium feel while using it. I have used logitech's M331 but it just doesn't have the same weight and feel.3. There are 2 dedicated buttons on the side of the mouse which can be programmed for anything as per your needs by using the Razer Synapse app. The razer synapse app in itself is a premium feature. It gives you all the details of your mouse and even shows you battery levels.4. You can change the dpi easily with the dedicated button in the middle. The two left and right clicks are very satisfying (not silent)5. You can store the USB dongle inside the mouse itself and thus never lose it.6. The mouse has Bluetooth connectivity as well in case you are using it with a device that doesn't have USB ports, such as Ipad.7. It is ambidextrous so you can use the mouse even if you are left handed.8. The texture on the sides of the mouse is made of a rubbery finish and thus improves the grip and makes you feel confident while moving the mouse around especially if you are a gamer.9. Coming to the best part of the mouse, The SCROLL WHEEL is the USP of this beauty. It gives a satisfying experience while scrolling. The scroll wheel automatically locks up while scrolling. So short scrolling while reading the pdf etc. is a beautiful experience as you will never overscroll which is a problem with many other mouses. The scroll wheels rubbered finish on top is beautiful and just too good. Your index finger will love you for this XDCONS -1. The only major con i found is that it uses a lot of battery. I have been using duracell batteries only with this mouse. With continued usage for about 5-6 months I've had to change the battery thrice.2. The mouse is on the smaller side so if you are someone with big hands you may have trouble as your fingers will definitely stretch beyond the mouse.All in all a commendable product from Razer which is very premium and leaves you satisfied with its scrolling experience with that beautiful scroll wheel. I would not suggest looking anywhere else if your budget is below three thousand."", 'Ma copine a des petites mimines, cette souris est parfaite ! Trop mini pour mes grosses patounes cependant !', ""I was looking for a gaming mouse after by G402 started having double click issues after 3 years of use. My goal was to get something accurate and low DPI accessibility(at least 400) . Since my gaming hours were going down but I am fond of using the gaming mouse for other activities as well, this seemed to be a good buy because of cost(1700), the two extra buttons, adjustable DPI, good accuracy and because it was Razer.Pros :- The mouse is really compact and small.- Decent accuracy compared to other mice in the same prize range- Good tactile left and right clicks- Wireless- Programmable buttons through the razer app. This is very beneficial if there are certain things you do quite often and would like it to be done withing clicks of your mouse.Cons- Very small : Coming from G402, the switch to this is very difficult. It is way too small for my palms- Connectivity issues : My laptop is generally kept around a meter away from the mouse and I still get connectivity issues in both bluetooth and 2.4 ghz dongle mode. The lag is tooo much and you cannot game at all.- Bad side buttons : The side buttons are feel very soft and you'll end up pressing both of them at the same time quite often- No RGB. This is probably to improve the overall battery life but then again with a general usage of over 12 hours daily, two AA batteries barely lasted a month for me.Overall for general usage, this is a decent mouse but if general usage and wireless  is what you're looking for, there are plenty of other options at a cheaper cost."", 'Like: Shape, weight, feel. Actually comfortable. Buttons in logical, expected spots. Nicely ""stiff"" scroll wheelDislikes: Too early to tell. Will update if the thing fails early proves unreliable.Bottom line: A good feeling, nicely designed wireless mouse - which is something that is harder to find than it should be. Other manufacturers take note.So, I\'ve bought too many mice in my search for a decent, all purpose, small wireless mouse with Bluetooth - I don\'t want to have to remember a dongle, as I guarantee I will leave it behind when I need it. Plus, why is it so hard for manufacturers to make a quality, usable, cordless mouse? Don\'t put the buttons in weird spots. Don\'t make the scroll-click unusable. Don\'t assume just because I want cordless portable mouse means I want a boring, plasticky mouse, but also maybe I do want to play a game or two with it - but I don\'t need it to light up like a Christmas tree. In short, maybe, just maybe, design a quality, small, Bluetooth mouse.I think this is finally the mouse I\'ve been looking for - I have a Logitech for my desktop computer, but for my old gaming laptop and my 2-in-1 I use at Uni, I was looking quality mouse that would easily pair and have Bluetooth. The Razer Atheris fits the bill, plus i got it for a low price  on sale - close to the price of a mouse with a cord. It has a 2.4GHz  dongle, plus Bluetooth capable. It pairs easily. You don\'t have to download any additional software but it will work with the Razer Synapse control software. The scroll wheel is pleasantly stiff (I hate twitchy scroll wheels like on the small Bluetooth Logitech mouse I have where a touch scrolls wildly), plus the buttons are in the regular, expected places (HP make a stylish mouse with the middle click is an awkward button behind the wheel - why, you sadists, why?), and it\'s a nice weight and shape and thus surprisingly comfortable to use. It\'s basically a well thought out little mouse with Bluetooth or high-powered USB receiver option.I\'ll give it 5 stars - there\'s nothing wrong with it, it\'s great straight out of the box - if there are any problems I\'ll come back and change the review, but for now, finally, a comfortable good wireless mouse. Well done, Razer!', 'First of all I would like to thank Logitecs crappy customer service who won’t send me or tell me where to buy a replacement receiver for my g304😢.Now the review-The Good:- I can’t find a better bluetooth or 2.4 mice at 1700₹- Great build quality and design (better than g304)- Can use Bluetooth if the receiver breaks ( unlike g304 😫 )- Input lag as low as g304 ( at least I can’t tell the difference )The Bad:- HEAVY as F*** ( reason being the 2 batteries inside), much heavier than any mouse in the picture.- I can imagine playing an online FPS with this, it’s uncomfortable moving it around too much because of it’s small size and not at all small weight. ( Even though I have medium size hand )Conclusion:If you are thinking of buying it for pure online FPS gaming purposes DON’T a 200₹ wired mouse would be a better option.If you are thinking of buying as a normal mouse with Bluetooth which you’ll use for some casual gaming ( or if you play Dota or something like that ) go ahead.', 'This is a very nice looking mouse from Razer being sold at irresistable price at amazon.in since it is a old model -Uses two AA batteriesHeavy but feels goodFast and Responsive, Ultra SensitiveFor connectivity supports both BT as well as 2.4 Ghz receiverBattery Life is mediorce at bestConsidering the small size and heavy weight not much useful for competitive gaming however you can still game as it is sensitive and accurate.', ""OK, let's go back to when I received the mouse.  Opened the packaging.  Everything was there but when I opened the mouse, the USB dongle was missing altogether.  I was shattered and was thinking of returning the mouse but I knew I could still use it over Bluetooth, which I did.The only major flaw I've had since I started using the mouse is that it keeps disconnecting from my PC over Bluetooth.  Some days, it would only disconnect once or twice while on other days, it would disconnect like 100 times within my time of using the PC.  I even checked many settings under the sun from guides online and it hasn't seemed to do anything to my mouse.But aside from the negatives, this mouse has an amazing battery life.  I've been using the mouse for around 550 hours now and I haven't even had to replace the batteries.  In fact, the batteries are still at 67% at the time of this review.As well, it's perfect for my tiny hands, which should be noted.Though I have had a mixed experience with mine, I would still recommend this mouse for the purpose of portability."", ""Connection flawless.Fits beautifully.Reacting to commands flawlessly.It's a bit heavier than other wireless mouse I have but I like that."", 'Wirklich gute kleine Maus!In erster Linie möchte ich die Qualität und Materialwahl herausheben. Razer verzichtet komplett auf Soft-touch! Solche Beschichtungen lassen ein Produkt hochwertiger erscheinen und sind einfach umzusetzen. Dadurch verkauft man mehr, aber Mäuse und Tastaturen wirken dann nach 1-2 Jahren abgegriffen. Meine Atheris ist bisher (neben meiner 2nd gen Orochi) die einzige Maus, die noch keine Abnutzung zeigt. Super!Die Ergonomie ist für eine kleine Maus ebenfalls gut. Durch die Silikon-Pads hat man guten ""Grip"" und auf einem Stoff mousepad gleitet sie perfekt. Die 2.4GHz wireless Verbindung ist schnell und präzise, aber nur auf kurze Distanz. Der Empfänger sollte in 1m Sichtlinie zur Maus platziert sein, um ein gutes Ergebnis zu erzielen. Bluetooth funktioniert ebenfalls gut, wenn man die Maus z.B. mit einem Laptop pairt und beides auf dem Tisch hat (dafür ist es ja auch gedacht). Wenn man aber einen preiswerten USB-Bluetooth-Empfänger im PC unter\'m Tisch nutzt, hakt der Cursor extrem. Dafür kann aber die Maus nichts.']"

This set is the same as the one from Drop.com, but with about a $20 markup. Since this is just a reseller, I'm not going to reduce my rating for value like I normally would, but I would probably recommend finding clones since GMK keycaps in general are very overpriced in my opinion.That being said, the $20 premium over drop.com's pricing is justifiable, since they will arrive much faster and you won't have to go through Drop's support in case of an issue, which is notoriously bad. In my opinion, this is worth the price difference and has come in handy when I've needed to complete a keyboard build for Christmas in a short period of time.Regarding the actual keycaps, they are GMK's so you can expect consistent quality, clear legends, and awful packaging. I don't get why GMK insists on using these awful recycled cardboard packages. They're incredibly flimsy and make it extremely difficult to get keycaps out of the box.Aside from that gripe though, they're the best (read, only) official Cherry-profile keycaps on the market, so the legends are consistently positioned and clear. The doubleshot ABS means that, even though you'll get shine on your keycaps over time, the legends won't wear off. The colorway is also consistent between both of the sets I've bought.Overall, I'd probably suggest finding some clones if you're not rushed, but if you need genuine GMK keycaps in a hurry, then these will suit you well, even if you are paying a bit of a premium.Pros:- The only Cherry-Profile keycaps on the market- Cool colorway that looks great in person and in photos- The base kit provides more keycaps than a typical GMK base kit, including numpad and some alternate modifiers and spacebars.- Consistent positioning and clarity of legends- Doubleshot keycaps means that legends won't wear away over time- Amazon seller means that you get Amazon support and quick shippingCons:- Expensive, with an additional premium due to being resold on Amazon- Awful packaging- Slightly less consistent clones can be purchased for less than a third of the price- ABS keycaps mean that your keycaps will start to shine over time with regular usage."", ""Wanted these when I first seen them, but they were sold out. Yes, I seen them too late. Waited and waited for another drop but ended up purchasing a different set. Seen them on amazon, with prime, had to get them. Will upload a picture soon.

I\'m not sure what the hype is about but I like a $40 PBT set just as much as these so far. I don\'t mind the ABS plastic but I think PBT sound a bit better.The ""S"" key in this set came with a blemish, the top layer of the double shot keycap had a scratch/hole in it so you can see the color underneath. It\'s on the side of the key so it\'s mostly out of sight but not really. You can see it easily from the side. Probably not going to look for an exchange just for that I guess. Debating it...but just goes to show the quality control on these.Absolutely not worth the money. I know this designer has the rights to use the cherry profile and all and everyone likes GMK, but just being honest - massive over hype.Definitely worth it if it was like half the cost. I could even see $70-80 just for the nice design and profile...but quality? Um, no. Don\'t get these for quality. Don\'t expect anything great. ONLY get these if you love the design. That\'s quite literally the only reason to get these keycaps. It\'s not for value, I can say that much.', ""The keycaps looked much better in the pictures than in person. I've never owned GMK keycaps but when I saw these in person, my first thought was that they didn't feel nor look as amazing as I thought they'd be. I think paying 200 CAD for these is a bit much. The colourway is still really cool, despite it looking a little different than in the pictures."", ""My first GMK kit after about a year of keyboard hobbying. The keycaps are sadly not as nice as many cheap 30 dollar clones. The legends are sharp and the colors are great, but the plastic shines out of the box, and there's an inconsistent finish on the sides of the keycaps. I regret this purchase a bit, but I'm glad that now I know that I'm not missing out on much from GMK. Compared to MT3 keys from drop, the quality is no contest."", 'Beautiful thocky keycap set. Pricey for what you get in terms of key variety though. Alternate space bars should have been included with the set and not sold separately in my opinion.

These sets on Amazon, not sure if that’s the problem or not but both that I received look like they are either refurbs or pretty bad QI on GMK’s part. They looked like they had oil brushed on the sides and front of the keys, also some of the keys had major shine on top of them as well, particularly I, G,H, and : “.  See pics attached. These keys are way too expensive to have these defects and inconsistencies, not like GMK at all, at least in the past when I’ve purchased directly from Drop.', 'Can’t believe that GMK keycaps are on Amazon for retail buy them fast before they sell out they are legit because drop is selling them']"

I started with the midar mz60 (yellow linear gaterons) kinetic sand, painters tape, dielectric grease. For around 100ish dollars (keycaps included) I have a solid build. The keycaps really made this keyboard marbley and pretty thocky (but marbley is much more noticeable) compared to the original sound the keyboard was giving off. I really think the keycaps helped a lot, right off the bat they were significantly heavier than the doubleshot abs. The texture, don't get me started it's so nice. Compared to abs or even cheaper pbt keycaps. For $50ish dollars these are a solid white keycap set. I forgot to mention these are white white not an off white color, so you'll be good to go on most moddable keyboards that are on amazon or any other site. Finally, the shine through is really good. Specifically the mz60 the rgb was so pretty, even more than my logitech and razer keyboards i was genuinely amazed."", ""I added these caps to a Glorious GMMK mechanical keyboard.  I realized that all I really needed or wanted was to add in the red caps from this set.  The black caps already on the keyboard would just be virtually the same as what I have, so no reason to tediously bother with that.And I'm fine with that because some of the default caps on my keyboard weren't always performing the best, and these caps actually fixed that.  Namely, the shift keys were a bit loose, and the space bar was really bad (It's black in this set so I used that one), and the replacements here work perfectly now.  Just a lucky bonus.They look classy - I keep the RGB on white so the black keys with white shine-through look great.  The Red keys, the light color comes out kind of pink.  I don't mind that so much, but it's the red/black color scheme that I like.  It's a trade-off if I want that, and I want to see what characters I'm typing.  Either way it gets the job done aesthetically enough for me.Combined with the improved(fixed) performance of the problem key caps, I'm very happy with this purchase and I recommend these caps."", 'Overall  good set of keycaps feels nice, characters are well defined and nice.

At least include a 7u spacebar. Why didn't I check before buying? Well, I thought I did, but it seems I didn't check hard enough.I did notice one thing, and that is excess friction on some of the stabilized keys that are standard.

With that said, I like most of the products that DROP releases, so while I know you can get a similar quality keycap set for cheaper with an attractive color scheme, I don't mind springing extra for this one because I like this particular color scheme.  My only REAL gripe with this set is that I originally intended it for a Everglide SK108 keyboard.  The only thing is, the extra 4 keys on the top right that would typically be reserved for calculator, and volume control keys, and this set doesn't include any of those.  Not really a big deal.  The problem is the extra 4 keys that it does have, are all a different profile (R3, R4 etc.) and as a result, they look uneven.  This is why these keycaps now sit on my TKL instead.

For my needs, these are quite nice if rather expensive.I bought these in Black for my GMMK (non-Pro) keyboard because I wanted a plain set of caps without any goofy fonts. And that's what they are... straight-up, no funny stuff, good quality caps. I don't notice any inconsistencies or rough edges like some reviewers noted. PBT material feels great. I agree that the font is on the thin side and limits brightness slightly, but personally I consider that a feature and not a bug. It's a very conservative-looking set of RGB caps, which is what I wanted. It is worth noting that the black caps are very dark gray and not jet-black, which I believe is a limitation of PBT vs ABS. This is not very noticeable unless you're looking for it in strong light. Not an issue for me but it might bother others.I'd prefer to have paid less than $55 for the set, but AFAIK it's the only plain black PBT doubleshot set available. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.""]"

I found only two, and this was one of them. I gave it a shot. I returned it.The keyboard feel was satisfactory if not particularly impressive. I could have lived with it.The problem was the function keys. Like many keyboards, the function keys have secondary function beyond being F1-F12. For example, some of the keys double as volume controls..What is unusual is that, unlike most keyboards, the function key to select the alternate functions (marked Fn in the picture) is not a one-time modifier. It's a toggle. I could live with a toggle IN ADDITION to a one-time modifier (e.g. like a shift key and caps lock key work), but with only a toggle, it was incredibly frustrating.Let's say I have music playing on low in my office with the door closed.

With a one-time modifier Fn key, I would know that I would either have to press F4 with or without the modifier. The gesture would be burned into muscle memory and I could do it quickly. With the toggle function, I can't just reach for the F4 key blindly because I don't know whether the toggle is on or off, i.e. whether the key will mute the music or will act as F4. I have to look down at the Fn key, see if the little green light is on, toggle it if it's in the wrong state, then press the F4. It got to be incredibly frustrating.I will also add that the placement of the Fn key is a little unusual between the Windows key and the Alt key.

Plug and play and very easy to use.', 'product as advertised.', 'I\'m going out of my way to write this review, and tempted to keep it a secret, but I feel obligated to save others the time and money I spent in my search for a ""gaming-worthy"" trackball mouse.  Aside from comfort and design, LEDs and other bells and whistles, most ""pro-gaming"" mice have two crucial settings for performance and accuracy; polling rate (the rate at which the mouse position is sampled) and DPI (the resolution at which the sampling occurs).Few trackballs offer adjustable DPI, and none of them offer higher polling rates, which makes the DPI settings almost useless in most cases.  Every trackball mouse I\'ve tested polls at a (default) rate of about ~128Hz (at best).  One can sometimes ""hack"" overclocking the USB port via 3rd party drivers (though I do NOT recommend doing this!), but it\'s just that; a hack.I have used trackball mice as my ""secret weapon"" since the days of the original Doom / Quake and the beginnings of eSports.  They are (were) far superior both in terms of comfort and control.  However, for whatever reason, perhaps influence from eSports companies / sponsors, trackballs have been left behind in terms of performance.  I own perhaps a dozen trackball mice; Including Elecom, Sanwa, and Logitech, including the original Logitech Trackman (still the best of the bunch).  Even the latest and greatest of the ""performance"" trackballs lack basic performance capability and some seem to try and compensate by offering additional bells and whistles that compromise the simplistic design (just try gaming with an MX Ergo while you press the right mouse button a little too hard to zoom in and accidentally tilt the mouse from zero to twenty degrees and your thumb slips off the trackball and hits the DPI switch from normal to ultra-super-high DPI).  It\'s the difference between ""frag or be fragged"" in the heat of battle.Where accuracy intensive weapons are concerned (e.g. Lightning gun or Rail gun in Quake), the polling rate is a critical setting to help ensure your mouse is polling fast enough to keep up with the game FPS (frames per second) which is dependent upon your GPU and Monitor refresh rate and DPI as well.  It\'s a delicate balance, and the last thing you need is laggy input devices.  If you\'re serious about gaming, these settings are nothing new.  Again, though, for whatever reason, trackballs have been left behind, and companies have yet to enable the same performance capabilities for their trackball mice offerings as they do for their ""pro-gaming"" mice offerings... until now.When I plugged in the Perixx, it was immediately recognized by the OS (Windows 10 Pro x64) as Full-Speed USB mouse.  This means I\'m getting nearly twice the polling rate at ~256Hz.  This is still nowhere near the 500-2000Hz pro-gaming mice offer, but this seemingly small change in polling rate make a _huge_ difference in games in terms of smoothness and accuracy.The Perixx trackball is flatter and wider than the Logitech offerings (which I do like for comfort).  However, the flatness does seem to keep one\'s wrist straighter, and the wideness provides extra support for your pinky finger.  I\'ve been playing 6 to 8 hour tourneys with little to no fatigue, and am very pleased by the comfort design.The Perixx trackball has less trackball surface / exposure than the Logitech M570 or original Trackman, but about the same as the MX Ergo.  I tend to prefer the larger surface area as this allows for more precise “full turns” (0-180 degrees) in game.  Also. it seems the ball bearings (on which the trackball sits and spins internally) are a bit too flush with the internal plastic trackball housing.  Occasionally I\'ll find myself pressing a bit hard on the trackball and it gets stiff in the socket.  This is my only complaint, and the only reason I can\'t give five stars.  I did buy an extra ""matte"" finish trackball, so perhaps I\'ll try different balls in the mouse to see if this problem goes away, but it is relatively minor issue and may go away with some use (mouse ""breaks-in"").  The Perixx is still by far the most accurate of the trackball mice I\'ve used, and I have seen immediate improvement with use of certain weapons in games.The Perixx buttons are responsive (low profile / short travel distance) with decent ""click"" feedback.  It has the typical wheel and forward / back buttons, but they did the mouse a great service by keeping it simple and not bloating it with too many buttons or odd positions or bells and whistles.  The mouse also has a 400/1000 DPI switch, which I probably won’t use in game, but is far better balanced than the drastic 512/2048 change in the MX Ergo and could potentially be used (with practice) for Zoom or precision aiming.  And the standard positioning of the DPI switch (behind the wheel) means no accidental in-game DPI resolution switching.I have hoped and prayed (and even begged companies like Logitech and Razer) for a decent pro/gaming trackball mouse with no answers... until this mouse landed on my doorstep.  As an experienced software / hardware engineer I even offered these companies my services to fix these problems or create new solutions for them, but it would seem they don’t consider anything to be broken.The design and engineering of the Perixx trackball mouse, along with (simply taking the time to implement) Full-speed USB firmware for better polling rates and performance, puts this ""value"" trackball far above the vast majority of more expensive ""performance"" trackballs (which are really anything but).', 'Yo lo compré xk tengo uno para el pc inalámbrico y me gusta mucho y me he acostumbrado a este formato. Pero en el portátil k tengo no funcionaba bien el inalámbrico, había veces k perdía conexión y en el de sobremesa nunca me pasaba, asik compré este con cable para k no perdiera nunca la conexión y desde entonces puedo usar muy bien el portátil con este ratón.', 'Esta sufriendo con mi anterior ratón y el del trabajo cuando me lancé a la búsqueda del ratón ergonómico ideal para mí. Descubrí que no hay que fiarse de la estética y que la forma del ratón es distinta según el tamaño de la mano. Por otro lado estaba indecisa si coger un ratón óptico o uno con trackball  y tenía curiosidad por estos últimos. Así que compré uno de cada.Si no se está acostumbrado se necesita un período de adaptación al trackball. Me adapté bien. La ventaja que le veía es que no hay que estar sosteniendo y desplazando el ratón. Otra ventaja es que resulta más cómodo para desplazar el ratón largos recorridos por la pantalla y más fácil precisión. Desventaja es que puede acumular suciedad ralentizando su respuesta o dejando de responder momentáneamente, se soluciona rápidamente limpiando los rodamientos y el trackball. A gustos. Yo estoy encantada.Perixx tiene un modelo de ratón para cada tamaño de mano (y como decía, tendrá una forma distinta). El envase de algunos ratones de perixx está diseñado para que puedas probar si el ratón se adapta a tu mano sin abrir el envase.', ""I occasionally like to dip my toes into trackball mice as they are far more comfortable for long sessions on the computer. In my current go around I decided to try this mouse. At first I was actually looking at their more expensive model, the 520 however based on the pictures and the video angles provided by the so called 'reviewers' on youtube I settled on the 517. Because the shape looked better for my hand vs the 520.First impressions, this is by far the most comfortable mouse I've had my hand on. Which falls between medium/large hands. I have long hands (usually large measurements, sometimes XL depending on sizing used) but very skinny so a lot of larger mice are too big and mice for medium hands are too small. This, compared to Logitech's value trackball, the m575, the angle is better in my opinion and doesn't strain my wrist from an awkward tilt on the mouse. I wish it was either a little more or less on the m575. Or just a slightly different shape (I hear people say the older design/model, m570,  was better/more comfortable. The other big thing is this mouse supports your whole hand and all fingers as opposed to having pinky hang off.  The premium version, MX ergo, suffers much of the same issues for me. The tilt, even being adjustable just doesn't feel right regardless of what setting/angle you use. There are other issues I had but they were little gripes here and there and probably falls under personal preference.With this being a value/budget oriented trackball it does have some issues. I am finding the standard ball that came with it to be a bit tight sometimes. It has a lot more resistance. This also seems to vary/fluctuate on how bad it is. Sometimes it isn't too noticeable, other times it will feel like it is catching occasionally or something and it gets harder to move/rotate ball to move cursor. It seems to have gotten a tiny bit better since I first got the item earlier today, so I am hoping it improves enough to not be annoying trying to daily this trackball.The other thing, and I do not know if this is a QC issue and I got a bad unit, or just the way it is because it is cheap, but the scroll wheel is absolute garbage. I would go as far as saying borderline broken. It has a lot of sideways play. This causes issues scrolling as the rubber wheel gets caught on either left or right click. As well as trying to use middle click. So far it seems scrolling works if you 'guide' the scroll wheel, though it is unfortunately just easier to switch to arrow keys temporarily. With the middle click, you might as well not even bother using it. Huge bummer as I am a heavy middle click user.As another review said,  there are not many performance trackballs available, and even what is labelled as such could hardly be called that in actual life. However this trackball overall is a great performer out of what is available. Offering essentials while leaving the extras out to reduce cost.Currently debating on either keeping this one and hoping the ball gets better with use and I guess just dealing with the faulty scroll wheel or return this to exchange another 517 or upgrade and try the 520.I will try to remember to update review."", 'This is a nice large trackball that fits my hand perfectly.  The standard buttons are normal size and there are two indentations to the side for your ring and little finger.  My hands are 4.5 inches from my thumb to my little finger across my palm, and this fills my hand completely so it is not laying on my desk.  The pointer is very sensitive compared to my previous trackball, but not uncontrollable.  I gave it a 4 on ergonomic just because I am accustomed to a trackball that has a steeper angle under my hand, but this is a great device.', ""Over the years I have used a variety of pointer devices, but I have returned to using a trackball for my main computer after a number of  years lay-off as the RSI was threatening to re-appear again.The (wired) trackball is solid and larger than a normal mouse. You won't want to be travelling with this regularly, or putting it on a small surface. It doesn't go anywhere if accidentally knocked. The buttons seems solid and positive (although see the scroll wheel section below). The device plugged in without issues or additional software requried on a Windows 10 laptop. The surface is comfortable and supports a relaxed open hand. For my average man sized hands the primary buttons and the roller ball are in a good position.I'm less sure about the smaller forward/back buttons just in front of the ball. I'm not in the habit of using these on mice normally, but the ones on the trackball seem awkwardly positioned. Too far to the left of the primary button makes it a vaguely uncomfortable stretch for the back button with my index finger, and I have to actively move my hand position to hit the forward button. My thumb is too short to use them.The ball s heavy but spins freely and still I get a childish sense of fun spinning it sideways with the ball of my thumb to send the pointer right across the screen. I did notice that after a number of months it got gritty and slowed down, but popping the ball out (there is a hole underneath which fits a pencil or end of a little finger to aid this) and cleaning it, and particularly the sensors, of hand gank sorted this out. I now pop the ball out weekly for a clean out of fluff, if nothing else it gives a similar satisfaction similar to popping bubble wrap.I use the central scroll wheel quite heavily. It has a bumpy, indexed, flow, like most scroll wheels. The scroll is a rubber tyre on a metal wheel and after about 6 months this started to slip. As I felt this was probably in warranty I contacted perrix (initially through Amazon, but then passed through to their website). After filling in a simple form with the details of the problem they quickly organised a replacement direct from Amazon. I suspect that when I get round to taking apart the old mouse a careful application of glue will fix the slipping tyre problem. I haven't seen other reviews with this problem so it may just be an occasional QC issue.Perrix did ask me to write a review at the end of the replacement process. It was not contingent on it nor was I promised anything else, it has taken me a number of weeks to get round to it and the new trackball has been in use all that time. However, as the replacement process was good, and I like the product, I have honoured the request.It is not a perfect device. Leaving aside the scroll wheel it's a generally positive experience, but the auxially buttons are a bit far apart, and those with smaller hands would find them more problematic. The primary buttons are large and would cope with shorter fingers, but you would might have to use more of your thumb tip (rather than ball, or pad) on the ball with smaller hands. For those with average sized hands I don't think you can wrong at this price and it compares favourably with my big name brand from a number of years ago."", ""I treated myself to a gaming laptop as my 10 year old gaming PC just wasn't cutting it anymore. Having used a gaming mouse for those ten years I just couldn't get used to the track pad on the laptop. As my other half told me to move my desk out to the shed I am now relegated to gaming on the couch. Obviously a normal mouse wouldn't suit my needs so i decided to go for this rollerball mouse. and I'm very glad I did. It takes a bit of getting used to, lost count of the amount of times I tried to move the mouse instead of using the roller ball. Now i have been using it for a couple of days I'm very happy with it. I bought the Bluetooth version which cost me £35, the good thing is you don't need a dongle, so you're not using up a usb slot, which is great because laptops don't come with many. I put the batteries in, turned it on, held the button until my laptop detected it, and that was it. Easy peasy. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't have a lot of space. Good well built bit of kit."", ""This review is for the wired version.  I hated to give up on my wireless Logitech MX Ergo, but much prefer the responsiveness of this wired Perixx trackball.  Also, there is no driver (software) to download.  Just plug it in, and it's working.  Select the cursor speed with the DPI switch, then fine tune it with your computer's mouse setting.  Done.  The buttons are NOT programmable, so if you need this, look elsewhere.  Also, as noted by some other reviews, the ball may be a bit stiff to roll at first.  However, it does completely smooth out after a couple of weeks of break-in.""]"

I began exploring vertical mice a few years ago and, as I'm left-handed, the field of contenders was pretty small.I first tried the only offering from the BigBrand mouse company.  It eased the pain, but that mouse is a very poor match for my left hand: it seems hard to grip, awkward to maneuver, and my thumb can't reach either of the thumb buttons.  Also, the BigBrand vertical mouse is way too expensive.Then I found the Perimice-713L from Perixx, a company unfamiliar to me.  This mouse feels just right in my hand, it points, clicks, and tracks exactly as it ought, and the price is about one-third of BigBrand's.I've used the 713-L with three variants of Linux (Kubuntu, Fedora, Debian) with no difficulties at all.  In fact, I've got just one suggested improvement, and it's quite minor.  There's a switch that selects one of three DPI levels; I wish there were an LED that signals which level is currently selected.Would I buy another one?  I already have:  I've now got three of these Perixx mice, one at each of three different locations.Try to find a way to handle a vertical mouse before you buy one.  The BigBrand mouse is good, in most respects, but it's plain uncomfortable for me in daily usage.

But that's where the single star comes in. To record Macros becomes a task you are left to do on your own. Worst piece of instructions, it's more an advertisement for a a Cooler Master. Bought this with a Razer and compared. The Razer to me is a more complete platform from build to programming compared to this. This piece of plastic is now really an orthogonal split keyboard for me. Truly disappointed. Customer service when asked for assistance sends their advertisement instead. I now recall why I never went with a Cooler Master products. I know there are the followers so please don't hate me. This is my personal and frustrating experience."", ""Just got this product today and used it extensively with a game.I'll be strictly talking about the things I intended to use it for, which is key binds and macros.But to get a couple of things out of the way that don't have to do with the above:- The magnet is no good on this for the wrist rest. The magnet cannot even hold the wrist rest in mid-air (which is very light) when attached to the controlpad. If you attempt to move the control pad in any direction, the wrist rest just stays put because of the weak magnet.The wrist pad itself feels nice however.- The materials used for the control pad seem to be cheap. The enclosure seems to be plastic. For the price I would have thought it was made of all metal/aluminum, but it is not.It does however, have a very clean look and fits in well with my SteelSeries Apex Pro Keyboard.- Not sure if intended, but both the wrist rest and the control pad are very different colors. They each appear to have what looks like to be a brushed alumunium top. One is black, one is gray.Aesthetically, that's not great, I would love all just one color.The software:It's called 'Master Plus'.It only opens if you have the device connected, otherwise, it will prompt a message saying you need to connect a compatible device or otherwise exit the program.Never maximize the program. If you do, it will appear as nothing is working. When trying to click any of the sub-menus for the controlpad to create macros, keymap, change profiles, etc, it will act as if it's not responding visually, but when you minimize it, it will be in the sub-menu you clicked beforehand.I can't resize the program window. There's a lot of wasted space, you'd think it would dynamically scale down if you try to re-size, but it doesn't even let you do that. Along with the previous issue about maximizing the program, you'll have to move the window down, which will obfuscate options/info at the bottom of the program.Not sure why I have to make a macro for 2 keys. (EX: CTRL Q). Most software I've used for keybinds, for instance my mouse, allow me to put 2 keys easily. In this case, I'd have to make a macro which then I have to give more info about the delay, when really I want this to just press 2 keys in that order.I don't know what's up with 'Simple' and 'Advanced' mode. There have essentially the same options except maybe 2 (disable and clear key assignment). Simple by far is the best mode to do things in. Simple has way more information and options that it almost seems like they labeled it wrong.In summary, there are a lot of issues with software. Some issues with the hardware.Those software bugs need to fixed and the UI needs updating.Creation of macros is easy and intuitive, assigning them out to specific keys is even easier. Key mapping could use some work. Profiles are a mess, not sure which are on-board vs local. Can't delete extra profiles not in use.But in the end it does exactly what I need it to do with a lot of hassle. I imagine in time, the software will get better, the hassle to do things will go down."", 'I am a left-handed graphic designer and have used a lot of one-handed keyboards.The N52te, Delux\'s one-handed keyboard, Koolertron\'s 24-key, 48-key keyboard, and more. I found out that the control pad completed Kickstarter and sold it to Amazon. It was difficult to wait, not knowing when to release in our country, so I ordered two for use at home and at work.The biggest advantage is that it has onboard memory. It was a product that I received and modified a lot of feedback from Kickstarter, so I had the application and everything was fine. The product finish is also great. The hand rest can be completely detached, which is very good for freeing up work space.There are areas that need improvement or are disappointing.1. The key combinations that can be set in double action are too limited. Only a single key can be set to double. Keys like Ctrl + A and Ctrl + X for example cannot be assigned as double keys.2. In the macro setting, the keystroke list UI is stuffy. You cannot select multiple. When writing macro scenarios, you often have to go through a lot of trial and error to erase the wrong keystrokes. However, you cannot select multiple items, so you have to delete them one by one to confirm the Yes/No message box. Step up, Step down also allows you to select only one list, so when you actually work, you have to edit the list with a lot of clicks. It\'s incredibly tiring... it should have the drag-select, drag-move and multi-select features common in Windows Explorer.3. The delay setting in the macro setting is too bad.There is only a delay for keystrokes and no individual simple delays. When creating macros, it is unintuitive and very inconvenient. A simple delay without input is essential because there is a network delay and the amount of time the UI is displayed in the game or application.There should be a function to list simple delays without keystrokes in seconds or milliseconds.4. It is difficult to know which indicator was selected in the LED indicator color setting UI. When I first set it up, I was mistaken because I thought it had no function. It would be nice if the selected display icon was distinguished by a graphic. For example, the selected LED indicator is outlined by the indicator icon.5. Limiting the number of profiles to be used is required. When the profile cycle key is set, 1 to 24 are recognized. That means it cycles from 1 to 24. So, when specifying a circular key, you need to set two plus and minus keys. There are other ways, but you have to manually set the following profile numbers for each profile. Once you can limit the number of profiles to use, you can quickly cycle through only one part of the scroll keys. Otherwise, you need the ability to specify a range of the number of profiles to which the cycle key will be applied.6. Profile import/export is a bit strange. Except for the indicator, other LED settings cannot be saved. There is no function like saving all profiles as one file. You need to save and load the number of individual profiles you set. There is a function called ""Import all profiles"", but I don\'t know how to use it. I have tried saving multiple files, numbering files and testing, but it keeps failing.7. Key input is very sensitive. There are times when the key is pressed even when the weight is slightly placed on the keycap. I think it was made so sensitive because of the dual action or the aim pad. There should be an option to control the overall key pressure.8. It is also true that the magnet has weak hand rest and the distance of the wheel is inconvenient to use. It would be nice to change the wheel position design in the sequel. The height and distance should be closer to the keycap. It would be better to change the position of the LED indicator and wheel.What I wrote down as a problem above is a feature that exists by default in most other products. If only the problem I mentioned changes, it would be a really good one-handed keyboard.', 'I\'m not a gamer. I got this to use at work as my job requires repetitive mouse tasks. I had the Razer Nostromo before, which needed Synapse software to function at all. I used the Razer successfully for years until IT stepped up security and won\'t allow any software on our PC. ControlPad has on-board memory, and although it\'s not advertised anywhere, it does NOT need software to work- only to PROGRAM it. So this was my only choice.The ControlPad design isn\'t comfortable. It doesn\'t contour to your hand like Razer\'s, which has a raised center allowing your palm to pivot so you can hit keys effortlessly. Razer\'s design also allows you to use your thumb on the joystick, and has a scroll wheel within finger\'s reach. ControlPad has 2 scrollwheels at the top, which are an awkward stretch to reach and basically useless for that reason. The molding around the scroll wheels has sharp edges and shows a lack of attention to detail. Controlpad is like a standard numberpad, but larger.The keys have a nice feel but I have no need for mechanical or pressure-sensitive switches. Advertising it as ""brushed aluminum"" is frankly absurd because only the top faceplate is metal. The sides, bottom and palm rest are all cheap plastic. The palm rest is poorly designed; the magnet is too weak to hold it in position. Why couldn\'t they just have a little catch to hold it in place? The result is you\'re always fidgeting with it. All that being said, it\'s still a good product. But unless you *NEED* on-board memory, I would get the Razer Nostromo/Orbweaver over this.', 'can only fit about 3 profiles max worth of macros', 'I bought this control pad for playing flight games. So far in Elite Dangerous I have had a lot of fun using it.To anyone who thinks theirs is defective because it constantly needs to be recalibrated, please listen to me. The pad uses infrared to detect analog input, check if you have placed your control pad next to a window, sunlight will affect the infrared sensor, if you calibration was done at night then you most likely will lose that during the day.I end up always closing my blinds when using this device, so far I have not had the need to recalibrate for weeks.One thing this device need to improve is the jitter problem. I used a few keys to mimic a joystick input and the pad had no problem detecting minimum and maximum input for different axis. However, if you want to push in a key 10% and hold it there you will notice the input is “shaking” around the 10% despite your finger doesn’t have any movement. This translates into the game very clearly, in my case I wanted to apply 10% forward throttle but in game my movement is not a smooth 10% forward but rather the forward throttle brakes and goes around the 10% due to the jitter induced by the sensor. Luckily, I haven’t had the need to do much low speed precision flying so it didn’t bother me much. I wish the manufacturers could look into this issue.', ""I loved the Logitech G13 and used it for years. Then I tried the Orbweaver which was also great. However, this CoolerMaster Control pad tops them all.Some products are so obtuse they require googling just to figure out how to do the simplest thing. This device/software is just the opposite. I never had to consult a manual to assign characters or numbers to any of the 24 keys. Further it was a snap to program key combo macros for any key, with delays between keystrokes if necessary. The nice touch is you can color code each key, for example, I used blue to indicate spells, green to indicate movement, purple for macros, etc. Of-course these keystrokes work on muscle memory so the lighting color on the key is just a nice esthetic touch.It was also a snap to create different key layouts. I had two key layouts for SWTOR and another for Black Desert. There is a roller switch at the top of the device to switch from one keypad layout to another and 4 LEDS which glow according to the color you assigned for that particular layout/game.As far as tactile feel of the keys all I can say is I like the touch very much. You can buy custom key caps which is a nice option. I decided to get a key cap set just so I could 'engrave' the 08/W key so my fingers knew exactly where they were positioned.Finally, I have never encountered a software or keypad bug. It all just works."", ""Granted, if you get a broken device shipped that's disappointing. Otherwise it's REALLY good considering the price. Yes it's cheaply made. No the software isn't a smooth experience like Razer. But it's functionality is elaborate, right down to the dual action function. Build is comparable to my Tartarus."", ""I got this two days ago and haven't fully reviewed it's features but I like it... with one mechanical exception: the magnetic attraction between the ControlPad and the wrist rest is pathetically weak. Far weaker than a refrigerator magnet, the units will separate at the slightest nudge. The wrist rest is virtually useless as is.I fixed the problem by using adhesive backed magnetic tape. See my photos. I put a strip on the ControlPad and a strip on the wrist rest. The fix does not alter or damage either unit in the slightest. But now the units stick together magnetically and still can easily be separated if so desired.CoolerMaster should fix this in the future by using stronger internal magnets."", ""Got this because I wanted a macro keyboard, with lots of keys, that didn't need software running on the computer to use it.  You have to run their software to record the macros, but then you can use the keypad and those macros on any other computer.  Need that so can use it on work computers, where running that software's not a good idea.  Really well made.  Would like if the software allowed more complicated macros than it does, but it works.  Lots of RGB options, very pretty, but didn't get it for that.""]"

Was ready to splurge on SteerMouse app in case the Elecom app was sup-par, but I found it good enough for the functions that I required.Coming from a Logitech MX Master 3, there isn\'t anything that I miss thus far.', 'Suite à une légère tendinite (probablement davantage lié à du jeu vidéo avec manette mais passons), et étant déjà détenteur d\'une Kensington Slimblade au travail, j\'ai décidé de m\'acheter une trackball pour mon PC personnel et télétravail. Après avoir longuement hésité entre une souris verticale, une autre Kensington (Expert pour varier) et cette Elecom, j\'ai finalement décidé de commander cette Elecom Deft Pro qui avait un prix plutôt bas (d\'ailleurs je ne comprends pas la différence avec l\'autre page du même produit beaucoup plus chère, est-ce une version plus ancienne du même modèle ?)  et qui me paraissait le changement le plus ""fun"" à mon goût.A la réception du produit, j\'ai eu la surprise de découvrir un article qui devait avoir traîné très longtemps dans les hangars vu que la pile était déjà en décomposition (cf. la poudre blanche sur la troisième photo) et avait couvert le paquet de ses résidus poudreux. Etant donné que je ne compte pas l\'utiliser sans fil (quel intérêt d\'ailleurs ? à moins d\'occasionnellement la transporter sur le canapé, le but d\'une trackball étant de ne pas bouger le bras, le fil n\'est pas un problème et on économise des piles) et que je n\'avais pas que ça à faire de retourner le produit, je l\'ai gardée en l\'état et malgré cela il n\'y a eu aucun problème sur le reste.Au delà de ce petit ""incident"", même si je n\'utilise que le mode filaire, le fait que cette trackball propose plusieurs modes ET qu\'elle prenne en charges tous les modes (avec ou sans fil) ET avec un câble détachable est un énorme point positif. Chez Kensington, c\'est soit avec fil non détachable, soit sans fil (du moins sur les modèles que j\'ai vus), or le modèle Expert sans fil semble mieux fini que le filaire : on est donc obligé de sacrifier quelque chose selon notre choix, ce qui n\'est pas le cas sur cette Elecom. C\'est d\'ailleurs ce qui a aussi contribué à éliminer la Kensington Expert de mes choix d\'achat.Parlons maintenant de finition. A ce niveau, je dirais que c\'est inégal. Globalement, en face, elle a une bonne figure. Sur le dessous et au roulement de la boule (je reviendrai dessus en comparant avec la Kensington Slimblade), on sent que c\'est un peu plus mitigé. Heureusement, les différents boutons semblent de qualité dans leur mécanisme (la boîte parle d\'un partenariat avec Omron, l\'avenir nous dira si ça signifie une meilleure durabilité ou pas) et toute la face sur laquelle repose la main est plaisante. C\'est plutôt le reste des plastiques qui font un peu plus cheap.Pour parler du plus important, à savoir la maniabilité, je dirais que dans l\'ensemble ça se passe plutôt bien. Habitué à la Kensington Slimblade et de sa fonctionnalité exclusive qui tue (le scroll avec la boule qui est imbattable), j\'ai eu besoin d\'un temps d\'adaptation pour m\'habituer à scroller avec une roue classique de souris. Globalement, j\'étais d\'ailleurs assez gauche au début et par rapport à mon premier contact avec une Kensington (Orbit), j\'ai trouvé le premier contact moins naturel sur cette Elecom (alors que j\'étais très à l\'aise avec l\'Orbit tout de suite). Rassure-vous cependant, cela n\'a duré que quelques jours...mais pour arriver à ce résultat j\'ai quand même dû passer par le logiciel Elecom (trouvable sur le site) pour associer les boutons à des actions. En effet, LE point noir du mappage d\'origine à mon avis ets le clic droit qui est trop proche de la boule et difficile d\'accès. Il y a un autre bouton juste à côté (Fn2) qui tombe juste sous ce doigt. J\'ai donc associé le clic droit à Fn2 et cela a enfin rendu cette trackball plus intuitive.Au delà des assignations de boutons, la position sur cette trackball semble plus axée jeu vidéo ou autre (pro ?) avec son profil général et ses boutons disponibles alors que la Kensington Slimblade est à mon avis plus adaptée au travail de bureau ""classique"" (internet, etc.). La prise en main est plus décontractée sur la Kensington avec un placement qui peut varier. la fluidité supérieure de sa boule la rend plus facile à utiliser en effleurant  et le scroll via la boule fait qu\'on peut naviguer avec deux doigts sans avoir la main posée ""sérieusement"" posée sur le dispositif. Sur la Elecom, on doit bien la prendre en main comme un gamer prêt à dégainer même si on peut quand même un peu soulever la main et toucher les trois contrôles principaux (pas besoin d\'être totalement tendu quand même, juste davantage que sur la Kensington). J\'ai d\'ailleurs évoqué la boule, et il faut noter que celle de la Deft pro est plus petite que la Slmblade donc elle demande de davantage la bouger sur un écran à haute définition (j\'ai un UWQHD, alors imaginez sur un 4k) et de plus les roulements semblent moins fluides que sur la Kensington qui roule comme du beurre. On s\'y habitue, mais en se focalisant on le remarque quand même.Si je devais tout de même retenir un point supérieur, ce sont les boutons de au dessus du clic gauche plus accessibles que sur la Kensington si vous n\'avez pas de très grandes mains.Pour finir sur l\'ergonomie, je vais terminer sur deux points.D\'abord sur le logiciel, je trouve celui d\'Elecom très en retard sur celui de Kensington qui a été mis à jour. II est beaucoup plus austère et rien que changer le langage en anglais au lieu du japonais au début n\'est pas ultra clair. Le logiciel est plus austère et ne propose pas une très bonne fonction de la Kensington : l\'accélération du pointeur (ou alors je n\'ai pas trouvé).  Ce n\'est pas très grave sachant que je m\'en moque un peu, mais si cela rentre dans vos critère,s le logicile Elecom reste plus austère et vieillot. Il marche parfaitement pour assigner des touches cependant, c\'est le principal.Enfin, comme vous le voyez sur ma première image, j\'ai personnellement acheté un repose poigner Kensington parce que je trouvais que la prise en main était encore plus fatigante qu\'une souris dans la configuration d\'origine). En effet, le poigner repose sur la table dure et cela coupe la circulation en plus d\'appuyer. Avec le repose poignet, c\'est nickel. je suppose que cela dépend de plein de critères perosnnels donc je ne vais pas tirer de conclusions universelles dessus, mais à ce niveau là la Kensington Slimblade est bien plus agréable à l\'utilisation. Même comparé à la Elecom avec le repose-poignets, je la trouve lus reposante.En conclusion, même si cela ne ressort pas forcément du comparatif, cette trackball reste quand même pas mal, mais plus pour le jeu vidéo que pour la bureautique. En effet, la prise en mains est plutôt fatigante et même avec une souris, hormis le déplacement qui ne m\'affecte pas, je suis davantage reposé. En jeu vidéo par contre, c\'est plutôt bien mais la fluidité supérieure de Kensington (vs la boule qui accroche très légèrement sur cette Elecom) serait peut-être plus avantageuse pour les joueurs compétitifs (je suis un joueur occasionnel donc je m\'en moque). Pour toutes ces raisons, je lui mets 4, mais si c\'est votre première trackball j\'imagine que vous ne serez pas parasité par une comparaison à ce qui est mieux chez d\'autres (qui ne sont pas parfaits non plus, mais pour ma part je mets 5/5 à la Slimblade pour sa fluidité et son scrolling sur la boule, 4/5 à celle-ci). De plus, la gestion avec OU sans fil est quand même un effort que l\'on doit saluer d\'Elecom (même si pour ma part je ne vois pas l\'intérêt du sans fil sur une trackball, surtout de cette taille).', 'ホイール操作の一発目が反応しない逆に動くしかしながら、軽い操作感と確実なボタン操作で作業性は抜群！肩も凝らないしおすすめの商品！！', 'I\'ve had three of the Elecom trackballs, the smaller, wireless grey ball one, the HUGE and this one the Deft Pro.I sent the smaller one with the grey ball back as the static friction was so bad as to make it a nightmare to do any kind of fine pointer work with.Next up was the HUGE, same deal, horrible bearings, way too much static friction but shape of the trackball wasn\'t right for my hands. I did a bearing mod with it which made the static friction almost ok but still wasn\'t happy with it (looks like it should be perfect for big hands but oddly wasn\'t).I usually use a Kensington Slim Blade which is THE GOLD STANDARD of modern trackballs. Nothing comes close to this for low static friction and I mean nothing unless you\'re going to get the old skool and hard to find roller bearing balls like the CST or the DT255. Sadly the Kensington isn\'t quite right for gaming which is why I wanted the Elecoms. i.e. it has a proper scroll wheel as opposed to the slimblade which detects a rotation of the ball itself for scroll which issues false positives in some situations, like gaming... yes I use trackballs for gaming :)I thought I\'d give Elecom a third chance. The ball itself is slightly smaller then the huge but is still big rnough to be precise. The size / curve of the ergonomic shell, I find to be better that the HUGE and there\'s the added advantage this this works with wireless dongle, bluetooth and wired connections so I can use it via USB on all my computers and also use it with my phone or iPad etc. Great.I believe there\'s software for configuring the buttons on Windows, I am using a Mac and have paid for SteerMouse which is cheap enough and allows for very useful things like button macros etc and profiles per device, as well as turning off pointer acceleration which is ESSENTIAL for playing FPS etc on Mac. I can\'t advise getting that software enough. It\'s Apple Silicon M1 native too.The combination of the Elecom and SteerMouse has been almost perfect for me playing on the Mac sadly the trackball, out of the box, is let down by the synthetic ruby bearings, again. I don\'t know why no other company than Kensington can\'t get the ruby rollers right (even non slimblade Kensingtons don\'t seem to be there). So... rather than send this back again I decided to void the warranty and take it apart. It\'s a fiddly job, took me about 20 minutes to strip is down to the point where I could replace the ruby bearings with zirconium ones. If you\'re going to do this make sure to wait for long enough to decide you\'re definitely happy with the trackball as you can\'t return the item once you\'ve done this.However, IMHO, this trackball is unusable for fine pointer work without this mod. You can find 2.5mm zirconium ceramic bearings on eBay and places like that, they\'re not that expensive and come in small packs. They\'re the same size as the ones needed for the Elecom HUGE if you\'re in any doubt.I can\'t stress enough how much of a difference replacing the bearings makes. It\'s made such a difference. For example, if you\'re trying to do fine aiming in an FPS of you need to move pixel by pixel (say you\'re selecting from small text) you\'ll know what I am talking about, the ball ""sticks"" then releases when the force becomes enough to over come the friction which means the pointer makes a small jump.There is still some static friction after the bearing modification, more than the SlimBlade of out of the box but it\'s reduced enough to not not too big a problem any more and for that reason and that reason alone I am keeping the Deft Pro as every other aspect of this trackball is great. There\'s 8 independent click / function buttons (including the scroll wheel click) all easily accessible. There\'s a hardware DPI switch for setting to lower or higher DPI which is great. If you use SteerMouse on the mac you\'ll have total control over the button mappings and sensitivity.I have no idea why Elecom do not ship there with proper bearings from the factory. It\'s worth noting that the Kensington Slimblade uses a different type of plastic to seat the bearings in which seems to be much smoother than the standard plastic used by all other trackball manufacturers for the bearing cups.Anyway. Yes. This trackball is amazingly good value for money given the buttons, ergonomics, size. It\'s perfect... IF you\'re happy modding the bearings. If you\'re not you\'re going to be constantly pulling the ball out to clear the bearings and getting annoyed if you need to do any small, fine pointer work.Again these are my opinions. I own and have owned a wide variety of trackballs. I still have a couple of CSTs, a Kensington Slimblade and the mythical DT255, and a Perixx PERIMICE-720 (which I think is excellent out of the box, but it\'s a thumb ball which is useless to be for gaming etc however has little static friction) as well as having owned most of the other Elecoms.Please note there doesn\'t seem to be a YouTube teardown video for this trackball if you do want to replace the bearings. You\'re going to need a small torx drive, small philips screwdriver, 2.5mm zirconium bearings. The screws are hidden under the rubber feet of the trackball and the paper with the serial number / device info pronted on it. Once all the torx screws are out you can get the lid off (just go round with your nails or a guitar pick to pop it open). you then need to pop out the trackball cup (it\'s got two clips attaching it to the base of the unit on the left hand side and a bigger one on the right hand side). Once it\'s unclipped you can remove the cup without having to decouple any of the ribbon cables, however you\'re going to have to unscrew and detach the optical tracking unit to get to the final screw keeping the trackball cup halves together. When the screws are out VERY SLOWLY AND VERY CAREFULLY part the two halves of the ball cup apart, as soon as they are apart the small bearings will drop out if knocked. Replace them with the new ones and very slowly and carefully put the two halves back together then reassemble the unit in reverse order as above. Like I say it\'s about a 20 minute job.

The mini has only 2 usb ports and I did not want to use them for a keyboard and mouse, needing, at minimum, an external hard drive.  The Perixx keyboard served its' purpose, that is, I was able to use it to set up the server, but would not want to use it on a daily basis.  The trackball, while functional, is awkwardly placed and the dpi setting were too sensitive for the screen size I used (with the mini).  That said, they would probably work better on a full sized monitor, but even if they did, the awkward placement would not be comfortable/ convenient enough for me to use on my primary.  It is not a terrible choice if you have only 1 usb port to spare."", ""Works good, better than expected actually. Bought this item because I needed a usb keyboard and mouse so I could get into my bios / ueif menu, because Bluetooth doesn't load until windows does.I like that it is a keyboard and mouse together off of one usb port, and as a bonus it also has 2 more usb ports on the keyboard which do work, i have used them with thumb drives because i didn't want to reach down to my tower to plug it in.I haven't had issues with the ball mouse yet BUT I also make sure to keep hair and gunk off of my finger while using the mouse ball.Only thing I would have liked to see different would be some kind of cap that could be removed to take out the ball to clean the ball and the roller points inside, just guessing on that because I do not believe there is a way to take out the ball without taking apart the keyboard.It could be that the ball pops out to clean insides the mouse area, but I did not want to force it and break the keyboard, the ball is in there good. I do know that shaking the keyboard upside down does not make the ball come out. In my opinion that is a good thing because I have dropped the keyboard and the ball stayed in place, I would hate to lose it being the size of a marble."", ""I actually got this to use on my windows PC and due to the explicit OS listing I didn't expect it to work on my Linux Mint 21. Tried it for a test and found it seems to work completely. trackball is smooth, keys feel full sized.  It is pretty compact as a keyboard, but typing is very comfortable when typing with clean keys.  I really like the solid but not harsh bottom of the key press. Easy to type quickly with no doubling or lost characters.  Windows key pops up the Mint Menu just like on windows.  Audio volume function keys work normally. I would definitely buy it again."", '5 stars because the keys are standard size and you can actually type whole sentences without mistakes. However, I don\'t recommend this.This trackball sends you back in time. Having to move the trackball to move the pointer and then having to click either the left or right button... it makes you angry because you can do all of that in just one motion on any modern laptop trackpad, saving time. But with this, you get sent back to 1997. Another downside is that the trackball is not ""tacky"" or whatever the word would be. For example, if you\'ve ever tried the red trackball in a Lenovo laptop, the pointer doesn\'t move too fast and you\'re more likely to put the pointer on exactly where you want to click on the screen. However, with this trackball, you will ALWAYS miss the target and have to slide it around back and forth until you get the pointer right where you want it. Last, a red laser light emanates from below the trackball and if you have sensitivities to certain light spectrums (blue light, red light, etc) your finger will hurt when you use the trackball.Overall, this keyboard didn\'t work out for me.', 'Like this brand, well built feels solid. Only issue is I get a warning that pops up when I plug it into my mac mini that the usb device is drawing to much power. I am not sure why, but it still works great.', ""This is a great compact keybaord! I'm on my computer all day long with work and emails and can be very hard on keyboards.  When my last keyboard started to give out, I chose this Perixx Compact with a trackball.  The placement of the keys perfectly suits my preferences.  I work with numbers often and some keyboards have a number lock feature without a lighted indicator.  This Perixx has a very bright num-caps-scroll lock indicator.  The shortcoming for me is that the num-lock is automatic or at least I haven't located any command button to turn it to engage or disengage number lock.  The problem is that my company laptop has several layers of encryption and keyboard numbers are recognized until my the computer startup is completely launched.  I can get around this but definitely a drawback of this keyboard.  The trackball is a nice little feature and I really like the location of it because this keyboard trackball is only for backup or secondary use.  A standard external mouse is preferred for primary use with this keyboard.  The big plus for this compact keyboard is that it has 2 USB ports.  They are positioned very closed to one another.  Also again, if I choose to use ione of the 2 keybaord USB ports for the USB receiver for an external mouse, the external mouse will only be recognized after my computer startup has completely launched.  Since this keyboard is for home use for me, I don't mind that keystrokes are very noisy.  In  a setting with other people, the sound would be very annoying.  Overall, it's a great compact keyboard at an affordable price."", ""Several keys of my laptop keyboard are going out, so I decided to give this keyboard a try, since in included the trackball (so I wouldn't have to be going between keyboards). The size of the keyboard was great, and, considering that I've become accustomed to laptop keyboards, it didn't seem distressingly compact. The keyboard itself is membrane, but, again, being accustomed to chicklet keys and laptop membrane keyboards, it didn't bother me. The trackball, however, is torturous. Having transitioned from a physical mouse to a trackpad, I'll admit that I hadn't any experience with a trackball before- and now I know why. The trackball on this keyboard is not only imprecise but the placement of the right- and left-click buttons in relation to the trackball itself required an odd, unergonomic hand movement when using the trackball with your thumb; moreover, if you try to move your thumb to click one of the buttons, it will invariably trigger the trackball to move the cursor, thus causing a decent amount of frustration. If you can deal with this issue, the rest of it is pretty good for the price."", ""OK, so I am loving this keyboard in most ways.  I love the dedicated numeric keypad, helpful as I test screen readers.  I am typically a keyboard-oriented user, and the typing feel is definite, without mushiness.  But the design of the trackball does pose challenges.  I am not a big fan of trackball on the right, buttons on the left, but the placement of the right and left buttons is problematic, as others note.  I am mostly wrapping my hand around the right corner and moving the ball with my thumb and pressing the left mouse button with my forefinger.  The trackball isn't as sensitive as some others have commented, but the manufacturer may have responded to feedback.  That wraparound technique is probably only manageable for someone with smaller hands, and it might not be manageable if the keyboard is in a drawer for rack-mounted systems, etc..  If I had larger hands, I could cup my hand over the numeric keypad and press the left mouse button with my forefinger and roll the ball with my middle finger.  Overall, though, this keyboard is going to work best for people who aren't using a pointing device a lot.  That being said, I like it better than the Adesso it's replacing.  Kudos, too, for including an Applications key, when many keyboards omit them, which is hard on assistive technology users."", 'For working from home, I needed a keyboard that occupied as little space as possible in my desk while not making the keys smaller to achieve it. Small keys might be fine for a coffee table keyboard connected to a smart TV, but not for 8hr / day use. This is the perfect keyboard in that regard: no numeric keypad, no unnecessary spacing, the keys are regular sized so it\'s comfortable to type on (I took a photo to show).It\'s also thin enough, which is good for ergonomics. And I also like very much that the Ctrl key is in the corner (instead of placing Fn in the corner like some sadistic keyboard designers do).As other reviewers have mentioned, they trackball it includes is way too sensitive for being used. When I bought it I thought to myself I\'d give it a try and maybe try to configure it via the appropriate driver. Well, no special driver for ChromeOS, and the OS doesn\'t let you adjust the sensitivity on a per-device basis. But for me a usable trackball would have been just an extra delight (""I can also take the mouse off the desk!"").Speaking of the mouse, the keyboard includes USB ports; it\'s practical to connect your mouse to it if you\'re going to be then connecting and disconnecting them both to your laptop repeatedly like me.I\'ve been using it for a few months now and I\'m very happy with it. Glad I bought it.', ""well, the keys sound good but are a wee bit mushy. At that price point acceptable, although I've had similarly priced keyboards with firmer keys.""]"

I have zero complaints except for the ""classic"" vs ""standard"" bottom row compatibility. Going off of model numbers alone, K70 should mean K70, but it doesn\'t. My K70 Rapidfire has the ""classic"" bottom row, and thus the two Windows, spacebar, and menu keys cannot be swapped out. Why Corsair doesn\'t offer these few keys from older models/layouts as a separate mod kit is beyond me, since LITERALLY every other key fits without issue. I\'ll live with it because the price of the other kit is over 3x more than I paid (for an open box item), but it\'s a frustrating compromise with an otherwise quality kit.', 'Some reviewers note that these keycaps don\'t fit their keyboards, but that is obviously very situational since they fit mine (Razer BlackWidow Mini) perfectly for the keys which are of standard size (BW has some which are not). As long as your switches are Cherry standard or thereabout in terms of upper part of the switch (the part into which the keycap slides), you\'ll be fine. However, I found out that these caps are not perfect for Razer\'s optical switches (e.g. on Huntsman V2) since - due to their thick sidewalls and wide switch base they tend to stick while pressed down occasionally.Some pros and cons:PROS- Really thick overall. This makes them more sound-dampening than your average keycaps (e.g. they are better than Hyperx\'s pudding keycaps in terms of sound dampening and produce lower pitch noises). BlackWidow with green (clicky) switches sounds much much nicer with these instead of Razer\'s doubleshot ABS ones.- They come with silicone dampeners which additionally reduce high-pitch noises when typing and at the same time don\'t make typing experience too mushy- Large letter cutouts which let the light pass through them better than any other PBT keycap I\'ve seen so far. They are on par with ABS keycaps in this which is quite a feat on its own (photo shows Razer doubleshot ABS vs these).- Surface is quite textured and slightly rough, more so then Razer\'s keycaps. I love it, others might not.CONS- Well, the letters are a bit thicker which might bother you or not (personal preference). They are less ""elegant"" than Razer\'s own default fonts but, as said in pros, they let much more light through which is a plus for me- some have noted fairly thin stems. This might be a problem in the long term but I\'ve had no issues so far (only had them for a month though).CONCLUSIONI\'m getting more of these (probably will get red and maybe blacks as well) to replace Razer\'s PBT\'s.', ""Though the keys technically fit fine on my 65% akko 3068b, I can't use only the keycaps from this set to map out my keyboard.

I'm assuming that works fine for 100% boards, but on my board, the layout means that it looks silly.The keys feel nice texturally, but they are a little clacky. The o-rings change the sound, but then keys feel a little soggy when typing. Def not a choky sound with or without the o-rings.The shine through looks nice. They definitely feel and sound better than other shine through sets I've purchased.Overall, because of the feel and sound, I can't and won't be using only these keycaps on my board."", 'These are as advertised; however, read carefully as not ALL keys will fit.I have a Corsair K70LUX RGB, almost all keys fit excluding the space bar and the windows keys (see photos).Otherwise, they seem off high quality (OEM) and add some flair compared to the factory keys.Mine seemed to pop off easily and some got damaged (original caps), this is the reason for replacement.Won’t know how they are until months from now with some usage.If your board is in good condition, this may be worth it but for $30 may be worth putting towards a new keyboard.']"

This does not have a plate which you need since these stabs are plate mounted also these stabs are quite bad among the worst a cheap replacement is the Durock Plate Mount Stabilizers in canada you can buy this from Mino Keys the plate any of the work very well so its whatever, you should not use cherry profile switches as it interferes with one of the rows, the last thing is the rgb is very bright and adjusting it is quite hard in the QMMK app also this layout is a bit weird with a extra windows and a weird alt keys plus a weird fn key which you can remap in the GMMK app.', ""This thing is a work of art. It has a great sound profile - especially when you consider the body is 'plastic'. I tried the aluminum and copper plates. I ended up keeping the copper one and sending back the other.I tried many different switches (black ink, halo true, royal clear) and ended up keeping the gateron milky yellows in the board. If you're getting this keyboard for RGB, you'll notice any switch that doesn't use a clear top housing will cut the brightness by at least 25%. This isn't a problem for me because I often turn the switch RGBs off and use just the underglow RGB lighting.You'll notice in the photos I added two foam layers from stupidfish designs. While not at all necessary, I do recommend the foam below the PCB. The layer between the PCB and plate will depend on the sound profile you're going for and the switches you're using.I really hate to sound like an elitist, but the stabilizers that are included are not good. I upgraded them with durock plate-mounted stabilizers and the only issue I had was the right side stabilizer on the space bar having an annoying rattle. After a bunch of tuning, the trick that ended up making the most difference is loosening the screw nearest the stabilizer. YMMVIn summary, it's a beautiful keyboard from a good company. My only complaint is that the default keymap totally butchers two of the four keys to the right of the spacebar and it's a minor nuisance to reconfigure them. I have no use for a 'Windows key' or 'Menu key' on the bottom right and would love for them to at the very minimum swap the right 'Windows key' with an 'Alt'. A lot of keycap sets do not come with multiple Windows keys (none of mine so far) so you'll end up putting a keycap at this location that doesn't correspond to the action of the press. A full GUI for customizing would be great; like iCue for Corsair and whatever the name of the program is from Glorious to tweak their boards.Final score: 9/10"", 'Not worth the money but fun to build.', 'So starting out with the cons.First of all I would suggest getting brand new stabilizers. I suggest the DeRock mount in stabilizers. I did have an issue with my PCB, the slash Key did not work. Then moving onto the pros.It is built out of very good material with the case and the PCB. It does not support five pin switches but that wasn’t a big deal for me because I used glorious pandas. And after you put foam at the bottom of your case. and tape mod your PCB. I would totally recommend this part which is Band-Aid mod in your stabilizers to remove the rattle in Clacky sound.', 'So I went with the cheap plate, that was available for the Drop Carina. Really nice looking, being in the plastic showing it new. Felt more flimsy, compared to the copper plate, but I had no problem with it. Installed it and everything was great. Only thing I would say since this is my first time putting the Carina together, is the plate being the exact size of the case, so it was a tight fit to push in.Overall, it’s a great plate IMO', 'This is a high end, beginner’s keyboard that’s easily available in the market right now. Other quality acrylic keyboards out there are hard to get. This keyboard, for what it is, is great. If you’re an enthusiast looking for a frosted acrylic keeb I don’t think this will disappoint. Just letting you know it is a north-facing led pcb. The brass plate I purchased makes it sound nearly as nice as south-facing pcbs though. The case has some heft without the brass plate. It doesn’t feel cheap at all. Imo, the best keyboard Drop has in their stock right now.Using gateron milky yellows to go along with the frosted acrylic look 👌will probably buy some translucent durock stabs, but the ones that come with it aren’t too bad just lube properly and adjust the wires. Great job!', 'Aside from the stabilizers, this keeb is amazing. It’s solid and feels premium. I got the brass plate and it sounds amazing with SA keycaps. Quality is incredible. I thought it would sound hollow but it doesn’t.Losing one star because of the stabilizers and you have to work hard to find any help with flashing it and customizing the keys. But it’s actually pretty simple if you find the right instructions.I highly recommend it. I love this beautiful thing.', ""The RGB on this keyboard is just unbeatable. The frosted acrylic smooths it out and the plate reflects a lot of the colors. Combined, this keyboard just looks like a full block of rainbow! I got some LTC Lava Caps that has shrinethrough legends, that really helps sell the block of RGB look.Quality of this keyboard is good - no flaws or anything and it was easy to assemble. The software through the drop website is great and makes it easy to customize the RGB (but a windows app would be even better).Great keyboard if you're after full RGB bling!"", 'Really wonderful keyboard. I code, write and work on multiple computers for a living.

Cumple con lo que promete! Yo de esas cosas no se mucho, solo me enfoque en buscar el original y quedó encantado!!!', 'Works', 'Es un accesorio útil si tienes un ratón compatible, como por ejemplo el Naga Pro wireless. En mi opinión debería de ser algo que venga de serie con el ratón, el precio es bastante caro para lo que es, pero puede encontrarse de oferta.La ventaja es que te permite dejar el ratón sobre la base para cargarlo, y te olvidas de pelearte con el conector cada vez que necesites batería. Al ser algo tan simple de hacer, es difícil que te quedes sin batería, ya que en el algún momento tendrás que dejar el PC, y cuando lo hagas solo tienes que acostumbrarte a dejar el ratón en la base. En la parte inferior tiene una linea que se ilumina con el color y efecto que elijas desde el software, aunque es mucho más simple que lo que te puedes encontrar en teclados y ratones de la marca. Otro plus es que puedes conectar el receptor usb del ratón en la misma base, por lo que solamente pierdes un puerto USB.Ahora bien, tiene sus pegas:- El conector es microUSB, a estas alturas debería de ser USB C por cuestión de comodidad, pero siendo algo que vas a conectar una sola vez cuando lo recibas y después te olvidas, tampoco es una pega muy grande.- Aunque sea un conector microUSB normal y corriente, la forma del cabezal DEBE de ser la del cable de Razer. Esto es debido a que es más estrecho y plano de lo normal, por lo que la mayoría de los cables ""normales"" no entran en el hueco.- El software. Es realmente lo que más quebraderos de cabeza puede dar. Si tienes software de otros perifericos de otras marcas mucho cuidado, ya que pueden interferir en la iluminación. El problema es que la base indica el estado de la carga a través de la iluminación tanto del ratón como de la base. Cuando colocas el ratón en la base, la iluminación cambia automáticamente y de forma instantanea para indicar el estado de la carga (rojo-naranja-verde dependiendo del nivel de carga). Cuando quitas el ratón de la base, vuelve instantaneamente a la iluminación personalizada que le has asignado. Si la iluminación no funciona correctamente puede ser complicado saber si el ratón está cargando o no, ya que se mantendrá la iluminación personalizada aunque lo coloques en la base. Si ves un comportamiento extraño en este aspecto, puede ser problema de software.- Si no instalas el software, por defecto la iluminación hará el ciclo de colores. Hubiera sido un puntazo que una vez que eliges un color, se guarde y ya no sea necesario el software. Pero al final, si usas un ratón de Razer, es prácticamente obligatorio su uso.', 'Buen accesorio para no estar dependiendo del cable ni pendiente de la carga.

Plug it into a usb port that has power after pc gets shut down and charge it overnight.One issue is that the usb port on the dock, which is intended for your mouse dongle, is useless for said purpose. Using this port I get frequent mouse disconnects with my death adder v2 pro which are fixed by plugging the dongle into the system itself. Annoying but the only issue with the product.', ""At its core, this is a convenience item. It makes it a lot easier to charge a wireless Razer mouse. Rather than connect the mouse's awkward cable into the mouse (with its unique profile)  every time you want to charge it, plug the cable into the dock, and plug the mouse signal receiver into the dock, then sit the mouse on top. It makes it a lot easier to charge the mouse in frequent short bursts, although sometimes I have had to try seating the mouse on top a few times - sometimes it will not fully connect, and light up purple instead of showing the charge level light.

Einzig während des Ladevorgangs ist das Licht immer an, da es den Ladestatus signalisiert (macht ja Sinn). Die Helligkeit, lässt sich aber auch für diesen Modus auf eine Angenehme Stufe herunter regeln.Das einzige Problem, welches bei mir aufgetreten ist, ist folgendes:Seit ich meinen Mausempfänger in die Station eingesteckt habe, kam es bereits mehrfach vor, dass nach dem PC-Start meine Maus nicht erkannt wurde, sprich die Station nicht erkannt wurde.Da hilft es dann, wenn man das USB Kabel an der Station aus und wieder einsteckt, danach wird alles sofort erkannt und funktioniert Problemlos.Das die Maus nicht erkannt wurde, hatte ich vor der Station noch nie. Ob das ganze tatsächlich damit zusammen hängt, oder ob das ein Problemchen an meinem Rechner allgemein liegt, kann ich nicht genau sagen.']"

Figured out that i would like something quieter and smooth, so the Kailh speed silver was the right choice. I ended up lubing the switches and stacking 2 o-rings under common keycaps to quieten it down further. Now about 4 months later I find myself very addicted to using this keyboard. Love the plush keys and soft ""thock"" sound... Its been a pleasure typing on this keyboard. I miss it on days when I have to return to office and type on the harsh laptop keyboard.', 'Very quality piece for the price', 'Paid extra for expedited delivery. Was disappointed  to see obvious chip offs on the underside of the keyboard. Wasn’t expecting such inferior quality product for the price paid.', ""This keyboard is sturdy and of excellent quality. Unfortunately, for the price, you can almost buy a Keychron Q1, which has superior build quality, enhanced features, and is better in every way. I do not recommend purchasing this item in 2023. However, if you do, you'll still be getting a quality keyboard with great aesthetic features."", ""It's a good keyboard, the whole thing is SOLID and made out of aluminium, it even uses magnets for the risers haha. Very responsive and tactile, and if you don't like the feel, you can hot-swap the switched if you desire and they even give you the tools to do so"", ""I bought this keyboard because I liked the TTY keycaps and was interested in cherry brown switches. I meant to order the high-profile case style, but got the low profile instead, which turns out to have been a happy accident.I'm not really a keyboard enthusiast, but when I was fortunate to get to work on many of the classic 90s unix workstations with mechanical keyboards and a number of now-classic terminals, Lears, VT100s, and so on. When I saw the Drop TTY keycaps, I had to have a set.The reason I decided to write a review is that today my idiot cat knocked over a mug of coffee on my desk and it went straight into the keyboard. So I figured-- now we'll see whether this thing is made well or not. Although it's a bit tedious, the fact that a person can pull all the keycaps and switches, take out a few screws, and have the thing completely disassembled is amazing. There was coffee everywhere inside, but the printed circuit board is coated in some kind of plastic so it wiped right off. A few of the keyswitches had coffee inside, but it was easy to blow it out with some compressed air, and worst case if the switch goes bad, I can just pop it out and replace it. In this case, the wet switches were on my arrow keys, and even though they seem to be working fine, I swapped their positions with some rarely used keys on the board. In fact, being able to reposition the keyswitches when reassembling the keyboard is nice since it allows you to spread the wear on the switches.As I mentioned, I wound up being really fond of the low profile case style, because all of the horrific debris that winds up under the keycaps doesn't make it down to the interior of the case, so it's relatively easy to pull the keycaps, blow the junk off, and then stick the caps back on.Finally, I don't really care about the LEDs, so it's nice that you can disable them with a firmware flash if you like.I type on this thing all day every working day, so although it's not an inexpensive option, as long as the PCB keeps working, any keyswitch failures would just involve swapping out a switch, so I suspect I may have this thing for a long time, and its kinda nice to have something that lasts when it comes to computer work."", ""You get a lot with this keyboard. Hot swappable pcb, cnc aluminum case, per key rgb, usb type c connection, and qmk programmability. Sure, its a tkl at the same price level as a Corsair K100 or a Logitech G915, but this keyboard (and the Drop Alt) isn't competing with those gaming models; its competing against custom builds and guys like GMMK Pro. I think the Drop CTRL is a great board, but isn't perfect. If you invest on it, it can become the perfect tkl board.Keycaps are pbt and are ok quality but I swapped them with better ones (worth mentioning that without lights on, legends on stock keycaps are very hard to read). Switches are ok too, Halo Clears feel much better than Cherry MX Browns and I suspect the same holds true for the Halo Trues, and since you can easily swap them I just got the MX Browns at a good price and replaced them with Boba U4s (I'd recommend getting the Halos and selling them if you don't like them). Stabs are the weakest point here, they kind of suck at this price point so you may want to replace them if you want the best experience (oddly enough I have 2 of these boards, in one the stabs are pretty ok, on the one I am reviewing here they sucked and I replaced them). I know many people have custom cables so the stock cable is almost irrelevant, but for this amount of money I expected a braided cable to use on the go.TL;DR: materials are top notch, features are great, out of the box it feels better than most keyboards from Corsair, Logitech, Razer, etc. To make it trully great you may have to invest on new stabs, keycaps and cable (in that order).Note: this thing draws a lot of power on max bright setting. Some custom cables may not provide enough power, specially if they are very long. I use mine with a powered usb hub and so far no issues with cables over 6'. If you use the stock cable you should be ok."", ""UPDATED:  Due to personal reasons, I was unable to return this keyboard within the return window.  That means I had to live with an expensive keyboard with issues.  I found that if I used the QMK firmware that is provided on GitHub and flashed that the problems I was experiencing disappeared.  So, the online configurator that DROP provides delivers flawed firmware, which was causing the issues.  Why they are behind an active open-source communities modifications baffles me.  My best guess is that it is due to the generic online QMK configurator not supporting every lighting configuration that the DROP keyboard supports (e.g., keyboard edge lighting) they are having trouble merging their customizations or just don't care.Since I am a veteran programmer, I was able to download the QMK firmware and modify it to do what I want with different layers and colors. Now it is a great keyboard from a crappy company.  I would definitely not recommend this keyboard to anyone who does not want to fiddle with firmware.  I have grown fond of the keyboard now that it is stable and is very configurable using my custom firmware.  It is great to type on with the Cherry-Brown switches and is very well-built. DROP has a lot to learn about customer support.ORIGINAL:If you want to flash customized firmware to this thing, it will cause you nothing but trouble.  The firmware that the DROP configurator creates has bugs that prevent one of the USB plugs from working and prevents the keyboard from powering on when you start the computer.  You can use the old firmware but then it will not remember your RGB settings every time you power on.  There is also a noticeable lag while typing.  As soon as I switched back to my Ducky keyboard, it was night and day as far as key press response goes.  When I contacted support about the USB and power on issues, and they told me they could not help me and I should ask in the community forums.  It was at that point that I boxed it up and plugged in my Ducky One 3 TKL.  I will be giving up the QMK customizations but shedding a company that does not care to support their products, which is a fair trade in my book."", 'I\'ve been using the DROP CTRL as my daily driver for over a year now and I\'m very satisfied with it. It\'s pricey for sure, but I have some very specific asks from a keyboard and this nailed all of them perfectly and I\'ve had no quality issues to speak of with it.Probably the major reason I wanted this model is the hot-swap keycaps. It\'s not exactly ""easy"" to remove the key switches, but after you do it several times, you can get the hang of doing it with the included tool. The Halo True keyswitches I received weren\'t really my thing, and I suspected that when I ordered. Personally I like linear quiet keyswitches like the Cherry MX silent. I bought some Gateron silent switches of various types off Ebay and swapped out all the switches with those, using lighter keyswitches for modifiers. For me, it\'s perfect, and the CTRL\'s hot-swap sockets made this easy.The included keycaps are lovely and a great design, I really like them. The one qualm I have about them is that I keep the lights off on the upper function row because otherwise they\'d reflect off my monitor, and with lights off, the stock keycaps can be quite hard to read. This is a very minor nitpick, though, and is probably true for any dark keys with shine-through keycaps.I also love that you can easily customize the keyboard layout, using QMK to do this was fairly easy. I\'m a developer so I even coded some specific tweaks I wanted. For example, I have the keyboard start up with a mid-brightness warm-white glow on all keys except the top row and spacebar (to avoid seeing the light from the edges reflecting off my screen). I also customized the Fn layer keys quite a lot and made Caps Lock an Fn key. I turned the ""Ins"" key into a Media Play/Pause key.I digress but the point is that if you want this sort of extreme customization, you\'ve got it with the CTRL and I\'d never buy another keyboard that doesn\'t have this sort of flexibility because now I\'m hooked on my obscure, personalized keyboard layout.', ""It looks great. It feels great. It IS great. I originally bought it with the Halo clears thinking they would be good quiet tactile switches, but really didn't like them and swapped them with gateron blue switches. Obviously not quiet but they feel fantastic. When picking which one you want in this keyboard I highly recommend that you feel that switch in person whether it be on a friend's keyboard or a small sampler.The software for this keyboard could be more user friendly especially for how expensive it is. If it's important to you you should watch a video on how to configure it before buying it, but if you even know what QMK is you're more than likely qualified to configure it pretty easily.There are cheaper alternatives for hotswappable mechanical keyboards that are still very nice like the Tecware Phantom, but nothing that is this good. This keyboard sits at the top of if not out of the price range for most gamers but is more than reasonable for keyboard enthusiasts.This keyboard is not for everyone. You are buying a whole experience not just a hotswappable keyboard. You're paying for the sleek aluminum base, the keycaps, the hotswappability, the RGB, and the reliability since this thing is YouTubes golden child. My favorite part about this design is you can put it in just about any setup. It looks clean and professional but also can match an aggressive gamer setup just by adjusting the lights. A potential downside that I noticed is the keycaps are unreadable without some light under them. I actually like it because it makes any RGB effects where the lights go out more fun but see how it could get annoying.A tip if you've already bought it and are trying to change out the switches with the given tool, wedge in the tool under one of the grabbable sides of it and turn it to loosen the switch before trying to pull it out. Those contact points squeeze on the pins surprisingly hard.""]"

À mon avis, le trackball est à réserver à des usages spécifiques, où l'espace est compté, ce qui est le cas pour cet achat. En cas d'usage intensif, il y a quand même une grosse fatigue du pouce... C'est peut être pas dramatique, mais les tendinites peuvent être très gênantes et compliquées à gérer. Ce trackball est de très bonne qualité. Je n'ai pas hésité à racheter du Perixx, car, que ce soit les claviers ou les souris, je n'ai pas été déçu. Pourvu que ça dure..."", 'Fonctionne bien. S’installe facilement.Mais obligé de mettre une note de 3 étoiles car 2 ans et 6 mois après la souris est HSUtilisation normale de bureau par un adulte pour le travail 😔Dommage je dois en commander une autre.', ""I used to love my Logitech M570 trackball and have used Logitech's keyboards and mice for years and years. But, when the left and right buttons on my M570 started acting weird and I found out that you have to buy new micro switches for them and solder them in yourself to fix it, I started shopping for a new trackball.It's not easy to find a good trackball mouse at a low price, but I think I finally have. I'm surprised that trackballs aren't more popular and commonly used given that they take up little space, are easy on your arm and wrist and can be so much more precise than a regular mouse.  I'd not heard of Perixx before, so I read every review on ever site that I could find before buying this mouse.I use trackball mice because I do a lot of text, image and audio editing for work. I also enjoy turn-based and real-time strategy games which benefit from very precise cursor control.Out of the box, I wasn't so sure about this Perixx trackball because it seemed like the cursor zinged all over the place and the buttons didn't do what I thought they'd do. But, then I downloaded the software driver and configure program from the Perixx website Perixx USA (Perixx.com). The site listed in the manual doesn't work anymore, but a quick search found the one that does.  It was easy to find the right driver and install it. Though once I opened the software, it took a bit to figure out which button some of the options were pointing to. Maybe color coding the options with the buttons on the graphic would help.Now, that I've configured the trackball to my liking, I love it! It controls the cursor very precisely, especially after I adjusted the DPI (dots of movement per inch - or how far the mouse cursor travels on the screen relative to how much you have to move the ball) from the default 1600 down to 800. Might seem counter intuitive, but I found after reading articles about DPI and experimenting with settings, that actually lower is better when it comes to making a trackball more accurate. I'm glad that the DPI is easy to change. You can even switch from the high setting that you chose to the low setting that you chose without opening the software, by flipping a switch on the bottom of the mouse.The buttons are all easy to reach while focusing on the computer screen which is critical while playing RTS and shooter games. The little button behind the scroll wheel and between the left and right buttons is a little weird but I set it to a generic 'click' setting so that hitting it by accident won't do anything unusual until I get used to it being there.I love that you can program the buttons so much. It's cool to set one of the little buttons above the trackball to a rapid fire left or right click. Really handy for games that make you hammer away on the mouse buttons. Now, I can just hold this button down to auto fire like you can on some third party console controllers.Some people complain about the scroll wheel not feeling smooth, but I actually like it being like it is because it feels like I can control the amount that I scroll more precisely, especially after slowing the scroll speed down in the software. Out of the box, it was too sloppy for me but that was easily remedied. That's why I give the 'Easy to use' only four stars - because you have to configure the trackball before it really works like it should.The ball itself is purple which isn't my favorite color, but I'm not paying extra in a different transaction to buy a different colored ball. Would have been nice if Perixx had given me the option to choose a different color at the outset. I'll get used to purple eventually. :)I like the satin finish of the whole thing. Not too slick but not too textured either. It has a good shape that lets your hand relax while still being able to reach all the buttons. The two things that I never really liked about my Logitech Trackman Marble Mouse, as much as I like it, were that your hand got cramped after an hour of use and it didn't have a scroll wheel. This Perixx trackball solves both things.I also love that you can still find a wired version of this mouse. I had a wireless mouse with the M570 and hated having to change out batteries just to keep the accuracy as high as possible. Waste of money and materials having to put batteries in things like keyboards and mice for a desktop PC, so I prefer wired for those things."", 'MX ERGOが壊れてしまったので､前から気になっていたこのトラックボールを買ってみました｡操球性とても良く､分解や修理も容易そうなので､シンプルかつコストパフォーマンスの良いデバイスだと思いました｡ですが､気になったところが何箇所かあります｡1,角度を調整するならリストレストが必須角度調整の部品をつけると､手首のところが浮いてしまうので､リストレスト的なものをかませることによって良い感じになりました｡2,ホイールの角度調整がされていないホイールの角度が良くも悪くも垂直になっており､角度の調整ができないため､気になる場合は気をつけたほうがいいと思います｡どうにか角度を調整してみようと試みましたが､諦めました｡角度がフィットしないのが不快までいかないけどちょっと…という感じはありますが､気にしなければ平気で使えると思います｡3,筐体が薄くて安っぽい値段が値段なので仕方ないんですが､筐体の厚みが薄めな感覚があります｡悪い言い方をすれば安っぽいですが､別に気にしなければいいと思いました｡というわけで､気になってしまうポイントはありますが､値段相応､と考えれば安い買い物だと思いました｡おすすめです｡', ""I have large hands and needed a wired trackball for work.

Then I tried this Perixx trackball and it fit my hand perfectly, and even better than the Logitech.  But the ball in the first one I got rolled very roughly.  So I returned it through Amazon and got another one.  This second one rolls fairly smoothly.  But even after a week of use, it is still not as smooth as the Logitech nor the other higher end trackballs I've tried.  I believe Perixx uses lower quality rollers than the other popular brands.  I tried likely lubricating the rollers with oil and that did help.  Vaseline might be the next thing I try.  And if that doesn't work, I may try swapping out the rollers themselves.Overall, this Perixx trackball is very nice.  I just wish the ball rolled more smoothly.

Theres no unreplaceable battery that you have to charge so you can just swap the batteries out but it does mean occasionally buying some unless you have some rechargable AAA ones. The main negative though and why this only got 4 stars is because of the scroll wheel. I already sent one back because when I try to scroll down a page it would randomly scroll up and down. The thing that points to this being a problem is that the replacement I got sent also has the same problem. I couldn't be bothered sending it back again, and it does seem to have mostly gone away after using it for some time, but this is a thing that would might put people off buying one.

Switching switches is easy, aluminium frame makes it very sturdy. I realized I got the old model, with no adjustable magnetic legs to raise the height. Slightly disappointed, but I'd already changed out all the switches, a little late to be asking for a Return."", 'This is a DIY keyboard of course. I took it a few steps further. You may also consider doing the following. Bringing this into the realm of a truly world class board at not much additional cost. As it stands, this now very well may be my end game.First of all, all these mini keyboards do not weigh much. So slip and slide on your desk. How did I remedy that? I laser cut out the entire bottom of the case. I replaced it with a machined to fit brass billet. Now it weighs a whopping 18 pounds. That took care of the movement issue.Next I made some interesting Panda switches for it. Halo True with Box Black. Very similar to the True but a little more forgiving. I am a touch typist and do not bottom out on any MX switch anyways.Then I added top of the line PBT KAT 1.75MM key caps. Of course the light does not shine through, but again I am a touch typist. I hardly mind. I actually keep the backlight on 1 for longevity. A little tidbit: if the backlight is left on 1 theoretically it should last 75 years. Unlikely however. Although with Hot swap who cares.Finally I built a custom wood ""rocker"" wrist rest to match this boards 1.75"" height. I built it out of rare Lemon wood.In closing it came out to about 600 bucks. Still less than the least expensive completed Korean. I feel it is better than most any board with MX. I have 5 Korean\'s. Until I got this my daily driver was a HHKB Pro 2. I have not touched another board since I got this. Honeymoon? I doubt it. This is right for me. Sure, the switches are different than Topre. I like them better in fact. Even if you do just a standard build of this board it is top quality. I would instantly choose it over the  KBD67 or other such boards. Even though this is made in China. That hardly matters here. The quality is proven. Even though mine is beyond a regular build of this board I doubt I look back anytime soon.Caveat: I think Amazon states I bought a full board. I indeed purchased the barebones. I am not sure how that occurred. Obviously I did not pay more to rip apart an entire board.I forgot to mention they must have updated the stabilizers everyone complained about. Mine has no stabilizers at all. It just has ""dummy"" switches on the sides of the larger keys and spacebar. These do not seem to be hot swappable. They are not actually switches with a spring. they are just a slider to stabilize the key.Also if you buy the complete board I would not be afraid of Tai Hao key caps. Even though they are not thick they are Double shot POM and very sturdy with a very nice feel. They are a good $60 set. KAT they are not however. Although if you want the shine through they are a very good choice. As good as anything else shine through.This is a very good board and priced accordingly.', 'TL;DR: Great board if you want something premium feeling without having to wait for a group buy. Most of the issues can be boiled down to ""user preference"" besides the stabs. This is overall the best  in-stock board out there, but if you don\'t mind waiting or having a poly-carb board maybe get something like the Kara/NK65/Portico instead.Overall the board is a good choice if you want something made of Aluminum that feels premium without having to wait on group buys. It has a nice, heavy, frame with a consistent finish that feels sturdy in the hands.  The included keycaps are great but I did replace them as they are not my style. I also replaced the Halo Trues with Tangerine V2s. I really only bought the fully kitted out board so I could have some spare Halo trues around for when I Frankenstein switches together. Some people have complained about the board sounding hollow/pingy but I have not found that to be the case at all. I did add foam to the bottom just because I had some around, but I do not feel like that is necessary at all.  It does have an integrated plate, which can make the typing experience ""stiff"" but I think that is going to boil down to individual preference. I personally think linear switches work really well with stiff boards, but with tactile switches it depends on the tactile bump of the switch. Since it\' has a hotswap PCB it is super easy to swap around switches and see what works for you. On the topic of the PCB, it does have north facing LEDS meaning that cherry profile keycaps feel and sound slightly different.  Overall the single worst part about the board is the included stabilizers, which you should replace or at least lube. The included stabs feel like the most bargain bin ones they could have included, to the point where that alone drops the quality down to a 4 for me.  I do think this board should be  sold at $150-$180 instead of the $250 MSRP. If it was regularly sold at $150 it would be a 4/5 value wise. I do think its more of a ""premium"" experience than some of the poly-carb budget boards that have been popping up(IE NK65 entry edition), but those boards are better values for what they are priced at. I would also say this is better than boards like the Tofu.  Overall this is a great board if you want something now that feels/looks like  a high end board , but if you are willing to wait maybe join a group buy instead due to the various problems this board has. If Drop ever makes a V2 of this board/makes a brand new board, they really need to include some decent screw in stabs and flip the pcb orientation.', 'I ordered this in gray, evidently with ""Kaihua Box White"" keys.  They\'re clicky, responsive, and quick.  Only once in the last month or so did I experience a key sticking for a moment, but the key action has been flawless otherwise.  I\'m new to these high-end keyboards, and use it only for typing for work (not gaming), but it sure makes the typing and work more enjoyable, compared to the short-travel keyboard on my laptop.  I have also used various external wired and wireless keyboards from Dell, Apple, and other big names companies connected to desktop computers, but this one is the best.  Is it worth the $200 premium for my purposes?  For those days that i spend 90% of my work day behind an office computer, I think so.  I wouldn\'t take it traveling, though, since it literally weighs as much as brick.I bought this particular model because of the great reviews, I\'m familiar with the refined tastes of the drop.com membership, and because of the very small form factor, which lets me keep the mouse close to the alpha keys that i use (i.e., not another 5 inches of numeric keypad squeezed between mouse and keyboard).Minor complaints (some of which are fixable by replacing or reprogramming the keys) are:- a few keys that i like to use (such as tilde and dedicated function keys) are not on this keyboard;  the function keys are accessed with fcn-#, so there\'s no loss in functionality.- the backlit keys aren\'t very bright, and since the keys themselves are gray, it is sometimes hard to find symbols i\'m looking for (the ones shared by the numbers) in daylight use.  The symbols and numbers are also unnecessarily close together, making it harder to pick through symbols with similar topologies that are on adjacent keys, like $/% and &/8.- the keyboard is raised fairly high.  If you are replacing direct typing on a laptop keyboard, where the tops of the keys may be 1cm above the table surface, you\'ll have to raise your arms 1.5-2cm higher to touch the tops of these keys (it\'s not a trivial height difference).  This implies some adjustments to lower table height or raise your chair and/or armrests.- i would love a tactile indicator on a couple of keys (like a Braille dot on D and K) so my fingers will know exactly where they are on the keyboard when they touch down.I may order a few replacement keys to address the nits above.If you have neighbors in your office, they may not appreciate the clicking sound.  Personally, i enjoy hearing myself work.', 'Let me just say i went through my fair share of keyboards  - corsairs, razers then moving on to more limited production keebs like IC nightfox and kira,  after which i was faced with a choice (since i really started liking the 65% format) of whether i go build my own keeb or buy a better production board. The issue with building your own is there is no good choice for rgb backlit due to the way the LEDs are facing. As far as I know, all custom build boards have south facing leds (in order to fit certain key caps). Since i game and use it at nighttime , backlit keycaps  is a very much needed feature for me.So something like the Drop Alt made sense.The quality is great, over 2lbs of weight, and comes with all the features that you could possibly want. What keeps this keyboard from being the absolute Apex of all 65% production boards out there is the out of the box stabs, key caps, and ping noise. Luckily all those can be fixed for relatively cheap and relatively quick. If you buy this keyboard, I would strongly encourage you to make those few upgrades - lube and clip stabs, band aid mod, and use some shelf liner to fill in the empty space between the pcb and the bottom piece of the board to eliminate the keyboard pinging sound.The keycaps can be easily replaced but the stock ones are not too bad just your average pbt caps and really dont match the quality of this keyboard in my opinion.It sounds like much especially for  an expensive keeb but its quite easy to do and  i found that after making those upgrades, the experience is  night and day. I didnt take any stars off because these upgrades are optional are not needed but very much recommended.On my version i also changed the switches to Aliaz 70g and swapped the keycap set to tai hao miami. if you plan on doing that , you may want to opt for the barebones version.I am extremely satisfied with this board, it is very quiet, the stabs sound great, the lighting is excellent. Also the firmware takes a few minutes to get used to but it works really well.Also Amazon did an excellent job delivering this in 2 days after placing the order ( i am not a prime member).', ""This keyboard has a top-notch build quality. I'm familiar with the custom keyboard community, and have done a great deal of research about keyboards before buying this one. I have a custom keyboard already, and I'm fairly aware of the build quality you can get for this type of money.While you could theoretically get a keyboard of similar quality for less money, this is an excellent option for anybody looking for custom build quality without the difficulty of actually building a custom. While it isn't that hard, it can take a great deal of time to individually order all of the parts that you need, since they're often parts of group-buys or are out of stock.This keyboard has a fantastic case build from aluminum and it weighs a great deal, which keeps it steady on your desk. The lighting is fantastic, and it comes with PBT key caps, which are what you should be looking for. The milling is smooth and the finish gives it an attractive aesthetic.It has a 65% build, which means that while it doesn't have a number pad or a function line, it still has directional arrows and a couple other useful keys.It's a fantastic keyboard, and the only downside is that you have to use the QMK software, which is not so easy to use if you not are tech-savvy. If you don't want to use that software, you can simply use the existing configuration of the keyboard, so if you want to customize, you have to figure that you.The only other complaint I could have is that the stabilizers are not good, but they are also not particularly bad (at least the stabs on my keyboard), but, it's very easy to replace them and you can do that for less than twenty dollars.I'd say buy it, if you want a keyboard that will last you pretty much forever, you should get this. You can change the switches any time that you want and you aren't limited in your selection. While this keyboard may cost a lot, it is made of excellent materials and allows you to continue customizing down the road if you want to."", ""This keyboard is pretty great stock. Small but hefty, Cherry MX Browns sound decent stock but the stabilizers are buns. I'd recommend Cherry Plate mount stabs, band aid mod and some foam. If you really want to go all out, lube your switches. There are plenty of YouTube tutorials to do this.In terms of the software, yes it's kind of inconvenient. But I don't think changing LEDs is something you do every day (I change LEDs for holidays like Halloween).  A lot of people seem to be having trouble so I'm gonna post a short tutorial to make it really easy. 1) Download the applet-mdflash.bin and mdloader_windows.exe from the GitHub(the little card that comes in the box will tell you where to get this). Put both of those downloaded files in a folder called Keyboard Config.2) Open the folder, right click and create a new text file. Change the extension to .bat. Rename it to whatever you want.3) Right click your new bat file, click edit and type in this:@echo offset /p ConfigFile=Enter config file path:mdloader_windows.exe --first --download %ConfigFile% --restartpause4) Go to the Drop keyboard configurator, which will allow you to configure your keyboard. Then compile it and when it asks you where to save it, save it to the Keyboard Configurator folder that you made in step 1.5) double click your .bat file. It will ask you for the config file you downloaded in step 4.  Press Tab until you see that file name. Hit enter and then press the reset button under your keyboard.6)Your config should be applied. You can save multiple config files, and by running that .bat file you can apply any config in your Keyboard Config folder easily (by pressing Tab to cycle through all the files in the folder), without having to change the file name every time you want to change your config.Hopefully this makes it a bit easier to apply different configs."", ""Coming from a logitech gaming keyboard (g413), the key strokes sound and feel much better. The keyboard overall is high quality and looks great. I bought this keyboard as a starting point for modding. Although, the stock stabilisers rattle and overall are pretty bad, can easily be replaced. In my opinion, this keyboard should not be bought if you aren't planning on replacing any parts. Might as well buy something cheaper at that point."", ""My Drop Alt said it was new. Obviously it was not new as it came in a brown box. the feet. The software is also so convoluted and stupid. Every time you want to change the led lights you first have to take two files and put them in a folder, then download firmware from their website and put said firmware into folder with other files, then open the command terminal and change the directory with newly downloaded files, then run a command to flash firmware to the keyboard, oh and while it's doing this you either have to turn the keyboard off with a paper clip underneath or hold  FN + B to turn the keyboard off and hope the firmware flashes to the keyboard. This took 3 hours the first time to get no error code. YOU HAVE TO DO THIS EVERY TIME TO CHANGE EVEN A SINGLE COLOR. Oh and they made it so you can't save multiple light profiles to the keyboard, and as soon as you do a light profile it makes it impossible to use the other preset ones. I mean even cheap $50 chinese keyboards have rgb software built in, are you guys really that lazy? The build is so solid though and the Halo Clear switches are so nice I am keeping it, there really is no equivalent unless you build your own keyboard and because of corona virus it's near impossible right now. I got the silver color and it's almost identical to the color of a space gray mac pro. It's also heavy as hell and the keycaps are a medium gray in the middle and a really dark gray on the outside that almost look black. The light bar has awful diffusers so you can see all the individual leds, they could have tried harder.Pros: Beautiful machined aluminum frame that you really can't get elsewhere in a prebuilt  Really nice switches that feel stable  USB C on left and right side, although I couldn't get the board to flash on the right side  Great keycaps, real smooth to the touch, don't feel like cheap gritty keycaps  LED lights get real bright and easy to remember macro keys.Cons: Worst rgb and macro software any company on earth has ever implemented.  New package might not be new  Bad stabilizers, but not that bad, it's the same as any Razer, Corsair, or Steel Series board.  Light bar has bad diffuser.  Once again horrible software, I had to use Reddit for 3 hours to fix their incompetence in software.  Again, what is wrong with you guys, why didn't you just build simple software, everyone else can do it why  can't you.  Don't think you can use QMK, you would have to dedicate months of learning how to program to use QMK."", ""High quality build that will certainly last longer than my parent's marriage. Premium feel, real boujee.Has some real weight and heft.This is deceptively a chonker and in the heavyweight class despite the cute size.Keycaps feel great and lots of QoL. You'll keep fingering it that's for sure.A con will be that it is very costly compared to competitors of similar quality. Ain't no messing with a broke mf. Alternatively, going custom on a similar budget may yield a more personalized feel of similar quality. But you pay what you get for.Best to get a braided cord as well for it as while it does come with it's own USB C cord, it's the standard vanilla kind. You might as well spend on one if you can afford this.Overall, great keyboard. Pricey. But real good.I can type URL's and work on spreadsheets in style and comfort.PS: Tested this on some sweaty Apex platinum lobby ranked games and least to say it's definitely a great keebs for gaming as well as working.Attached is a picture with a Corsair full 104 kb for comparison.""]"

Ich hatte bereits ein Modell schon seit mehreren Monaten in Gebrauch und habe es immer noch. Es ist nach Dauernutzung (beruflich UND privat, fast 24H) immer noch fast wie neu.Sehr gute FLießgeschwindigkeit (mit einer Razer Naga Trinity).Man merkt keine Grate in der Oberfläche, auch kein auffälliges Kratzen etc. Alles in Allem absolut empfehlenswert.', 'Alles gut', 'Update +1 Stern: Ich habe das kleine nun gegen das große Mauspad ausgetauscht und muss feststellen, dass sich die Oberfläche geändert hat. Der Stoff ist härter, sodass die Maus (Kone Aimo) besser gleitet. Die Präzision war schon immer gut und einer der Kritikpunkte ist jetzt weg. Was bleibt istUm den Overkill komplett zu machen wollte ich der neu erworbenen Roccat Vulcan 120-Tastatur und der Kone AIMO-Maus jetzt auch das passende Mauspad zur Seite stellen. Ersetzt werden sollte ein XXL-Mauspad von Titanwolf, das bislang die gesamte Schreibtischplatte bedeckte und auch schon mit der Vorgängermaus, einer Roccat Kone XTD, perfekt harmonierte. Dazu kamen gute Erfahrungen mit einem Roccat Kange (dort allerdings mit einer Logitech G9).Den Erstkontakt mit der Maus kann man als kratzig beschreiben. Die Maus gleitet bei Weitem nicht so mühelos über das Pad wie ich das bislang gewohnt war. Reaktion und Kontrolle waren zwar spitze, aber es war dennoch ein Rückschritt. Man gewöhnt sich allerdings sehr schnell daran. (SIEHE OBEN, beim XXL ist die Oberfläche härter!)Die Beleuchtungseffekte reduzieren sich auf zwei unterschiedliche Farben, die mehr oder weniger ineinander übergehen. Der Knopf schaltet die Beleuchtung nur ein oder aus. Für alles andere muss man die entsprechende Software - die den Begriff Overkill neu definiert - installieren. In meinem Fall brauchte ich das nicht, denn die war dank Maus und Tastatur ohnehin installiert; insofern macht es dann wieder Sinn, alles mit einer (1) Software zu steuern. (UPDATE: Dem Knopf können in der Swarm-Software verschiedene Funktionen zugewiesen werden!)Die Dicke des Pads ist in Ordnung und wird durch die Dicke der Beleuchtung definiert. Stören tut das höhere Pad nicht, es ist immer noch dünner als die legendären 1 €-Mauspads eines schwedischen Möbelhauses. Was ein wenig stört ist der kleine Kasten mit der Bedieneinheit und der Lichtquelle. Wenn man sein Mauskabel zusammen mit dem Tastaturkabel verlegt und es unter den Aufstellfüßen der Tastatur verlegt, hakt der so entstehende Bogen oft und gerne an der Kante. Aber das mache vielleicht nur ich so.Als Komplettierung des mit passender Tastatur und Maus ausgestatteten Schreibtischs ist das Mauspad quasi ein Muss und vom Preis her als Gimmick noch vertretbar, aber ansonsten würde ich es nicht empfehlen. Es funktioniert, ist aber nicht der erhoffte Hammer.', 'For me the size is just what I\'m looking for. I have to admit I was a little disappointed I couldn\'t just plug it into a USB power hub and go from there. I reworked some things and now - WOW! It\'s synced with my Roccat keyboard.

Lighting customizations are easy.All in all if you like rgb gaming stuff this is a very good item.', 'Ja, ich weiß, viele denken, es kommt beim zocken am meisten auf einen guten PC an, eine gute Tastatur und eine gute Maus. Das stimmt auch. jedoch ist ein gutes Mauspad genau so wichtig. Da ich schon eine Roccat Vulcan 121 Aimo habe (gekauft bei MediaMarkt) und eine Kone Aimo Remastered (Ebenfalls gekauft bei MediaMarkt) habe ich auch zu einem Roccat Mauspad gegriffen. Ich hatte vorher ein Werbegeschenk Mauspad und dachte immer, das ein Mauspad ein Mauspad ist und das sie sich nur in der Optik unterscheiden. Ich lag vollkommen falsch. Wenn ich jetzt auf meinem alten Mauspad spiele fühlt es sich an als wolle ich die Maus auf einem Stein bewegen. Sie rutscht einfach nicht so gut. Das war mir nie aufgefallen. Bis jetzt. Sie rutscht nun super und geschmeidig über das Mauspad von Roccat. Und die Optik - Naja, ist halt Roccat, also kann man sichs denken... EINFACH MEGA! Es passt Super zu meiner Kone Aimo Maus und meiner Vulcan 121 Aimo mit Taktilen Titan Switches. Kann ich beides übrigens ebenfalls empfehlen, aber das ist ein anderes Thema. Ein kleiner Kritikpunkt: manchmal stoße ich vorne mit der Maus gegen das Power-Teil, dieses ist relativ breit. Aber trotzdem ist dieses Maupad für mich ein Must-Have. Super Verarbeitung, gut durchdacht und MEGA OPTIK!Ich freue mich über ein Hilfreich Feedback, wenn dir die Rezension geholfen hat :D', 'Nachdem ich nun zum ersten Mal ein RGB-Rig durchziehe - das abgesehen von meinem Roccat-Ensemble wirklich hübsch leuchtet - spielt dieses Feature aktuell einfach eine zentrale Rolle. Für mich jedenfalls.Ich bitte darum, diese Rezension vor allem in diesem Licht zu betrachten und zu relativieren. Wem RGB eher egal ist, der sollte sich fairerweise an anderen Rezensionen orientieren (und überlegen, wofür sie/er ein RGB-Mousepad braucht :D)Und na klar tönt es schon durch: Mein Roccat-Ensemble aus Horde-Tastatur+Kone Maus in jeweils weiß in Zusammenspiel mit dem Mousepad lässt die Tastatur erscheinen, als würde sie auf der ITS liegen und künstlich beatmet. Die LEDs wirken komplett anders. Bei Tag ist es nur traurig, bei mehr Dunkelheit ist es schmerzhaft. Einfach deshalb, weil man es sich selbst zu zusammengestellt hat.Mir ist bewusst, dass es ein Detail ist, aber für mich ist es ein wichtiges: Ich bin aus dem RGB-Kirmes-Alter raus. Ich möchte es ästhetisch haben statt super dynamisch und zappelig. Mein Lieblingseffekt ist der: Alle RGBs (des jeweiligen Universums, hier des Warm-Universums von Roccat) leuchten in der selben, synchronisierten Farbe und wechseln synchron in eine andere Farbe. Slow, bright, nice. Diesen Effekt haben alle Hersteller meiner Geräte im Angebot. Selbst das Drecks Sharkoon-Case TG4 kann das (nur lüften kann es nicht, aber das ist ein anderes Thema und dort behandelt worden). Die freundliche Anna vom Support sagt, es könnte wohl sein, dass das irgendwann auch mal gemacht wird, aber aktuell seien dafür keine Anhaltspunkte gegeben. Man entwickel AIMO weiter. Das - mein statement - unverständlich chaotische, angeblich aber ""intelligente"" RGB-Steuerungssystem von Roccat. Meine Test haben ergeben: Wenn ich etwas mache, blinkt irgendwas. Oder etwas ändert seine Farbe. Oder wird heller. Oder so.Eine ästhetische Harmonie kann ich nicht erkennen. Allerdings bescheinigt mir die Software auch nur 75 Prozent RGB-Erfolg. Ich habe nämlich nur 3 Geräte statt 4. Wenn ich auch noch das Headset kaufe, dann würde vielleicht alles besser? Wenn ich ALLES von Roccat habe? Uiuiui. Diesen Eindruck zu erwecken, Roccat, nehme ich Dir persönlich übel. Bauernfängerei. Das ist Apple, nur schlecht kopiert.Dass Roccats RGB-Geräte zusammen eher bemitleidenswert aussehen, betrachte ich nun als persönliches Pech. War ja alles auch nicht wirklich teuer.Dass der erwähnte simple Effekt nicht mal für die Einzelgeräte angeboten wird, geschweige denn synchronisiuert, ärgert mich ebenfalls sehr persönlich. Das ist unverdient. Dann lasst doch bitte RGB einfach weg und niemand ärgert sich.Deshalb würde ich das Produkt für meinen ganz persönlichen Usecase - in dem RGB eine vergleichsweise große Rolle spielt - nicht empfehlen. Das tut mir leid, da ich den Kram nun privat abgeben und mir selbst doch wieder was von Corsair holen werde. Die für ihre Preispolitik eben auch kein ""Bravo!"" verdient haben.Aber dafür sind die RGB-Goodies von Corsair - jedes für sich genommen UND alle miteinander - schön. Ich war vor dem Roccat-Ausflug ein Corsair-Fanboy und ich kehre auch dort hin zurück.Da mir die Ästhetik des gesamten Rigs am Herzen liegt, ist Roccat aktuell eben keine Option.Das empfinde ich nach all der Quälerei und investierten Zeit, um mich für die Peripheriegeräte zu entscheiden, als in höchstem Maße ärgerlich.', 'Integriert sich gut in die Peripherielandschaft mit anderen Roccat AIMO Geräten.Haftet allerdings unfassbar schlecht an der Tischoberfläche. Bei normalen Spielszenarien verrutscht sie sofort. Das schaffen wesentlich günstigere Pads wesentlich besser.', 'Das Mousepad ist ein Geschenk für einen Freund. Er liebt es. Es ist angenehm groß und funktioniert auch, mit dem richtigen Treiber und der passenden Tastatur, super was die Beleuchtung betrifft. Er gibt dem Mousepad 10/10.']"

The side grips are a very nice touch, they have a great material that doesn't allow your fingers to slide even if you get slightly sweaty fingers like I do sometimes.All of that aside, it's an ASUS ROG product, which usually comes in with a high price tag, for not always a significantly better product. But here, it feels all ROG in build quality, for a very affordable price. Picked mine up while listed at $58.99 USD - which happens to be cheaper than any of the Razer Deathadder models I've purchased in the past. As is standard with ASUS ROG products, it comes with a nice array of extras: 2 different length cables, a 1 meter and 2 meter, a very nice metal ROG Sticker, a carrying pouch and MOST IMPORTANTLY REPLACEMENT SWITCHES! This is what really sold me on the mouse. In the event that you actually do wear the switches out, or perhaps would just like to try out the feel of the included additional set, you can do that! Every other mouse I've purchased never came with replacement switches - and whenever it would begin to either double click, or not register clicks I'd just have to suck it up and buy another mouse.Lastly, I've seen some other people struggle with pairing the RGB with the Armoury Crate/ASUS Aura apps. I did NOT have this issue at all, not sure if related to the fact that I have a ASUS Rog Strix B550-F Wifi MOBO? But regardless, the mouse functions flawlessly in all aspects, with some very nifty included treats from ASUS.Absolutely 5/5."", 'For a few years I struggled with a Corsair M65 RGB Elite Gaming Mouse with the horrible double click, making it useless for gaming and for digital design projects.

Hopefully this review will clear some things up for anyone who\'s confused.IMPORTANT: The mouse has stickers on the bottom, if you don\'t remove these stickers, the mouse feels like molasses. I don\'t blame anyone for not noticing these, as there was no obvious indication of their existence that I could see, which I would say is a failing on the part of the company. You could easily miss them even if you looked directly at them, as they\'re clear plastic. This is only an issue however if you don\'t know about it.THE GRIP The 5-8 buttons are not designed to be hit with the tip of your finger as I\'ve seen some people do. The buttons are angled so that you can comfortably push backwards or forwards on them with the joint of your thumb as I demonstrate in the video I\'ve attached. The grip on the forwards button makes it easy to rest your thumb on it and also hit the back button with the joint of your thumb if/when you don\'t need to use the 1-8 buttons, and just want to use it like a normal mouse  with only two side buttons. I would say the back button is the only button I\'m not super keen on: It\'s designed to be pushed up and is very sensitive, which is slightly awkward at times, but feels great other times. Generally there aren\'t any buttons that are difficult to hit on their own, but there are some button combinations that are more difficult to hit in quick succession than others. If you need it for something fast paced, figure out which button combos are easier to hit in succession, and plan your hotkeys accordingly.THE SOFTWARE A few people seem to be having trouble with the software. My guess is that they haven\'t downloaded the correct software for their mouse. It\'s a bit confusing, but every Redragon mouse has its own specific program you need to download, so I suspect the people having troubles have downloaded the software for a different mouse. As for the software itself, it\'s a little confusing, but not terrible. I saw some people complaining that the back and forwards buttons are too high up, which I could see being the case for some people, but they didn\'t seem to understand that they could just make some of the lower down buttons do it instead, as all of the buttons are fully configurable with this software, which makes me feel like a lot of people don\'t know how to use it. Here\'s a basic rundown of the software:- A profile contains all of your configured key-binds. You can create as many profiles as you want, and even save and import them (which I would recommend doing as the software can be a bit buggy sometimes). There are only 5 modes however, and these are the things you can actually switch between. You can set a profile for each mode, then you can set a button that switches between them (this needs to be done for each profile). There are buttons go that back and forth between the modes, but I haven\'t found a way to select a specific mode with a specific button, so it\'s okay if you only need 2 - 3 modes, but 4 - 5 might be a bit unwieldy.To configure a button:- Go to customize- Pick between front and side buttons (right under the  picture of the mouse), and select the button you want  to change.- Select from the drop down menu what action you want (single and combo key-binds are under ""advance"" for some reason at the time of writing this review)- For a key-bind, click the ""edit"" button (it might show up as ""stop"", in which case you\'re already editing) and enter the key-bind, then click ""stop"".- Click apply (your mouse will stop working momentarily).I wish I could tell you how to do the macros, but sadly I have no idea, as I don\'t have much need for them.NOTE: avoid pressing the ""cancel"" button, I don\'t know why but it always messes things up for me.CONCLUSION Overall, it\'s a great mouse, especially for the price; there are plenty of non MMO mice more expensive than this, and not as good. However, note that I got it primarily for shortcuts that allow me to use my computer one handed (no not for that reason). I have played some games with it and noticed I was playing noticeably better, but they weren\'t competitive or extremely difficult games so take that for what you will.That\'s all. Hopefully some people found this helpful.Cheers.', 'Don\'t buy this mouse unless you have a degree in computer engineering.  I know a lot of people gave it a really good review.  But that\'s only because they somehow already knew how the software works and was able to get some use out of it.  For those of us like myself who are new to using more complex mice with many buttons,  forget it.  Apparently Redragon would rather keep how to use these profile software programs a big secret.First of all, the software itself is not intuitive at all.  You will NOT figure out how to use it simply by looking at the buttons and menu options.  In fact, some things seem like they would be obvious.  But they\'re not.  Things won\'t work like you THINK they\'re going to work.Like, for instance, I never did figure out how to do something as idiot-simple as binding a single key to a mouse button.  That SHOULD be intuitive and easy to figure out.  But it\'s not -- and you\'ll just drive yourself crazy wondering why it isn\'t working when clearly it should.  What\'s worse is that there are no manuals or help docs anywhere.  Not online, not in print.  There\'s not even a pdf file one can download or even look at.  You are on your own.I know what you might be thinking:  ""Oh, I\'ll just look on the internet.  No doubt someone posted a tutorial ... right?""  Not really no.  The ONLY  two things ""help""  videos tell you how to do are messing with lighting effects and macros.  There are a dozen videos about how to make macros -- which in itself is stupidly complicated -- but there are NOTHING on the internet that explains how to do something simple.  Like bind a single key to one of the side buttons.  There is nothing.  And if you do a search on the problem, all you\'ll find are forum posts with other people complaining about the problem.  But there are no solutions.The big issue people seem to have is that ... let\'s say you want to bind the ""E"" key to Side Button 1.  The default key for Side Button 1 is the number 1.  So, intuitively,  you would think that you could select Side Button 1,  go to the dropdown menu,  select ""Advance"" and then ""Single Key.""  Then tap the ""E"" key and the letter ""E"" replaces the number 1 in the box below the menu.  Then you click ""Apply"" and wow --- done!  So then you decide to assign the ""F"" key to Side Button 2.  You repeat the same process as before and then, again, click ""Apply.""  But when you click on Side Button 1 -- guess what.  That button reset itself so that, once again, the number 1 is assigned to Side Button 1.  Somehow,  the letter ""E"" has disappeared entirely.  When you go back to Side Button 2 -- yep,  same thing.  Now Side Button 2 is now assigned the number 2 and the letter ""F"" has disappeared.  You can assign buttons the keys you want all the live long day, but the moment you click a different button, the last button you changed will reset back to default.  There is NO way to do something as simple as assigning a single key to a button.  And as I said, there are no tutorials or videos or docs that explain this.  The help video uploaders are all in love with their macros and none of them have bothered to give a tutorial on the basics.So unless you already know what you\'re doing -- don\'t bother with this mouse.  The unintuitive software and the complete lack of instructions make this a lousy buy for anyone who isn\'t already well-versed in how to set up profiles.  Oh yeah -- one thing, too, is that you\'ll get all kinds of mystifying pop-ups like, for instance, if you try to change profiles, a pop-up will appear saying,  ""This profile is already in use!""  Yeah.  No idea.  No idea whatsoever.  So unless you want to spend $40 on a three-button mouse, skip this.  I guarantee you will not get it to work unless you already know what you\'re doing.Oh, and did I mention that it crashes?  Yeah -- it does that, too.

I saw the low price and felt it was worth a shot though I had worries. I found none of them were substantialThe first thing that I saw said negatively about it was something about it being slippery. In what I got, it is nothing of the sort.The second bad feedback I saw was that it had negative feedback of both too small and too large. I found it is a great size. The only negative I can give is that the two top buttons on the side would be nicer if further back, but it is fine as it is.I was worried about the buttons. With so many crammed on the side like this, I was worried the size of them would be hard to get the right button. However, the size and way they are shaped and spaced took my fears of this away as soon as I started programming them.The shape of the mouse is OUTSTANDING! I was impressed with some of the shape of the previous one I tried, but, for me, this one put that one to shame on both sides of the mouse.The only thing that was a downside when I first started looking at this one was that it was not wireless. However, it is I nice chord that has plenty of extra length.The only other thing to discuss is the software. It is not hard to find it and it runs easily. The one thing I will throw a tiny complaint at is in how the settings work. When programming even a single button, you have to record, stop, and apply each one. It is not a real issue, but it took me a moment to figure out what I needed to do to make it stick. The other issue is the lighting. The color spectrum in the programming does not match what will be on the mouse. I was able to get the color by trial and error instead of going by the spectrum they give, but it was a little annoying. Other than that, it works nicely and provides all the potential settings I would ask for.Ultimately, I can say this is the mouse I've been wanting ever since I started gaming. I love it!"", ""I purchased this mouse (M811) to play StarField. StarField controls suck, and I wanted a mouse with multiple buttons to rebind some of the keys.For a simple purpose like this, no need to use the Redragon software: you can bind the keys directly in game (they'll appear as mouse1~mouse10).I also noticed that the cursor speed is different from my office mouse: this helped me when piloting the ship in-game. I didn't know this was a thing.As to the colors, they can be adjusted easily with the Redragon software and they are very pretty.I have to say I never had a gaming mouse before and I'm just a casual gamer, so I can't speak for the elite, but so far I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase."", 'Good, just have to get the program for doing, but need winrar,  but need to go to web site and nothing telling that.', 'I have owned at least 10 different mice over the years. From Razer, Corsair, Cooler Master, etc. This is by far the best mouse I have owned.', 'It was very easy to download the software and customize the buttons.

The aluminum frame and layout of the board create a metallic acoustic mess that will leave you with pingy noises when typing and a slight ring when using your space bar as the rattle from the stock stabilizers drives you nuts. HOWEVER, if you buy foam inserts for the board (i bought mine off of StupidFish for $29 plus shipping) it MASSIVELY improves the sound quality. I also opted for new stabilizers (Durock plate mounted stabilizers were bought through amazon for less than $3) and lubed them and these made a huge difference in my experience with this board.If you're willing to spend the extra, roughly, $35 (depending on what shipping speed you use with StupidFish) then this board is worth it.

It even comes with some foam inside of the case, which isn't the best foam, but it works.I would buy this again, especially if it is going for a lower price (PLEASE dont spend $270 on this board), as it is a highly available Aluminum case and hot-swap PCB combo, if you want another option for a TKL with aluminum case check out the Glorious GMMK Pro (I would have chosen that if I liked the format of their keyboard better. it is only slightly less for about the same keyboard)For rebinds I just use Auto Hot Key, since I don't need anything crazy, and AHK is a very powerful language. I do believe that Drop supports flashing the firmware for this keyboard, however.It should be noted however, this board doesn't come with stabilizers (the one I got) and they are clip-on stabilizers.

It didn’t last five minutes. The Kailh Box White switches, which I have had on every mechanical keyboard I have owned prior to this, sounded awful. The case had a terrible sound to it and every stabilizer rattled horribly.I took all the caps back off to inspect the board and case and stabilizers and saw no damage from the keys rattling around that would have been responsible for the rattle. It is just bad design.It is a hot swap board and the ability to swap all of the various parts out is obviously part of the allure, but at the price point of this keyboard I refuse to see how it makes sense given the poor build quality and the fact that you would need to replace every single part. You’d be better off getting the barebones board from Drop and building it out yourself. It would likely be cheaper and miles better.Because of this, I had no interest in exchanging the keyboard for one that was not broken on arrival and just asked for a refund.Separately, I would like to add the first version of this review was blocked because shipment damage is not supposed to be what fuels a review, but understand that this box and keyboard had ZERO shipment damage. There was not so much as a mark on the box and the Drop Ctrl arrives in a box with stiff styrofoam above the keyboard. There is NO WAY for keys to come off without them having been put in the box that way.

It has a whopping 8K pen sensitivity level - a great upgrade from my old Bamboo Fun tablet that had 2K levels (and will no longer be usable due to incompatibility with my computer since Wacom stated they won't make new drivers for it anymore for some reason). I was surprised that this had express keys for its size, and they worked well. Speaking of the size of the tablet, I like that this is small and compact; it's great for travel. The tablet driver software was straightforward to use as well.The computer I am using is a MacBook Air (2019) 13in with 1.6 GHz Dual core, Intel Core i5, 16gb RAM, Intel UHD Graphics 617. At the time of writing this review, it is updated to the latest macOS Catalina v10.15.2. I use Photoshop CC 2019/2020.Initially using the tablet and drawing was a breeze, the pen pressure sensitivity difference from my old tablet was very noticeable - I didn't have to redo brush strokes much to at all because of how I could easily draw strokes with variable widths that I wanted. Blending colors was easy as well through this since I could lightly push the pen on the tablet to smoothy blend or press harder to have my colors blend much less. I was using the oils brush for this.Unfortunately, there were technical complications with the tablet that made my experience unpleasant. Pen pressure, the USB cable, and lag.- The pen pressure is fantastic, but for some reason on the driver software options even when I put the sensitivity all the way to Light, I still have to press a lot for strokes to be at a medium width. I thought that this would make me wear out the nib and scratch the tablet surface very fast over time, which I didn't want.- The USB cable seems to be unstable and needs improvement, or the input plug on the side of the tablet does. The USB-C end would loosen out and unplug from the tablet every so often, and I would have to keep reattaching it. I thought that using a different USB-C cable would help fix this but the tablet doesn't even turn on doing this. I don't know if this is a problem with other people but for mine it seems the tablet's own USB cable is the only thing that can be used with it, and it needs to be improved to work efficiently.- Every now and then the tablet would lag or stop suddenly even when still plugged in, and then it would spazz out in Photoshop. For instance, during the spazz out it would keep making my layer switch the blending mode rapidly. I have to unplug the tablet and back again to stop this. Moreover on the lag: I was first using Photoshop CC 2020, and the tablet would lag with brush strokes like as if I have the Smoothing level all the way up, even though it's at 0. I thought that this wouldn't be a problem when I only have one other program like Spotify or Safari on, but even I had no other program on (even ensuring unnecessary programs weren't running in the background via the Activity Monitor) this issue would still go on. I switched to Photoshop CC 2019, and the issue still happened only until I made it the only program running. It ran smoothly then. I am assuming it is because of how the tablet takes in 8K pen pressure levels and this causes lag, because in comparison, my old Bamboo Fun tablet which has 2K pen pressure levels could run smoothly on Photoshop CC 2019 even while I would video chat on Discord.This may or may not be a con, but for the driver software I found it strange that my computer gave me a warning that the installation file was unknown and potentially malicious software, despite rarely getting this warning from other installation files. I even had to turn off my firewall to get it to start installing. So it would be nice if the driver could be improved in that aspect as well.Normally I would deal with technical issues for tablets if they don't occur often and if I can make a way around them, but I don't think I can for this tablet in the long run. I still give it 4 stars because I do think that this tablet is pretty good for its price (small compact tablet that has 8K pen pressure levels and is compatible with macOS 10.15+) and assume it would run much better on an i7+ computer - I just think that after improvements are made on it, it will be much worth it."", 'Firstly, I\'m not a professional artist (See my first piece!) and am just getting back into fantasy artwork after about a 30 year hiatus (Yikes!)  I wanted something small and lightweight (portable) but with a reasonable amount of drawing area.  I have a Huion 1060 Plus that I use at home but it\'s about double the length and width of the A640 so it wouldn\'t work when out and about.  I also wanted a few programmable buttons (which I didn\'t end up using, by the way.)  So after reading/watching a few reviews I ended up with the A640.  Below I\'ll list the pros and cons I\'ve noticed after about 15 hours of using the device.Pros:1 - Very good working area compared to other smaller tablets.  Most smaller tablets drawing areas don\'t get nearly as close to the edge as the A640.  I think the comparable Huion has about an inch border all the way around with a much smaller drawing area even though the tablet itself is about the same size.2 - Pen does not have a rechargeable battery, nor does it require a battery at all.  I believe this is the direction most newer tablets are going.  It\'s really nice, because I don\'t have to worry about batteries (or charge) if the unit has sat in a shoulder bag for a little while.3 - Tablet is thin enough that It doesn\'t bother my hand when my palm/wrist dangles over the right edge.  My Huion tablet has is half again/twice as thick and if I get to the edge, it kinda hurts my hand. :(And now for the Cons:1- Tablet seems to get a little scuffed up pretty quickly where the pen nib rubs against surface.  I\'ve noticed a bit of glazing in the area that where I normally draw after only 15 or so hours of use.  I tend to press pretty hard when drawing so your results may vary.  Now, I can\'t actually ""Feel"" any of the glazing in use or even with my finger, but I can see it on the tablet surface.  Probably won\'t ever actually cause any issues.2 - Drivers.  When installing the drivers on my laptop, everything went fine, but when installing the software on a machine that had my Huion tablet drivers, I kept getting a Wintab32.dll error.  I tried uninstalling the Huion drivers (as suggested) and even manually removing the drivers.  Still no joy.  The tablet actually works fine with my drawing software (AutoDesk Sketchbook Pro) but I can\'t install the Parblo software to adjust buttons and what not on this particular machine without getting the error.  On a side note, I\'ve contacted Parblo several times about the issue and their customer service has gotten back to me each time within a day with possible ways to fix the issue.  They\'ve sent me another fix which I haven\'t tried yet, so cross your fingers.  Either way, I don\'t really care because I\'ve found that I don\'t really use the buttons with Sketchbook.  And, the pressure sensitivity still works fine, so no biggie.  AGAIN, I\'m guessing the issue with the the OLD Huion drivers wanting to stick around since the software installed perfectly on a fresh laptop.3 - Tiny little con.  Pen could use a little rubbery thingy near the tip to grip onto.  It\'s a little bit slippery.Overall, I\'m VERY happy with the unit.  I\'ve even stopped using the Huion tablet because i don\'t really need the larger drawing surface.  I tend to draw more in short strokes from the fingers/wrist so the smaller working area on the Parblo is more than enough, and it makes the unit very easy to tote around with me, and takes up less desk space when working at home.', 'Sí eres un principiante totalmente neofito en el dibujo o arte digital está tableta será perfecta. No hay duda que por el precio hay otras pocas opciones, es la primer tableta de este tipo que pruebo y me pareció más que perfecta para mí uso.', 'me gusta mucho e realizado muestras gráficas y me a servido muy bien para mi carrera 10/10', ""The packaging was excellent. The product is lightweight as it's made entirely from plastic but that doesn't seem to affect the performance and helps with portability. I like that it uses a USB Type-C cable so I don't have to worry about the orientation of the tablet side jack and in the event that the cord fails they are readily available. The pen is also very lightweight and feels good in my hand and has the benefit of not requiring a battery. Honestly, at this price point, this is a 5-star product. At the time I wrote this review there are no other products that match these specifications in this price range. I am giving it 4 stars because I struggled for a while getting it to work with my MacBook Pro running Mojave. There is an article at https://bit.ly/2VJ3ojT that offers a solution to the issue, however, the daemon mentioned in the article did not exist in the list of programs to grant accessibility privileges to. I was able to navigate to the daemon on my disk at /Library/YJDriver/YJDaemon.app in lieu of checking the box and now it works like a charm. I haven't done exhaustive testing yet but so far so good. I'll update my review if I uncover anything noteworthy as I spend more time using it."", 'this is the perfect digital drawing pad for beginners! it’s easy to set up and use. you can customize your controller buttons to whatever you like (erase, file, delete, pull up keyboard, etc)  however, if you’re drawing,  it is kind of hard to control where your pointer is on screen because you’re hovering the pen over the pad. that’s alright, though. you’re able to use a button as a pointer and that way you won’t have to press down on the pad!very reasonable price, too', 'Solo es importante mencionar que el software aún no es compatible con windows 11 y no es posible calibrar ni configurar la tableta si tienes ese sistema operativo. Aún con ello, windows reconoce el dispositivo y te permite utilizarlo.', ""When I initially bought this I was disappointed because on amazon it had claimed to be compatible with Mac OS and when I received it and went to the website to download the driver, there wasn't a compatible one available for this model of tablet. BUT when I messaged Parblo about it, they got back to me within a day and emailed me a link for the new download within a week! I've been able to use it easily since I've downloaded the driver, and I think it's perfect for a beginner on tablets like myself, especially for those who don't want to shell out a few hundred dollars when they aren't even sure if drawing on a tablet is quite up their alley. Also I love how small it is and I'm planning on crocheting a little case for it to keep everything cushioned and together!"", 'Es frecuente que haga que se ""trabe"" la laptop en la que la uso, y ha dejado un comando de ""Buscando multimedia"" en el proceso de arranque de la laptop, ya la eliminé y la volví a cargar, y no se quita ese proceso...ni modos así trabajo', ""I will start by saying in not an artist. I was looking for a pen mouse and had tried other versions. I find the pen to be very finicky with how I hold it in order to click vs drag. Sometimes I have to rotate the orientation of the pen (hold it at different angles to the pad) and sometimes I have to spin it in between my fingers  to get just the right contact to click. I've tried to pay attention to how I hold it for specific gestures, but it isn't consistent for the same action. I tried to adjust the settings but I 1) can't find info on the user's guide about the options and what they mean and  2) nothing seems to change the way the pen responds. As a result I periodical need to use the trackpad on my laptop, which defeats the purpose of having a mouse.Overall is good enough, I still use it daily. And perhaps my issues are user error... But in that case I wish there was more tech support or a better users guide on their website. I even searched for YouTube videos with very limited success.""]"

Even better is they said they could have put the viper v2 internals into a viper mini and created a lightweight wireless viper mini but instead you get whatever this disappointment is.Don’t buy the wireless cobra.

I keep a wifi dongle plugged into one of the onbaord USB ports so that whatever I connect to, I have keyboard, mouse, and network access. It works fine, but I will say that the trackpad takes a little getting used to. there is a large plastic border that separates the trackpad from the buttons, and the buttons sit up quite a bit higher than the trackpad, so I almost always miss the buttons when trying to click on things because I'm used to the more modern designed trackpads found on today's laptops. I'd still buy this again, but the trackpad is irritating."", 'I wiped it down with a damp cloth and it stopped working.  I know its not waterproof but this is ridiculous.  Also the touch pad buttons are cheap flimsy plastic that tend to stick when pressed.  Over all, it feels like a cheap quality fisher-price toy.caveat emptorEdit: The keyboard touchpad appears to be functioning normally again.  I dont know what it was.  The water did something to it.  I dried it thoroughly but it still wouldnt work for a whole week.  I then bought a different keyboard.  BUt now, after returning my attention to this keyboard, I find that it works thoroughly.  I apologize for the incorrect review.', ""The mouse keys are VERY loud. My coworkers think I'm using a typewriter. But, I bought it for sensory issues because I don't like that my new laptop doesn't have the dual mouse keys so if that's you, you'll love it. It's light so not an issue to carry around but feels kinda cheap for the price. I do notice some keys are sticking after having it for a few months now.(4 or 5)"", '価格に対してちょっと安っぽい作りです。トラックパッドの使い勝手には慣れが必要ですね。ちょっと使いにくいです。キーボードの厚みがあるので、その辺りも使いにくさが出てしまいます。', ""I needed a keyboard for an autogage iin a robot machining cell and I didn't want a conventional keyboard. This one stores in less space and has all of the functions that I needed, plus it has 2 additional usb ports. Love it!"", ""Keyboard has a nice feel, but the trackpad almost doesn't work with 2 finger scrolling. Also, keyboard's too thick. To get thay real laptop feel (to help people who need ergonomic setup), its not great."", ""I didn't expect too much of this little keyboard, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It works well for working on my laptop, as it is easier to type on because I can move it closer to me and it's not at a weird angle.The keys are very responsive and have a nice weight to them.  It was easy to set up, just plugged in the USB and it was ready to go after a few seconds.I wish it had a number keypad included and was just a little bigger for that purpose.  Also, the price seems super high for a small travel keyboard.Overall, I would recommend it if you need a small keyboard for temporary or travel use."", ""So this works out real nice for me. I like that I only need 1 open USB port to run both the keyboard and trackpad, and on the side, I can plug in an additional mouse and USB stick or even portable drive. I've used Perixx products before, and even have a fondness for their large letter keyboard that I purchased for my mom a few years back. I have also purchased several of another model they make that has like an adjustment knob for brightness and changes 3 different colors. Don't remember the exact model, but great keyboard, I remember buying several of them for customers. This is a pretty nice keyboard as well, but honestly, the keys are a little too close for me, and the angle just didn't seem right. But for use as a backup device for like say programming chromebooks and tablets, I love it! Does just what I need it to do, so I ain't gonna gripe too much about key spacing. The extra hub on the side is really what sells this for me. Very useful and functional product."", ""I have no complaints. This keyboard/touchpad combo works great and is in a (relatively) small form factor. While I wouldn't use it for desk-work, it works great with my Raspberry Pi; and I could see it being useful with a mini PC, as well. It's on the pricey side for what it is, but it works well."", ""This keyboard is a definite change from a steadfast size desktop keyboard. This while board was narrower than my Lenovo ThinkPad's built in keyboard, but a bit deeper. There is obviously no numeric keypad (it's meant to save space after all; it's a mini keyboard), but the keys are crammed slightly too close together and I find my hands drifting one or two keys over and ending up mistyping. It worked right away when attached, just the way plug and play is supposed to do.The keys themselves are good, and the keyboard isn't horrible to type on. It's responsive and the included trackpad works as well as one expects. It does have a function lock capability so you can lock the function keys into media station mode instead, controlling volume, playback, etc. with this rather than shift Fn key every time. Nice if you're watching videos I suppose.It's lightweight and thin and since it is sized smaller than the standard laptop, it is a good choice to throw in a backpack or laptop case to have a wired keyboard with you on the go.It is USB A though, so you'd need an adapter to USB C to use with a laptop without the A connector or to cell phones or tablets. Since it isn't much bigger than my Kindle Fire, I might just throw an adapter on it for that and use it when I don't really want or need to lug around my ThinkPad and a tablet will do.It's a nice keyboard and fills a certain role very well. 4 of 5 stars for the issues with mistyping.""]"

I really like the gradient blue and thought it would look nice on my desk.  This is not my first mechanical keyboard, but it is my first from Redragon.Let's start of with what I like.  First and foremost, this keyboard is heavy.  I purchased the heavier option because I don't plan on lugging it around any where.  It'll live on my desk forever.  I like the Cherry Red switches.  They have a great feel to them.  Their response is amazing. I tend to use a light touch, especially with my pinky fingers.  This registers all my inputs well.What I don't like.  I don't like the RBG on the keyboard.  On other keyboards I own, you get a little more control of the lighting.  All the preset look nice and all, but I really just want white as an option.  My other gripe is the frame is all aluminum.  As such, the corners are sharp.  I guess in a pinch, I can bludgeon someone with it.  It would have been nice of Redragon to round of the edges some.  Finally, the cable is a basic UBC-C cable.  I get for this price point you can't have it all.  A braided cable would have would give it a finishing touch that would set off better than the rest.My final thoughts.  The Redragon Bluesiren is a fantastic keyboard for the price point.  It is loaded with plenty of feature for someone looking for a mechanical keyboard.  I was able to get mine on sale, which is even better.  If you are looking for a sub $100 keyboard, I would definitely consider this an option.Pros:All aluminum, heavy weight frameCherry Red SwitchesHot SwappableFantastic color schemeExtra switches, key remover, and switch tool includedCons:Lack of RBG programingSharp corners on frameBasic USB-C cableAlternate function keys/icons are not opaque."", 'A great beginner mechanical keyboard! Great sound and solid build. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to get into keyboards! Only downside is the software download for more control on the rgb and keys gave me some issues to download onto my computer. McAfee and Windows Defender had to be deactivated to download and open the file. Then Webroot said I got a trojan virus from thsi somewhere but it was just the Audio recorder which Webroot then deleted and it Redragon kept having this annoying popup that said they could not find the audio recorder file because it was deleted. I will try redownloading this later when I want to change up my boards color layout! Overall though, even with these technical difficulties with the software, it does not detract from how great this keyboard is!', 'I really liked this keyboard.  It worked great.  I wanted to change the color scheme so I downloaded the software from Redragon.  It was very difficult to download and Norton security kept going off.  When the software was installed the keyboard went dead.  Customer service is great.  They tried to help me install the firmware but I could not get it to download.  Redragon customer service offered to give me a new one.I sent the original back to Amazon and ordered a new one.  I will not install the software, but will use the button on the keyboard to apply any functions.', 'This is an amazing keyboard! It looks even better in person. The only thing this company needs to do now is make a matching mouse with the same color scheme! The only thing missing is a wrist rest. Now maybe my Steam Deck or PS5 controller is having drift issues or I’m just not used to how sensitive the keys are but I did notice that in game I was playing with it I would get input as if I was pressing the WASD keys when I wasn’t it would only happen when I pushing the keys.', 'Very nice feel and great sound.', ""My wife is getting annoyed at how many mechanical keyboards I have, so I got the Redragon wired Bluesiren keyboard for my daughter. While it is not a super high-end keyboard, it is nice and she likes it a lot. The keyboard has a good weight - the aluminum case makes it very sturdy. The switches have a good feel to them. The backlighting is nice with a thin RGB ring around the edge of the keyboard. We haven't tried to adjust the RGB lighting because she is good with the preset lighting.Of course, one of the first things my daughter noticed is that it is a nice soft blue color with keys that have a pastel like ombre effect. She likes that the keyboard does not move around because of the weighted frame, and she has commented that she likes the response of the mechanical keys and ease of use. She uses it as her main keyboard for school and gaming - and has been really happy with it."", ""The keyboard is an excellent product for the price range that it would fall into. Other keyboards of similar cost are much less sturdy and rarely have hot-swap features. Like other Red Dragon products, this keyboard is built like a tank and is quite heavy due to its metal frame. The frame is held together by six side screws and only requires a Phillips head screwdriver to disassemble. The default switches actuation distance is standard if not a bit longer. This makes the keyboard good for gaming but not the most optimal. However, the only players that would notice something like that are looking to min/max their gaming setups. This can be solved later if you choose to by swapping out the keys. The board is more raised than I was accustomed to because I previously used a low-profile keyboard. This made getting comfortable with his keyboard a bit of an annoyance but would be less of an inconvenience if you are swapping over from a traditional keyboard. I found the ergonomics of the keyboard to be its weakest aspect because of its height. My wrists would feel strained if the keyboard was using the stands and even when I wasn't using the stand I found it much more comfortable to pair the keyboard with a wrist rest. The RGB functions of the keyboard work properly but strobed too often and were too bright for my taste so I went with a static color option but that comes entirely down to preference."", ""This is a whale of a keyboard. Like, it's heavy.All aluminum frame with a good bit of heft.Thick foams for sound absorption.Wired with RGB hot swappable switches.Multi tone blue keycaps with shine through.All in all it's a great board if you like fullsize. It is big and it is heavy but it is so nice. I love it honestly. The whole color scheme is really cool, basically white keys on top and darker blue keys on bottom.I've never gotten a redragon board I didn't like. They are all well made. If you are looking for fullsize and all kinds of blue, this might be your board."", 'You can spend a lot of money on keyboards today and even go so far as to custom build your own. That can cost you a lot of money. I needed a solid (important word) keyboard to replace the cheap plastic ones that come with the computer and are found everywhere. Furthermore I needed a WIRED keyboard since I found my 44 oz iced teas blocked the signals from me keyboard at the worst of times.I was predisposed to this brand since I already had a mouse from them that I was quite happy with. Yes, all the colors are fun to watch in the dark, but I am using this more for work than play and I needed a SOLID keyboard that did not rock or creak when I typed. The solid metal construction of this keyboard gave me that.In addition to the built in light show (the characters in every key are transparent and backlit) the outer edge of the keyboard is illuminated as well. You can control these features, but after the initial set up, I have not bothered with them.The keyboard is not as loud as some keyboards, but the travel of each key is good and the feedback from the touch of the keyboard is good. Because of the weight of the keyboard, it does not slide around on my desk. It does feature flip up legs, but I find the layout the right height and angle for me without them.', 'This keyboard has real good weight to it. You just know by picking it up that it’s a well built keyboard. The ease of switching caps is a big plus. I really like this a lot! Definitely recommended']"

If you are picky at all about the key press feeling and don't like mushy keys, then stay very far away from this keyboard. I have had any issues with the bluetooth dropping in the time I've been using it and I really do like the layout, but the keypress feeling is just awful. It's very mushy and the keys have a fair amount of play in them. The backspace key seems to be further away than normal as well. I do really like that they left they have the delete, home, end, page up and down keys as dedicated keys and not a function. I also like that the wrist pad isn't padded."", ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Perixx equals excellence in my opinion. I've used their wireless ergonomic mouse for years now. So I was very excited to see this ergonomic keyboard option. The typing experience is excellent. The keys feel like a professional office keyboard that are responsive and will last. The wrist support is great too - it's plastic, but not too hard; I want a support that will last because I can wipe it off and it won't get a dent in it or anything. The keys will take getting used to. The gap between the two sides is unusual to me; some keys have a larger gap than others. But, I think I need to get used to any new keyboard.

This ingenious device has proven to be an absolute game-changer, providing a hassle-free solution to prevent inactivity-related inconveniences and frustrations.The Mouse Jiggler works amazingly well! It boasts a seamless setup process - just plug it in, and you're good to go. No complex software installations or configurations are required. This simplicity ensures that anyone, regardless of their technical prowess, can enjoy its benefits immediately.What makes the Mouse Jiggler truly remarkable is its ability to mimic human-like mouse movements. This nifty little gadget ensures your computer remains active even during periods of idleness, preventing screensavers and sleep modes from interrupting your workflow. This is particularly useful during long video conferences, presentations, and any other tasks where continuous activity is necessary.Moreover, I've found Mouse Jiggler to be an excellent tool for maintaining productivity while working from home. With this tiny device plugged in, I no longer have to worry about the inconvenience of having to log in repeatedly due to my computer's auto-lock feature. It has significantly improved my workflow efficiency and saved me countless minutes each day.Beyond its practicality, the Mouse Jiggler also excels in its unobtrusiveness. It operates silently in the background, and its compact size means it doesn't take up unnecessary space on my desk. Additionally, it's incredibly energy-efficient, consuming minimal power while providing maximum benefits.Another fantastic aspect is its compatibility with various operating systems. Whether you're using Windows, macOS, or Linux, Mouse Jiggler ensures a seamless experience across platforms, further contributing to its versatility and widespread usability.Lastly, I must commend the customer support provided by the Mouse Jiggler team.

Whether you're a professional, student, or even a casual user, I highly recommend the Mouse Jiggler to enhance your computing experience and bid farewell to idle frustrations once and for all!"", 'Buen producto, cumple con lo descrito, tiene 2 funciones, 1 velocidad donde mueve bastante el puntero con un matron reperitivo, la segunda mueve el puntero de izquierda a derecha aproximadamente 1-2 pixeles, lo que me parece muy útil ya qué siempre lo tengo conectado de este modo y no requiero estar conectándolo o desconectandolo, aveces olvidó que esta conectadoEl material no es tan bueno como esperaba, me da la impresión que en algún momento se va a romper cuando trate de desconectarloDe ahí en fuera lo recomiendo totalmente', 'Grazie a questa chiavetta USB è possibile mantenere attiva la sessione del proprio PC.Con il tasto possiamo selezionare 2 modalità, Modalità spostamento del cursore lenta con LED di colore BLU che permette anche di lavorare con il PC e modalità veloce led Verde che non permette di utilizzare il mouse.Tenendo premuto il tasto la chiavetta si spegne.Testata sia su Windows che su MAC OS senza riscontrare anomali.Viene riconosciuta come un dispositivo composito, quindi non ci sono problemi o anomalie di compatibilità.Recensione completa sul mio canale youtube Ciarly', 'Il prodotto soddisfa le mie aspettative. Ha due modalità di funzione: 1) si muove solo di qualche pixel, in wuesto modo si può usare il mouse normale per lavorare al pc e quando non lo si usa il doongle continua a muovere il puntatore; 2) muove il puntatore del mouse per tutto lo scherma, ovviamente con questa modalità è impensabile continuare ad usare il pc perché il puntatore del mouse non rimane dove lo si punta', 'I bought this and was bit worried that it would work due to the reviews but it was inexpensive, so I gave it a try.  The item has three modes:  OFF, Move a Lot, Move a tiny bit.  I dont see any use for the move a lot mode.  The move a tiny bit mode keeps my screen alive and I can still use my mouse as if this was not on.  The nice thing is I can have this and my mouse working at the same time.  Works as expected.', 'These devices are great! They work perfectly. I bought two, one for my home PC the other for my work PC. My company recently made all kinds of “security updates” including timeouts of 5 minutes with no input. Well, I plugged in this baby and I no longer have to re-logon every 5 minutes or so. I use the minimal movement setting so no one sitting near me has a clue. I highly recommend these for anyone, especially those still working from home where these security rules make absolutely no sense.', 'Great product. Promoted to boss shortly after getting this as they said I was the only employee they could trust as I was always available on teams. Brilliant and as well as that I am now a near pro level golfer due to the extra “work” time I can now put into my game. You could say in fact I’m already a pro as technically I’m already getting paid to play golf. All due to the mouse jiggler. Excellent.', 'This worked perfectly to keep my computer awake while I\'m reading physical paper reports, or while I get a cup of coffee.  It does what I need it to do.  I got this one because it has an on/off button, so that I can turn it off when I don\'t need it to jiggle. However, there are a few things to know about this jiggler.The ""slight"" jiggler mode moves the mouse cursor about once every second.  Sometimes just one pixel to the right, then a second later one pixel to the left.  Other times, it will move the cursor two pixels to the left, then a second later one pixel right, then another second later one pixel right again.The ""random"" jiggler mode, really is not random. It moves in a strange repeating multi triangle pattern where every few loops it gains about 10 pixels to the left and 10 pixels down.  So when you leave it in this mode, one minute later you will find the cursor wiggling around somewhere near the lower left corner of your screen.Also it can be a bit difficult to get used to turning it off and on.  It\'s not that easy to always press and hold the button just long enough to turn it off.  Sometimes I would think it was off, but rather I didn\'t press the button long enough, or maybe I pressed it too long.  It would switch modes and I\'d have to try again to turn it off.', 'Ottimo accessorio per mantenere il PC sempre attivo, indispensabile per eseguire operazioni che richiedno molto tempo di elaborazione e ""soffrono"" nel momento in cui il PC va in stand-by. Si può lasciare collegato anche durante l\'utilizzo in quanto il movimento minimo del mouse (un paio di pixels) non infastidisce minimamente il normale utilizzo del PC.', 'It works. Plug it in any usb port, let windows identify it (as a mouse) and it starts working. If the slight movement annoys you, you can toggle it on and off with a tiny button on the end, but I found it’s tiny movements un-intrusive. NOTE: short press toggles between tiny movements and random large movements, long press switches the device off if it annoys in use.']"

La manufactura, el silencio y la comodidad son de lo mejor, ya me he convertido en fan de Perixx. Creo que revisaré sus modelos de mouse.La calidad es muy aceptable, se siente sólido sin llegar a una sensación de ser indestructible pero se percibe bien plantado sobe el escritorio, ya sea sobre un mousepad o una superficie lisa, los apoyos de goma son muy buenos y nos dejan que el teclado resbale. Su concentrador USB en la parte posterior es algo muy conveniente cuando tienes el equipo algo retirado en el escritorio.Un detalle positivo adicional, ambos teclados no presentan esa curvatura incómoda al centro, que hacen sentir al teclado como levantado en el medio sin dejar que la goma central se apoye como debe ser en el escritorio, cosa que sé por experiencias al haber usado otros teclados delagdos con mecanismo de tijera, aunque los adoro, esto les restó bastantes puntos con el tiempo, más específicamente hablo de mi Cougar 200K y el Cherry KC6000.Lo único que le faltó a este teclado para ser un 10+, es un cable USB forrado en hilo trenzado para completar este paquete, creo que compraré un juego de cables trenzados de 2 metros para ambos teclados.El tiempo y forma de entrega, como siempre, de lo mejor.Muchas gracias, saludos.', ""Couldn't have asked for a better keyboard! This model is truly wired + wireless (Bluetooth) capable. It has a switch on it so I can use it at work wired and still enjoy wireless at my house and to other devices. It's got a white backlight to illuminate the keys in the dark that can go high, low, and off. Scissor keys, so it's quiet and feels like a laptop's keyboard. Plus, it has all the keys of a full size keyboard but in a compact size, about the size of a half-keyboard. I can say the pictures in the posting, while the look similar, if you zoom in on the keyboard the lady is typing on, those ARE accurate representations of the model you're currently viewing. You can see the switch, USB ports, or nothing depending on the model you're viewing. Also, at full charge (I think), it lasted at least 20 hrs in bluetooth mode, not charging. It's self sleeping function hasn't been noticed as an issue or causing a delay when woken up. So far, this keyboard's just about everything I wanted. Only improvements I could think would be RGB backlighting - because it's awesome, and a carrying case, because I travel with this keyboard and there's no good way to hold it without mashing on the keys."", 'I can\'t seem to write a separate review for the keyboard and the cover since they\'re the same item. C\'mon Amazon. So I guess I will combine them.First the cover. It is OK if you just want a cover and it will just sit on your desk. If you have a bluetooth model and plan to use it on your lap, skip the cover, it won\'t be worth it.A few cons: It is very thin. It pretty much ""floats"" on the keys. Basically the key imprints could be deeper. I tend to drag my fingers across keys a lot (like the space bar) and it ends up pulling the cover out of place and it wrinkles up. Again, if the key imprints were deeper and it gripped more, this probably wouldn\'t be an issue.Now the 615B keyboard. I bought this since I wanted to be able to use it away from my desktop when watching Youtube, etc. on my TV in bed. My intention is mostly to keep it in wired mode 98% of the time for normal computer use. One pro is it\'s just a USB keyboard in wired mode which lets me get into my BIOS if needed. This is basically the size and layout of a regular laptop keyboard with the addition of a number pad. Most of my work is on a laptop so transitioning to this on my desktop is pretty natural. I wish this model had either more backlight levels or was just brighter when in wired mode. The built in USB hub is useful for charging a mouse, etc. but I believe it\'s USB 2.0, so don\'t expect very much speed out of it. Key travel feels good to me and it\'s fairly quiet.', ""Fantastic keyboard that ticks just about every box for things I want. I love that it doubles as a USB hub, has backlit keys, and a full number pad. I've used this keyboard just about daily for over half a year and it's worked well. In fact, this review was written with it! The only trouble is that it has a few tiny quirks that take some getting used to. For one, I exclusively use this keyboard in USB mode (rather than bluetooth), but if I forget to turn the keyboard off when it's not in use, it drains the battery regardless. I'm not sure why it uses the battery at all in USB mode, but it's quite inconvenient to have to turn it off after every use or risk the keyboard being unresponsive when I want to use my computer. The battery doesn't last very long either, for what it's worth. It also would've been nice to have dedicated Print Screen & Insert buttons, but that's not a big deal. Overall, I would highly recommend this keyboard, as long as you're willing to put up with some very minor quirks."", 'I like having a slim, low profile keyboard, and wanted one that was backlit and with a number pad.The criticism:This is fairly thin, but much thicker than the low profile compact microsoft keyboard I had been using. The key travel distance is more than what I expected with scissor-switch keys (similar to most oem desktop keyboards) and the keys are too smooth) so there is room for improvement. Most keys are concave, but the bottom row (including spacebar and arrow keys) are convex.The good:With that in mind, the layout is good, having a numberpad is great (and does not make the keyboard size too big), and the backlit keys are nice and easy to read. It comes with fold-down feet for tilting, and that is a plus. The hub is also terrific, and I really like that it has a removable cord. It hooks up to a computer with a USB-C to A cable, but you can use a USB-C to C cable with a tablet or phone.Overall, the typing experience is not my favorite, but the extra functionality makes it a good buy in my opinion.', 'Great keyboard in terms of build quality and functionality. I got teh BT version to connect to multiple devices.I specifically chose this keyboard because sometimes i need to be wired via USB, and most of the BT keyboards do not offer that. This one has a switch for dedicated wired mode, off or BT. Seemed to work in wired mode when set to BT.I am currently connected via a switch/hub, and that might be causing an odd problem of when the PC boos up the keyboard does not wake up. I have to flick the wired/off/BT.Fine for all day typing on. the keys return to place with a clear and steady rebound, with very little wobble, no sense of keys being loose.  The CAPS LOCK light is not under the caps-lock key, but on the top right. Traditional placement but something i have to get used to, and potential to improve. Otherwise the white back light is nice.Perixx customer support is great, they responded by email to my questions about the sleep mode and back light fast. The instructions in the box were lacking that basic operational information.', 'Use it every day.  Key throw and flexibility for various connections is great.  Logitech should take notice.', 'Nice little wired keyboard has rubber anti slip pads and tilting legs. Interface to pc requires ‘A type’ legacy usb port even though the keyboard end is usbc. It included the cable with c on one end for keyboard and a on the pc side. If you only have usbc on your pc you will need an adapter not included! Unboxing shows it seems to work well and is a nice compact layout if you have that need.', ""From the beginning didn't understood about light indicator, because it showed all the time red light, that indicates that it is not charged, but next day everything was ok ;) works perfectly, quick respond, quite, backlit works perfectly, the only one problem, but that's not a minus, that there is now charge percentage indication, but still good ;)"", ""Some of you know how tough it is to find a backlit keyboard with USB hub much less a wireless option.This keyboard has exceeded my expectations. Keyboard action is excellent, two brightness levels for the baclite is just right, lightweight.Only one complaint, it doesn't recognize my Iphone or at least not in the C-port.""]"

Others took up too much desk space, squeezing my mouse movements into a small space, or they frustrated me by not having forward Delete keys, or dedicated arrow keys, or it couldn’t be used without being plugged in (I like to chat with others during movies as I lean back taking my keyboard away from my desk), or it had very poor lighting of the characters so even when ‘lit up’ I still couldn’t see where anything was.  I had to hit a number key to see what it was while keeping my other hand on the Backspace button.  Despite colorful backlighting underneath the keys, the keys themselves did not have enough light.  SO …  FINALLY!  I’m so happy to get exactly what I’ve been searching for:  Small size leaving lots of mouse movement room, number keys separate from F keys, Del and Backspace both, Arrow keys in their own little spot, and large characters that really light up so you can see them in total dark - without being blinded by light from under the keys.  Watch the video, where I bring in my other colorful ‘lit’ keyboard, which is even harder to use in real life without the camera’s help.  This Perixx Periboard 732 (or 732B, I’m not sure) is perfect for me!  The keys are quiet and have a definite tactile click-feel but without the loud clacky clacky sound.  It sits up a little in the back, for better look and usefulness.  As for lights timing out:  (1)  Unplugged, not using it, they went out after 36 seconds.  (2)  Unplugged, using it every 5 or 10 seconds, the light stayed on past two minutes when I figured it would stay lit as long as I was using it.  (3)  Plugged into the recharge cable, not using it, they went out after 36 seconds, same as when unplugged.  Probably a good feature, to turn it off if you haven’t needed it for that long.  Even after the light goes out, the characters are so large and so white I can see them even in very little light.  I figure plugged in and using it every 30 seconds or so they would stay on forever.  …  I’m loving the size and extra keys and lights where they should be.  It arrived in only 2 days, and that was during holiday rush (ordered Dec. 22, arrived Dec. 24)  So far there is no downside to this unit.

Many people will be aware that Slack uses some algorithm to decide if you are inactive and flags you as such after 30 minutes. Slack's ability to report on user inactivity is also used by many companies to monitor you.So, I have tried tools (like Caffienated) to keep my laptop alive, and these work for most things, but Slack still tags you as offline after 30 minutes. So I bought this device.Couldn't be more simple, plug it in and it just works. By default it moves the mouse by a couple of pixels every few seconds. You can press the button to put it into a more radical random movement pattern, or long press the button to turn it off.In the default mode, I actually leave it running all the time, so I don't need to remember to turn it on when I leave my laptop. To be honest I rarely notice the mouse movement; I'm a fairly intensive windows user and spend time in may apps, lots of excel etc, and the automated movement does not get in the way. If you do a lot of graphics work and need fine control of the mouse, you would probably need to turn it off.Improvements? Well, USB-C would be nice, and a size reduction too. If it could be the size of a Logitech Nano receiver, that would be perfect. Finally, I would lose the LED, it just draws attention to it, and it's not really required."", 'Amazing product', 'Received exactly as expected. Small, sleek and subtle. Works perfectly on devices. The C-port adapter is an added bonus I didn’t realize was needed for other devices that only have a usb port. The price is pretty good compared to the actual mouse version that I was going to purchase. All around great buy!', 'Works as described, very happy with it!']"

ProtoArc and Logitech trackball mice sometimes makes me use my pinky finger to grab the side of the mouse unintentionally and I end up noticing it when my pinky starts to hurt. This one from Perixx, however, is fat and rounded on the right side, it keeps my hand very comfortable.But, I guess making everything perfect is too much to ask. The ball moves a lot in the lot that it makes so much noise and the curser constantly moves and makes me click wrong.---I am disabled and I spend 22 hours a day in bed reclined. So it's so much easier to use a trackball mouse than the common laser one. I had been using the Logitech trackball for 7-8 years (when I used to be able to sit at the desk), and I've been using the ProtoArc for the lat few months, so I'm not new to trackballs. I even have some experience with the index finger trackballs. The ball in this Perixx is definitely moving way more freely than the others. Perhaps it might work better in a month or so when it gets dirty (all of you trackball users know what I'm talking about lol)."", 'I generally like Perixx keyboards, but the build quality of the PERIMICE-720 is definitely a step down from my old Logitech trackballs. Ball tracking was initially a little rough but seems to be smoothing out with use. Appears to run on little plastic ball-bearings rather than pads like the Logitech. Been using Logi trackballs for decades. Still have and use most of them, so we’ll have to see how long the Perixx lasts. (Windows 10 actually still works with my 30+ year old serial Trackman lol)My biggest gripe is the 2.4ghz reception is atrocious. Purchased the wireless version specifically to use on my couch with my HTPC, which is less than five feet from where I typically sit. Receiver was placed in a front USB port and the PC is not behind a cabinet door. Nothing, nada, zero, zilch…. Fortunately I built the pc with a Bluetooth receiver, because that works fine. Just can’t wake the PC from standby with the mouse anymore.', '結論としてはM575を買う方が幸せ。ボールのスムーズさと安定性が劣ります。高さを変えられたりするので、そこは良かったですが、筐体が若干安っちかったりするので、所有欲満たす以外の実用面考えると微妙です。自宅と会社でM575とそれぞれ使ってましたが、こちらが壊れたのでM575を2代目検討中', 'Ero indeciso se prendere il logitech m575 o questo perixx perimice 720. Ho scelto questo perché aveva la possibilità del tilt su due angolazioni con l\'inserimento dello spessore fornito nello scatolo (cosa simile al logitech mx ergo plus) e anche per dare fiducia ad un brand europeo e nuovo per me a differenza della più rinomata logitech.Il mouse funziona bene la trackball scorre in maniera fluida e tutte le connessioni sono affidabili, sia con il bluetooth con il dongle usb.I punti che mi hanno fatto pendere per il reso sono due:- Non Impeccabile qualità costruttiva, non nella rigidità, o usabilità del mouse, sebbene la rotella non sia il massimo, bensì nel feeling del mouse al tatto. È fatto interamente di plastica lucida non matte e non gommosa, il che rende il mouse immediamente sovraprezzato.  Peccato- I rialzi di plastica a mio avviso sono stati pensati in modo sbagliato o comunque non con l\'idea di inclinare il mouse verso destra per aumentarne la ""verticalità"" bensì aumentarne forse l\'angolo di tilt, nel senso che ""impennano"" il mouse il che però crea un angolo strano nel polso che rende il tutto molto meno ergonomico.', 'This mouse is comfortable and easy to use.

However, what irritates me the most is that the button below the scroll wheel is soooo in the wrong place for me...I keep accidentally pressing it while in games and it takes me out of the game which causes me to lose. If I could disable it, I would in a second. However, this mouse has zero software to support it and, even if it did, the website support download won't load because antivirus software shows it as a trojan. Sigh...even if it is a bit large, I would still like it...if I could find a freaking way of disabling that stupid button. Oh...the the two buttons to the left of the scroll wheel don't do anything. Fortunately, I never use those buttons anyway...never have."", 'Necesitaba probar un trackball dado que tengo problemas de codo de tenista y del túnel carpiano, y aun teniendo un ratón ergonómico quería ver si con un trackball me iba mejor.

Se fija muy bien a la mesa, no baila. Va a pilas con lo que es un plus, de verdad, y más cuando las hay recargables. Es muy ergonómico con tres posiciones, así que otro más.

Vielen Dank.', 'I replaced my Logitech M570 wireless mouse, that lasted me almost two years. I remember when a Logitech lasted me years even with gaming action, these days its getting hard to find anything that will last a year.So I wanted to try something else this time. I noticed this, the German design is what cause my attention and made me pick this of all others, German or European Quality is normally great. Also, the extra angle adapters for a more ergonomic hold seemed great, I buy trackball mouses to save space on the desk and more importantly reduce symptoms of carpel-tunnel, and once you get used to using a trackball you will never go back to a hoover-mouse again.So, other reviewers says this one is a bit big, I don\'t find that to be a problem since i makes it easier for the entire hand to rest easy on the mouse while using it, that in my opinion feels like a am getting less fatigue in the fingers, smaller mouses makes your right 2 fingers either constantly grip the mouse or sort of hang on the side of the mouse, but with this you can let the hole hand be a part of the action without actually gripping the mouse, makes sense? to me that feels better, again once you get used to the new grip.The feel of the mouse is sturdy but yet somehow a plastic feel due to the glossy plastic, I did like the surface touch feel better on the Logitech, its not a deal breaker. Button presses feels solid and responsive, I didn\'t need to get the drivers to make this work, I did turn down the DPI to 400 on the button under it and I am happy where the cursor speed is now, I did however get the driver from their webpage just so I could change the button settings more appropriate for gaming. I also tried to replace the trackball to compare the scroll feel from the Logitech ball and this ones ball, other reviewer said it felt ""scruffy"", I cant say that I feel a big difference, but I did save the trackball from the Logitech and that\'s installed in the mouse now, I guess it doesn\'t hurt to have 2. So, I am happy not to have to use the hoover-mouse which is my backup for when my trackball mouses die on me, but so far I am pleased with this one and I am actually happy about how the bigger size made my carpel tunnel fingers ease up a bit, So this was so far worth the greens, now time will time how long it last.', 'ho dato solo tre stelle su alcune voci perchè è poco adatto ad un mancino', ""I have been using Logitech trackballs for more than a decade now. Switching to a regular mouse is now unthinkable because of the stress a regular mouse puts on my hand and fingers.When the Logitech MX Ergo broke within 2 years of buying, I had to buy a new trackball. All the Logitech options, including the M575, were too expensive. I thought I'd give this unknown brand a try. It's been just as good as the Logitech ones I have used in the past, if not better.GOOD:1. The scroll wheel can be moved sideways for horizontal scrolling. (Yay!)2. The size and dimensions are comparable to the Logitech ones so the transition was easy.NEUTRAL:1. I like the white colour, but I am not a big fan of the glittery trackball.2. It's wired, and I actually like it. Far better than having to change batteries every once in a while.If you are on the fence about buying this one just because it's an unknown brand, I encourage you to give it a try. You may end up ditching Logitech going forward."", ""I love this mouse for the trackball and it works better than ones I could buy locally.However, it gunks itself easily so the trackball sticks with debris and won't work as intended.There is no browser scrolling like with a regular mouse's middle mouse button.

It does have buttons to quickly jump windows though."", 'Excellent height adjustment - Takes a little to get used to - not good for heavy games.', 'Uso trackball desde hace más de diez años. Actualmente tengo dos Logitech inalámbricos y otro marca Elecom. Este Perixx PERIMICE-520W está a la altura de cualquiera de ellos según mi experiencia. Llevo con él cuatro meses usándolo intensivamente para jugar al Minecraft y en ofimática, y estoy muy satisfecho. Espero que los interruptores duren más que los de algunos Logitech.Por último un consejo a los que empezáis con estos aparatos. No tiene mucho sentido comprar un trackball inalámbrico para una mesa de escritorio. Es un dispositivo fijo y no se mueve como un ratón convencional. Sin embargo, para el salón, para usarlo desde el sofá, creo que no hay nada mejor que un trackball inalámbrico. Lo puedes apoyar literalmente en cualquier sitio (manta, barriga, ...) y a funcionar con total precisión.', 'Ich brauchte das Gerät als Ersatz für eine (nach mehr als 10jähriger Nutzung) nicht mehr funktionierende Trackball-Maus eines Markenherstellers. Dort gibt es das Gerät leider nur noch kabellos, was ich nicht haben wollte.Die Perixx-Maus macht einen deutlich weniger wertigen Eindruck. Der Trackball läuft etwas weniger geschmeidig, aber alles funktioniert auf Anhieb. Ob man acht programmierbare Tasten braucht? Ich sicher nicht.', ""Ottimo mouse per coloro che vogliono tenere la mano ferma. Sfera precisa come anche la rotella scroll. Addirittura ci sono due basi mouse montabili se si vuole regolarne lo spessore. Prodotto consigliato per l'ottimo rapporto qualità/ prezzo."", 'I have the wireless version of this mouse in black, but I wanted to get a wired trackball mouse to save having to change the batteries (and it doesn’t exactly need to move on the desk). I tried many of the other models from ELECOM and Kensington but the Perixx was the best ergonomically for me – not perfect, but the least RSI of all the trackballs I tried. This is such a personal thing you really just need to try them. The Perixx is big which suits my hands, and the tilt options are nice too.The black version of this mouse has many more reviews, but for some reason the white one was cheaper, and it matches my new Moonlander keyboard, so I was happy to get it in white. The plastic looks a bit cheap, very shiny, but it’s a minor thing. Otherwise it’s just like the black one.I’ve had no issues with trackball smoothness, no external software needed on Mac OS. Wish the DPI switch was on the top, and had more options. Horizontal scroll wheel movement is mostly useless, it moves so slowly and is purely on/off in each direction.I like that you can swap the Perixx trackballs – I put the grey one on my black mouse, and the purple one from that on the white mouse. They even sell extra colours if you’re feeling particularly extravagant.So in summary, not perfect, but the best trackball mouse for my hands.']"

At first, I thought I had to buy a tablet just to do written annotations to teach on zoom, but a friend recommended me this and I gave it a shot. No regrets! Saved me alot of money."", 'I have wanted a Parblo for a long time and settled on the A610 pro due to its size and hotkeys. I routinely use a Windows 10 laptop, and switch between Easy Paint Tool SAI, Photoshop, and Clip Studio Paint.The drivers from the Parblo website were really easy to install. I had no issue setting the tablet up and pressure sens worked immediately. After adjusting the sens of the stylus and hotkeys, I tested the tablet in Photoshop (which did NOT require Windows Ink in order to work properly which was a relief!!), then Clip Studio Paint, and finally Easy Paint Tool SAI. I did not experience any drop in pressure, nor delayed feedback from hotkeys. Everything worked wonderfully!The tablet itself has a nice matte surface that is a delight to draw on. The hotkeys on the tablet and the switches on the stylus had great feedback and did not require too much or too little pressure to disturb my painting routine.Removing and reattaching the USB cord did not mess up the driver nor require a restart. When my computer was in sleep mode and woken, the tablet did not respond until I disconnected the USB and reattached it. This wasn’t an issue to me but I thought it good to mention.The stylus is battery-free and does not have an eraser end. I do not often use eraser ends anyway, so again, this detail was not important to me. The tablet also offers both a right-handed and left-handed mode.Each hotkey, including the stylus switches, are reprogrammable. The default settings are quite spot on, so I did not need to change much.The stylus stand has a really solid weight that won’t knock over if you’re like me and set your stylus down a lot. It also holds 8 replacement nibs inside. While the nibs are the standard plastic-like texture, there are no other nib textures offered. So if you are used to the alternative nibs such as the flexible painter’s nib, rubber tipped nib, or charcoal nib, these are not available. I particularly have a fancy for the plastic default nibs, so i quite like the natural drag. I feel the matte surface more than makes up for the lack of nib variety.Considering the price, I would say this tablet is well worth it. The quality feels durable and Parblo is a great brand for beginners, hobbyists, and professionals. It’s just a matter of preference!!After working on the tablet, I did not notice any immediate wear or issues. I tend to work in bursts of 3 hours at a time. The tablet held up well! I am very happy with this product! You can review my images to see the tablet itself, a pressure and blend test, and finally a small project to test its functionality. Both of the tester images were made in Easy Paint Tool SAI.', ""I was bothered by scuffing and scratching that seemed to accompany every stroke I made. My first thought was maybe there was a thin layer to peel off. But, having a light touch, and being afraid to scratch the device, I was too careful when trying to peel anything away. Today finally I gave it another try, and there was indeed a film.So now the tablet feels amazing to write on.My only remaining issue is that there seems to be no general way to adjust pressure sensitivity outside of drawing software. If I could figure that bit out, I see no reason this won't be a 5/5.It feels like a dream to write on."", 'Received this item quickly and has been really pleased with the performance 👍🏼', 'Debo reconocer que me ha hecho útil estos últimos días para mis trabajos, tiene un platico que protege de rayaduras que se formó globitos de aire y eso terminó arruinando dicho protector, no siento la confianza de retirar el protector teniendo en cuenta que a penas llevaba pocos días usando la tableta, vi que estaba rayada, se que esto es un producto delicado pero por dios, se supone que debo realizar trabajos mas rápidamente y de forma precisa y creo que para un trabajo de ese modo no sería recomendable, recomiendo solo si es para gente que se toma su tiempo para hacer sus ilustraciones o aquellos que recién están aprendiendo, lo que desearía es que este producto tenga su driver para Linux (en especial distribuciones Debian como Ubuntu) y así poder usarlo en pcs con esos sistemas operativos, se lo agradecería mucho que cumplieran mi sugerencia.', 'Bought it for my 13 year old nephew for Christmas and he LOVES it.

Huion's inspiroy wh1409 v2 and Deco pro were my go to, watched many review s about them but the durability and the wheel feature made me go to Deco Pro, and yes the price of the stylus which wh1409 comes with are more costly than the xp pen's that's a factor too. The stylus of xp pen doesn't mean bad quality than the huion's pw500 stylus, it's build quality is good, has a little weight which is perfect, pressure sensitivity is perfect, you can tweak as you want from the software, using the software is very easy, you can customise your settings and save individualy for different softwares and it works perfectly.  I was using wacom Bamboo medium size tablet before buying deco pro, i can say one thing which i struggled when i first got the tablet was the size, wacom's medium size was portable and also lighter than the deco pro medium size tablet. I dont use the switches the tablet has, because somewhere i have a fear in my mind its not wacom and has huge price difference between a intuos pro and deco pro. So company would have sacrificed some where in the quality, and it's easy to cost cut in switches quality so i avoid using them, but i totally use the rollers it has and am loving how easy it made my work session controling brush sizes or zooming canvases or rotating canvases.  So in conclusion i will say buying deco pro will not disappoint you, and please stop comparing with wacom intuos pro, your primary need is a tablet, through that you can create your imagination concepts on you pc and phone, that work this product can produce and it's not a cheap builded product but yes comapare to wacom it's slim and you can say little cheaper. There are many aspiring artist who will be thinking for buying their first tablet for them buying intuos pro can be unthinkable.

I think thats normal for the 1st time user.Now if you would ask why I brought it for vdo editing... Ans is scroll wheel , the touch wheel & for those shortcuts which is damn good for scrubbing timeline, nest/compound clips, after effects short cuts & little bit hlpful for drawing curves , masking out & all these. And I\'m using their beta driver with new UI, which has more fuction than the stable released one.Tab wise..it\'s too huge. As U can see I have a quite large desk, but this thing is same as a full size keyboard & see this front of a 32"" display.Now usages wise still I\'m practicing. Sometimes pen is annoying. I can\'t stop /disable some features...but I think that\'s the function of the pen... Rest as said..it\'s huge, sturdy, made out of metal, lightweight & I\'m extremely happy with my 1st purchase dhring amazon sell.For drawing artists I would say it\'s a large size..so if ur looking for a large one for utilizing every inch of ur workspace (for retouching, drawing, illustator) it\'s a must buy product in this price range. Additionally, u will be getting glove, otg, 8 pen nibs...what else at 11k?Maybe Wacom is better (as I have heard, but also heard that will teardown pen nibs so fast)..but being a beginner I\'m completely satisfied & needless to say service provided bg amazon is beyond expectations.So definitely I will recommend this even if ur, not a beginner.', 'dont know about professional work but for a beginner like me,it is the best.it has extra features than deco 03 and quality is also good.though buy a protector for this from xp pen website,i have just used it for 4-5 days not even full hard and scratches started appearing.', 'Aparentemente apenas o cabo não está funcionando, mas  vou precisar de um pouco mais de tempo com ela para avaliar melhor, visto que ela acabou de chegar.Se possível gostaria de receber um cabo novo', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0I was excited about this tablet but let down over the low pressure of the pen.The overall feel is nice and the ample space is great at this price point, however when drawing or sculpting in 3D you want the pressure sensitivity to be as accurate and easy as possible.

And the cap that can be used as a stylus stand keeps falling so don't keep it in the cap. It might fall and roll down your desk.2. Because of such high levels of pressure sensitivity, to reach 8000 something, you gotta press pretty hard and that might damage the tablet or the nib.

I do a lot of ten key input for work and I'm currently working from home so I still needed a number pad for quick data entry.I originally purchased a wireless mechanical numpad with blue clicky keys. Although it worked, it had several things going against it:* Blue clicky switches which were loud especially in comparison to my tactile keyboard.* Full height and no stand which made it uncomfortable and awkward to use.* Bulky - pretty large case for a numpad* Normal '+' key was cut in half and replaced with a '-' key for the top part and a backspace key where the normal '-' is located which was super annoying as I kept deleting stuff. This appears to be common on stand alone numpads but doesn't conform to a regular keyboard.So I looked for a low profile Kailh brown switch numpad if it existed and found this one. I got it yesterday and it's a really good match for my keyboard. I'm happy with my purchase but if they ever come out with one that has the following I'd probably buy that too:* Slightly longer (more depth) to match the size of my keyboard.* Wireless* Ability to turn off LEDs* Slightly taller to match the height of my keyboard.All in all though it's super quiet and feels good when using it. It's quieter than the membrane keyboard I used to have."", ""Likes:1. Works out of the box. No drivers or software needed.2. Switches feel great and keycaps don't bottom out when used.Neutral:1.

The risks of an order-of-magnitude error outweigh the time lost having to press 0 twice."", 'I have to say, getting this thing was a serious suprise in how much better than I thought it would be. The brown switches are nothing to rave about if you are used to custom keyboards, but for a 35 dollar numpad they feel great! The look is professional (instead of an icky ""gamer"" aesthetic) and the backlight substantial. The kickstand feels solid and gives a good angle and remains low profile. The buttons are quite useful, although I would have preferred a calculator button somewhere on it as that is what I mainly use a numpad for. For myself, I would have preferred the big 0 button like most numpads have, however this is dealable and I\'m certain accountants would like it a good bit. The build quality is better than I thought, although not solid aluminium or anything, it has a solid frame and build. Cannot recommed enough!', 'Those are not kailh brown but kailh choc brown. Theses are low profile switches that does not fit regular cherry style keycaps.Other then that the numpad has great quality besite the cable which is not usb c.']"

I absolutely love my Artist Pro 15.6” and never had any major issues with it, just a couple minor hiccups that I’ll state later. Over time, my workflow became cramped, and I needed more room, so when I saw an XP-Pen tablet available, I decided it was finally time to upgrade.Set-up:I prefer my tablet to be on a VESA mount, so we started by putting the tablet on the one I already had. Overall, the process was fine. I would say that it was best as a two-person job, though. One person held the tablet while the other screwed the tablet to the mount and when adjusting tension in the arm to hold up the hefty tablet. The only real issue I had was with the screws that came with the tablet. When we used them, the tablet didn’t feel secure in the mount, so we used our own screws, and it felt a lot more secure. The screws seemed to be more for the stand that comes with it instead of a VESA mount, so if you want to mount it, make sure you have other screws just in case.Honestly, I didn’t need to do much calibration at first. The pen worked perfectly fine out of the box, so I didn’t need to touch the pen calibration yet, though later I had to do this multiple times– that which I’ll get into. The most I had to calibrate was adjusting the colors on the screen. No matter how much I adjusted the settings on the tablet and my computer, the color was always way too bright; light colors that I previously could tell apart were now blended together. This was something I didn’t have an issue with my old tablet. I had to go into my computer’s graphic card settings to adjust further, and after that it was fine.First impressions:- Having such a large workspace is weird at first after coming from a small tablet in comparison, but I quickly got comfortable with it and I love how much room I have now.- With that being said, the offset of the pen is something that still bothers me to this day. It always seems to be at least slightly off of where the pen nib is, and it’s more noticeable when I’m working with a very small pen size in my drawing program. This was something I never had with my old tablet, so I’m not sure if this is normal with such large display tablets, since this is my first experience with one. I did contact XP-Pen support about it, and they said it was normal. If anything, I just need to adapt to it.- The buttons on the top press easily with no issue. One thing I had an issue with my old tablet since the beginning was the buttons wouldn’t always work on the first press, but these work just fine.- The screen feels similar to the Artist Pro 15.6” with that smooth but ever so slightly textured feel.- The anti-glare layer on the screen works as expected.- There’s no input lag as well.First week:The first issue I had was on the second day with the USB-C to USB-C cable that comes with the tablet. I went to adjust the cords to be more pushed down the hole in my table, but in doing so made the USB-C/C become slightly unplugged in my computer for some reason. After plugging it back in, I got a Windows pop up saying there was a malfunction in the USB. Restarting the computer did nothing to help, so I changed it out with the USB-C to USB-A cable that also comes with the tablet, and then it was fine.Throughout the next few days, the tablet overall performed as expected. The only issue I had that continuously happened, as I mentioned earlier, was the pen calibration. After the first day, suddenly any tool I use was majorly offset to be comfortable with. I’ll go through the calibration process, it looks decent for a while (or at least as close to the center of the pen nib that won’t drive me crazy), until it’s either suddenly offset again a day or two later, or it gradually becomes offset, and I have to calibrate it all over again. In the tablet settings, I disabled the Tilt setting to see if that helps reduce the offset, but I’m not sure if it did much.Continuing with the pen itself, the buttons on the pen and the settings don’t always work with me. I set up the buttons to be an eyedropper and a pen/eraser in my drawing program, and it works… okay. The eyedropper seemed to act picky for when it wanted to actually work, and the pen/eraser even now still doesn’t work the way I want too. It switches to the eraser just fine, but even though the pen is set to P like it is in Clip Studio Paint, it just switches back to whatever tool I used previously. Sometimes nothing at all would happen with both buttons, but the screen would still show the keys that were “being used”. The tablet settings are kinda finicky too, as even though I saved the pen settings I want in my drawing program, it completely deleted the setting.Second week:Here’s where suddenly I had the most issues in one day. My pen loses all pressure right from the beginning, and restarting Clip Studio and even restarting the computer did nothing at all. I had to go into the tablet settings and turn on Windows Ink, and it went back to normal, which I don’t remember if I had it on or off to begin with. I occasionally had pen pressure issues with my previous tablet, but it would either quickly resolve on its own or it would be fine after closing and reopening the drawing program.Later on, I go to change the canvas size in my drawing program, and suddenly the cursor goes absolutely crazy; jerking down to the bottom corners of the tablet when I tried to move, doing right-clicks (mostly on the task bar, making the context menus pop up repeatedly) even though I’m not touching my pen nor my mouse. Trying to move the mouse to close out of the canvas setting was extremely difficult because of how it was acting. I had to unplug the tablet entirely from the computer to make it stop so I could close the pop-up. It seemed back to normal after plugging it back in… until I needed to change the canvas size, and it started all over. If I move my drawing program to my computer monitor and go to change the canvas size it works perfectly fine, only when I do it on the tablet is when it goes crazy. The thing that confused me is that I did the exact same thing a few days prior and it worked perfectly fine. I made sure everything was updated– graphics card, tablet driver– and it continued to act up. I contacted XP-Pen support about this and they’ve been super helpful with trying to figure out the cause. As of posting this review, they don’t think it’s a driver issue but a hardware issue with this specific tablet. I’m going to be switching it out and get another one to see if that is the case. I'll see if I need to update this review after I try out the replacement.Third week: Nothing new happened since getting a couple driver updates after communicating with XP-Pen. I haven’t had many issues with offset as long as I calibrate it *just* right (taking a couple tries at times), and there’s been no problem with the pen sensitivity, so I’m able to go about my work just fine. Whenever I need to change the canvas setting, I just move my drawing program over to my computer monitor so I don’t have to deal with what happens when I do it on my tablet.Overall, this is a great tablet and I've been enjoying the upgrade from my older and smaller one. Just keep in mind with this being a new product, it needs more time to get the drivers updated to fix any major issue or common bugs. The technical issues I’ve had have been annoying at best, but has occasionally affected my workflow. It's very possible that I just got a tablet that has more issues than others. If you don’t want to deal with any issues and want a tablet that works perfect right out of the box, I would wait a while before purchasing this tablet to give it time to reach that point. I am very optimistic for this product and think it's a great tablet for this size and quality for this price."", ""I bought this display a few months back to replace my old Bamboo. Going from a tiny tablet to a huge pen display like this is quite the upgrade, and I've enjoyed it quite a bit.The build quality is pretty decent. The stand that comes attached does seem to have a little give when I press down on the display, however I haven't personally had this cause any problems when drawing. A more noticeable problem is that the Menu button on the bottom of the display occasionally fails to register, though I don't find myself having to use the button much anyways. The materials seem fairly high quality, nothing feels especially cheap or fragile. I was a bit concerned that the input/output ports facing downwards would be a problem, and while it is slightly inconvenient to plug/unplug cords, there's enough space between the ports and the desk that I'm not concerned about wires getting damaged from being bent too far. I also consider it a plus that the device has separate ports rather than using a proprietary, converged cable as some pen displays have as those tend to be prone to failure and are far less convenient to replace.The display is quite large. On one hand, this is nice because it allows for a large drawing surface which means you can more easily make use of your entire arm for drawing rather than over-relying on your wrist. On the other, you'll need to ensure you have ample desk space available. The adjustable stand on the back takes up a lot of space, and it will jut out farther as you adjust the screen to a more shallow angle. The stand is easy to adjust and has a good range, allowing the screen to be nearly perpendicular or parallel to the desk. The display has a standard mount so I suppose other stands or a monitor arm could also be used.The screen is of good quality. The surface is glossy, which results in some reflections and glare. Additionally, drawing on it occasionally causes some squeaky noises. The glossy screen does provide a smooth surface for drawing though, and a matte screen protector can be applied, though matte screens come with their own cons anyways. The LCD panel is defect-free and looks great. It has near-perfect viewing angles as advertised. The colors are fairly good, better than my laptop's panel and my other monitor anyways. It accepts HDMI, VGA, and DVI input so there's a great amount of compatibility.For the purpose of drawing, it functions just fine. It lacks fancy features, namely tilt detection, but for basic functionality I haven't had any problems. I'm able to produce nice smooth lines, even when making rapid strokes such as when hatching. There is a bit of parallax and lag as is to be expected, but it's not ever so bad that it's caused me any problems. Compared to drawing on a traditional/screenless tablet, drawing on a pen display feels a lot more intuitive. The pen has a nice shape and has a nice rubbery material around the grip, and the buttons are well placed. I haven't had the battery die yet even as I've barely charged it. The display also comes with a drawing glove which is cool. It isn't exceptionally high quality but it has held up so far and I like the feel of the material.One thing I was a bit worried about when buying this was the support for Linux based operating systems. Tablet support is a bit spotty for Linux, however XP-Pen has released Linux drivers. Initially they didn't work, but after contacting support they were able to get the drivers updated and now they work just fine. The support team was polite and helpful. I'm very happy that XP-Pen is willing to support Linux.So overall I'd say that this is a very solid option if you're interested in getting a full-size pen display. It executes pretty well on what it sets out to do and at a very good price. It's especially nice if you're not a professional and can't really justify paying for something like a Cintiq."", 'Yes, the screen is very smooth, like glass, not paper, and I love it. It seems like it\'s getting harder to find this as time goes on, but honestly I very much prefer it, as I\'m a digital artist before any other kind, and the feel of the pen nib grinding and sanding down and wearing away (on ""like paper"" screens or tablets) just bothers me and makes me not want to draw big or fast lines.I think paper feel can be nice if it\'s a smaller screen, as it helps to give more resistance and control, but I realized with this that there\'s another way of accomplishing that. Because this screen is so large, and the accuracy is good, you have a lot more space to draw over the same resolution and more ""accuracy per pixel"", if that makes sense.In other words, despite a more smooth, nice, glossy surface, you still get your control by essentially having everything more ""zoomed in"" by default, without zooming in. This means when you do zoom in, you can go even further than a smaller screen could, while still seeing the surrounding area or having more precision, and when you don\'t zoom in, it\'s similar to how it would be on smaller tablet zoomed in. It\'s hard to explain, but you can be more loose and free with your lines, and every tiny movement isn\'t as big of a deal, it\'s much more forgiving, so it\'s accomplishing essentially the same thing as resistance from texture would. (Could be nice if you had jittery/shaky hands too.)If you wanted the utmost control, I suppose you could find something with both size and texture, but honestly drawing large lines quickly, dragging fast over a large rough area is going to wear the nib down really fast, plus feel to me like nails on chalkboard slightly, so if you\'re anything like me you\'d always be inclined to slow it down or draw in a smaller area, more carefully, less free.I like to draw large, sweeping, smooth, all in one stroke, flowing lines, rather than a million hairy ones, and I feel this is the perfect balance for that. You can be precise because it\'s over a large area, but also just swoosh the pen around without feeling like it\'s grinding against the screen. My only issue so far is there is a tiny bit of parallax, but it\'s not nearly as much of an issue as I imagined when shopping around. I\'d love one with less of that, but now that I\'ve tried this, I would not sacrifice any of the other features for it.Some said the pixels were too big, but I don\'t notice it, I like crisp pixels anyway but I don\'t even see it regardless, maybe it\'s my vision. If anything, it just means more input accuracy mapped over fewer (larger)  pixels like I said, which for drawing (rather than viewing) seems pretty ideal to me (1920x1080 resolution is plenty for this screen size imo, again especially for drawing). Try to imagine the opposite, a tiny screen where you try to draw, but no matter how careful you are, the pen is covering many pixels at once and the slightest movement (even by the texture of it!) would span many more pixels.In other news, yes you can 100% see your reflection in it when it\'s off, so do beware if glare is a concern - that being said, other screens seem to just blur the reflection, not stop it, so dealing with your lighting situation properly is your best bet anyway if possible.All in all, I love it, and words cannot describe how much better I feel with it than screenless graphics tablets. Some say it\'s not that big of a deal, but I have to wholeheartedly disagree. Trying to explain would just be even  more confusing and long than this review has already gotten, though, so I\'ll leave it at that. Love this thing.', ""We planned to use this for business. It was just a bit too large to carry on business trips, so we'll look for a smaller one. One thing that I forgot to mention in my reason to return, was that this box was missing the extra plugs (international plug, etc.) Being used, I still expected it to have all the parts."", ""I like this tablet and I decided to keep it, but there are a few things everyone should know:1. Per my emails with support, windows scaling is not supported and there are no plans to. That means you are stuck at 100% which is tiny tiny tiny. Most apps have UI scaling though, but windows is a no-go.EDIT: through testing it does scale over USB-C vs USB-A/HDMI splitter cable. Not sure why support wouldn't tell me that.2. The cables are short and they don't sell longer ones. My extensions won't supply power properly or let the pen work without hiccupping.3. The power button only turns the screen off. It remains connected to windows. Your cursor or windows can still move to tablet. The only way to disconnect it from windows is to unplug it from USB.4. If touch won't work make sure you enter PC Tablet Settings in Control Panel to enable the screen.5. It doesn't draw dots well. It doesn't detect pressure sensitivity (under those circumstances) and they come out tiny or large and few in between. You have to set a brush to a size and adjust as needed.EDIT: again over USB-C it drew dots fine. Not sure why the performance is so much poorer through the other cable.6. It doesn't always draw when you expect it to.I decided to keep it because:1. I like the semi-matte surface. I don't like the sound of the scratchy pen tablets with matte surfaces. I came from an HP Spectre and Surface Pro 4 which both have glossy screens and it's definitely more matte than that. It's right between which is really comfortable for me.2. The pen is very good and the drawing experience is great.3. It's cost effective.EDIT: If using over USB-C connection the experience is much better. This requires that you have an integrated iGPU/APU on your desktop processor and a USB-C port on your motherboard or laptop. Without that you are stuck with poor options. I'm upping my rating to 4 stars, but I think the manufacturer and their support can be much more communicative about these requirements and limitations.UPDATE: I decided to return it after all. Not being able to draw dots just doesn't work for my art style and things became very deliberate. If it did that one thing well, I'd keep it for sure but for now it's a deal breaker."", ""Pros:1. Beautiful and Vivid 4k Display with excellent colour accuracy2. Premium feel and unboxing experience (reminds me of unboxing an Apple product)3. Fluid and accurate drawing experience4. The pen case is a great add and I love the simplicity of the pen5. It was very easy to setup both on Windows and MacOS6. It is also the only pen display at this price point with touch controls to my knowledgeCons:1. My unit came with some cosmetic defects despite functioning perfectly however I expect better quality control from such an expensive purchasei. First was the glass being scratched (2 deep scratches and several small hairline scratches that are more superficial)ii. The display was very slightly popped out near the ports on the top side of the device but clicked back in place2. Very little drawing resistance3. Does not include a stand which I believe many devices at this price point do4. Cable management is not the cleanestSummary:I was looking for a drawing tablet with larger working area for drawing and artwork. I was primarily using an 2020 iPad Air previously which is great but does not have a lot of drawing space. I did a lot of research beforehand, what appealed to be about XP-PEN over the other brands available, was price-point with the added touch features and it being a 4K display.The unboxing experience was stellar, well packaged with a beautiful box you will want to keep. It has everything you will need to get started and hooked up to your computer in the box. I tested it with both a newly custom built Windows PC and a Macbook Pro (2018). I'll admit the Windows setup experience seemed far easier to me, but the MacOS setup was not supremely difficult.Upon unpacking the contents of the box, you'll notice everything feels extremely premium. I took out the pen first, because the case is beautiful and is very satisfying to open. It has plenty of tips and an easy to operate tip replacement tool. I saw some complaints online primarily with the pen, being light and round and easy to roll off a desk. But this was not a deal breaker to me. It has a built in eraser which appears to be programmable and one other programmable button. I don't mind the lightness of the pen myself and it works great and is easy to handle.The display itself is beautiful, vivid with excellent colour accuracy. It's what you would expect for a 4K display. The glass is very smooth and while it does have a slight texture to it, it does not provide any resistance when drawing which does take time to get used to. It's almost slippery to draw on at first but I found it very easy to get used to over time. I do see this as being a dealbreaker for some if you like to have more a paper-esque drawing experience. I have only done a few sketches for now, to test it out but a I can see a lot of possibilities as I use it more.I do have some concerns however - my unit did come with some cosmetic defects which I mention in the cons above. I was reading online that this does seem to be a problem at time among all the pen display manufacturers but there were two notable issues with mine. First, there are noticeable scratches on the glass. Two small deep ones and some less noticeable hairline scratches. Second, the screen was slightly popped out near the ports. It did easily pop back into place and does not seem to impact the performance of the device. The box was not opened and was still wrapped in plastic, so I assume the scratches occurred during the manufacturing process. The display popping out could be due to transport, it was somewhat lose in a larger box with other items.Overall I'm happy with the XP-PEN Artist Pro 16TP so far, I just wish it would have come without the cosmetic issues, considering that is still a very expensive device. Hopefully you find this review helpful and I'll try to update it over time if I notice anything else."", ""Now, I will say this caveat: I have only been using this for a single day so far. However, it has already expanded my ability to complete art more competently and quickly. Using a setup guide on youtube, I was able to quickly get it set up to my computer. Note, if you do not have a USB-C connection, you will have to use both a USB and a HDMI port on your computer to be able to use this tablet. As I have three screens, I also had to get a display port to HDMI adaptor to be able to get all three screens to work right.For the screen itself, it is easily the best screen in my setup. Colors are vibrant, and the tablet is bright. As an art surface, the screen is a little glassy, which does make me miss the paper tactile feel of my old Wacom Pen and Ink. However, it is pretty easy to move past. I look forward to making lots of art on this!Pros:Large, beautiful screen. If you haven't spoiled yourself with 2.5 or 4K resolution, then you won't really notice the resolution that much if at all. it provides ample room to work on a piece as well as be able to manipulate menus and tools.A complete package: This comes with everything you need to start using it, minus desktop or laptop. All cables, a pen, microfiber cleaning cloth, and even an artist glove. Its an excellent value for the moneyResponsive Tablet: I haven't noticed parallax in my use of it, nor noticeable delay in lines.Cons:The Setup: While initial setup was very easy, this is a tablet that may require a lot of tuning to get it to the point that you like it in regards to the shortcuts on the pen and setting it up with the art program. Its not bad, but it did create a learning curve that I am still struggling withThe pen: once again, not bad, but after using a Wacom stylus for years, it feels a little sloppy. The buttons on it aren't very tactile, and the default programmed shortcuts were not really the ones I want. Not hard to fix, but a slight annoyance."", 'The monitor works well but there was no pen or pen holder in the package thankfully the pen from the  XPPen Deco mini4 worked on it the holder would be nice but was not stressing then today I adjusted the stand to a new position and heard a snap now the screen only stays in the full down position and will not stay upright.I can not go without as of right now as I have a job I need to work on so will deal with it. Wish I could leave a better review but with missing parts and broken parts I will give it 3 for now as the drawing still works with the Deco pen.', 'It\'s quality. The metal backing, the buttons feel tactful, everything screams ""I am high end"". I think it carried over to their cables though. Because the HDMI cable that\'s part of the 3 in 1 cable, over engineers the HDMI head, giving it a wide body so if you plug this into a PC with a GPU you\'re not going to have much space around that one HDMI slot to fit any other Displayport, or HDMI cable. Really frustrating. Can\'t even use an older Artist Display 15.6 cable to get around the wide HDMI cable', 'Where can I start? I got it for my birthday as an early gift.I love this thing. It is large compared to the other ones I\'ve gotten but that just makes it even better. Certainly a stay-at-home type device since there\'s no way for me to safely transport and because of how large it is./My only issue is that while plugged in to the laptop, no sound comes from the laptop nor thr tablet; but I\'m almost 100% certain that its my fault./{Edit 11/03: for this, no sound should come from the tablet itself. It was a setting issue on the laptop, not the tablet. An easy fix by going into your computer settings and setting the sound to your computer because it wants to go with the tablet for sound.}Smooth, and every now and again it\'ll uncoordinate; but that\'s such an easy fix.Does not portray the same colors as what\'s on my screen (always darker for some reason?).{Edit 11/03: A dark screen is unfixable. No matter how much you fiddle, it\'ll look brighter on the computer/laptop. Not too big of a difference tho so I got use to it pretty fast. Just a quick screen-look to make sure its the colors you want to use and your set.}Tbh I was so worried by the negative reviews about this thing but dived in anyway (with a warranty) and I\'m so happy I did. I love this thing so much. Even with the ""darker tones"" it portrays, it\'s still so easy to work around it (but if anyone has a fix lemme know please).EDIT: 8/03/2020So the lighting issue can\'t really be fixed, or at least to my knowledge. It\'s still dim but that\'s fine.The wires are annoying but nothing is broke surprisingly. By this time, my bamboo tablets would have required at /least/ 2 replacement cables, 5 nibs and maybe an extra pen.This thing is a godsend. The cables aren\'t torn, however, the cable ports are loose and if it\'s resting on the cables might unplug it, but I don\'t seem to have too much of an issue with it either way. I was at least worried that the screen would scratch up because of use (none of my bamboo tablets lasted more than a year and a half). Worth every penny to me. I just wish it would stay at the 350 or below mark so I could get more for my friends.EDIT: 7/13/2021Still going strong! Wires still wiggly in the port but works just as fine as ever! Haven\'t had to replace the nibs once on the pen so far, and I feel like I rarely if ever charge the pens! Love it still <3']"

Die Haptik ist nur nicht so gut wie bei Mäusen um die 50€, was aber natürlich klar sein sollte. Das Mausrad ist mir persönlich etwas zu groß, obwohl ich schon recht große Hände habe. Ansonsten macht sie genau das was sie soll und sogar Zocken ist ohne Einschränkungen möglich.', 'Actually decent mouse, no need for expensive ones.', 'Molto contento. Grazie Amazon', 'Ich kenne die Marke schon länger, denn wir haben hier schon einige Jahre zwei Funktastatur mit Maus-Sets im Einsatz und auch Solo-Funk-Mäuse. Vor drei Jahren hat sich meine andere Hälfte vor Ort ein Set gekauft für gerade mal 10,00. Ich fand selbiges so gut und preiswert dass ich mir für den PC ebenfalls eines nachgekauft habe. Zum Surfen, wenig Schreiben und Spielen mehr als ausreichend. Und weil die Mäuse echt gut waren habe ich mir dann hier bei Amazon vor zwei Jahren noch vier für damalige gerade 6,00 nachgekauft (Rapoo M10 Wireless Optical Maus (2,4 GHz, 1000 DPI) in schwarz und weiß. Mittlerweile kosten diese schon das Doppelte.Die kleine VPRO V16 Optische Gaming Maus kommt im Gegensatz zu anderen Mäusen des Herstellers in Blisterverpackung in einem schicken Karton an. Sie ist nicht zu leicht oder schwer und auch recht handlich. Alles wirkt gut verarbeitet. Das Kabel ist schön lang, aber etwas steif. Dank des kleinen Klettbandes kann man sich die Länge einstellen, damit es nicht stört.Sie wurde schnell und ohne Probleme per Plug & Play unter Win10 erkannt.Die Beleuchtung stört mich weniger, da ich meistens Gamingmäuse mit Beleuchtung nutze und Abends im dunklen Zimmer spiele.Gut auch dass man hier die dpi einstellen kann mit einem kleinen Tastendruck zwischen 750, 1350 und 2000. Ich nutze meistens so Einstellungen zwischen 1500 und 2000 dpi. Darüber sind die mir meistens schon zu schnell.Auch praktisch sind die beiden seitlichen Tasten für Vor- und Zurück. Beim Surfen zum Beispiel sehr praktisch wenn man öfters die Seiten hin und her wechseln muss.Außerdem läuft sie prima leicht auf meinem Stoffmauspads. Auf meinem beleuchteten Kunststoffpad hat sie aber wie einige andere auch Probleme und schabt.Ich habe zum Vergleich beide anderen Mäuse von Rapoo, die wir bereits haben, mal angeschlossen und ausprobiert und den Druckpunkt der beiden Maustasten und die Gängigkeit des Mausrades mit dieser hier verglichen. Das A und O sind nun ein mal diese drei Funktionen. Und leider schneidet die VPRO V16 echt schlecht ab. Das Mausrad geht schwer und rattert dabei auch hörbar. Und während ich hier die linke Maustaste ein mal drücke, schaffe ich es bei den anderen beiden günstigeren leise und leicht drei mal und mehr. Außerdem hört man diese hier auch laut klicken.Zum Spielen ist sie damit für mich eher ungeeignet und eher noch maximal was für so chillige Spiele wie Minecraft oder Sims geeignet, maximal für Runden-basierende Games wie Drakensang. Wenn es aber echt auf Zeit ankommt und Technik wie bei Witcher zum Beispiel ist diese hier ungeeignet.Fazit: Ich habe hier einige Mäuse liegen von billig bis teuer. Preislich kann man aber nicht sagen ob so eine Kleine wirklich gut ist und zu den Bedürfnissen passt. Optisch und haptisch ist die Maus gut. Sie liegt gut in der Hand und gleitet auch gut. Allerdings in dem wichtigsten Punkt Schnelligkeit und Genauigkeit der Tasten und Leichtgängigkeit des Mausrades, konnte sie mich leider nicht überzeugen. Da wurde sie sogar von einem günstigeren Funk-Modell aus dem eigenen Haus, der Rapoo M10 Wireless Optical Maus um Längen geschlagen.', 'Diese Maus von VPRO überzeugt aufgrund des Preises.Die wichtigste Frage, wie akkurat ist eine Maus?Genügt es pixelgenauem Arbeiten und ist sie gut genug für einen Egoshooter?Also ich habe eine 70 Euro Gaming-Maus, die den Preis wert ist (aber jetzt langam zugestaubt ist, dass der rechte Button nicht mehr geht). Man merkt schon, dass es einen kleinen Unterschied gibt zu dieser. Aber er ist nur gering, ich habe bei Battlefield 3 dasselbe Spielgefühl und Score wie mit meiner alten Maus. Mein Gefühl sagt mir, die 70 Euro Maus ist flüssiger in der Bewegung. Aber diese von VPRO reicht aus, und überrascht sogar. Ich habe viele Mäuse für unter 20 Euro bereits ausprohiert. Da schneidet diese hier wirklich besser ab. Und mein Eindruck ist, man kann alle Spiele damit spielen.Die Maustasten 4+5 befinden sich links. Aber keine entsprechenden Seitentasten rechts! Das heisst, Linkshänder werden den kleinen oder Ringfinger benutzen müssen bei dieser Maus, um diese Seitentasten zu drücken. Naja, ich bezweifle dass das gut geht.Die Drückflächen für Maustaste links und rechts sind leicht angerauht, was sich nicht schlecht anfühlt. Aber ich habe mich an die glatte Oberfläche meiner alten Mau gewöhnt gehabt. Mal sehn, ob ich mich umngewöhne oder dieses rauhe Gefühl unter den Fingern ein klein wenig störend bleibt.Edit: Nach einigen Wochen kann ich sagen, dass das Klickgeräusch etwas lauter ist als bei meiner alten Gaming Mouse. Aber ich bin ddennoch zufrieden.Das LED Licht bei der Maus ist rot und lässt sich nicht ändern.DPI maximal 2000. Der Umschalter für die DPI Zahl ist oben auf der Maus wie üblich und kennt drei Stufen (750, 1350, 2000 dpi).1,80 m USB Kabel erfreulich lang und verstärkt (Stoffumantelung).Übrigens: In der Beschreibung des Artikels steht eetwas von 5 Volt, evtl. irreführend und an Batterie erinnernd; nur für den Fall: man braucht hier keine Extrabatterie. Alles über USB:Leider kann auch diese Maus nicht aufgeschraubt werden um sie von Staub zu bereien.Edit: Im März 2017  erhalten, im Januar 2018 hat sich die Seitenmousetaste (Mousetaste 4) verabschiedet. Dabei habe ich die Mouse mit diesen Seiten-Tasten nicht ausserordentlich oft oder hart benutzt. Finde aber die Seitentasten sehr wichtig. Naja, ich habe eine 70 Euro Gaming Maus, da musste ich nach einem Jahr stark ""drauf klopfen"", damit die rechte Maustaste wieder funzt. Das waren harte Schläge, bis es funzte (wohl Staub), aber sie hat es ausgehalten. Muss man sich überlegen. Ich bin der Meinung, diese Maus hier ist in der Akkuratheit der 70 Euronen Maus gleichzustellen, mit ein bisschen Abstrichen. Was wäre meine nächste Maus? Ganz ehrlich, wieder eine 70 Euro Maus.', 'Mir hat meine kleine Maus, welche bei meinem Gaming PC dabei war, immer ausgereicht. Sie war einfach, schlicht und hat gut reagiert. So sah ich keinen Bedarf für eine ""richtige"" Gaming Maus.Nun wurde mir die VPRO angeboten und ich muss sagen, dass es schon einen Unterschied gibt.Folgende Vorteile sind mir aufgefallen:+++ Die Maus reagiert sehr schnell. Besonders, wenn man die DPI höher stellt. Bei 750 (Stufe 1) reagiert sie ganz ""normal"". Stufe 2 mit  1350 ist genau richtig zum Spielen. Die höchste Stufe bei 2000 DPI ist mir zu schnell.Aber mal sehen, vielleicht habe ich auch einfach nicht das passende Spiel ;-)+++ Das Kabel ist stoffummantelt, dicker und stabiler als andere. Es ist trotz der Dicke sehr flexibel und erfreulich lang.+++ Das Rädchen, die Tasten und die Optik der Maus reagieren einwandfrei. Kein hakeln etc. .++ Die Maus leuchtet in einem schönen rot/orange. Das passt perfekt zu meiner beleuchteten Tastatur. Ja, so kleine Dinge können einem Freude machen.++ Die Mausoberfläche hat einen leichten Grip. Abrutschen wird man in der Hektik nicht.---- Fazit ----Eine tolle Gaming Maus, welche sich als super Allrounder herausgestellt hat. Und das für kleines Geld!', 'Von einer Gaming-Maus für 15 Euro erwarte ich eigentlich nicht wirklich viel. Schon das mit Stoff ummantelte, lange Kabel überrascht positiv, ebenso der Klettverschluss mit dem man das Kabel auf die benötigte Länge zurecht binden kann.Treiber ist keiner notwendig, in den USB-Port einstecken und die Maus funktioniert einwandfrei. Was natürlich einfach und bequem ist hat natürlich auch den Nachteil, dass man keine gesonderten Einstellungen vornehmen kann. Insbesondere das farbig pulsierende Licht lässt sich nicht abschalten, wer kein Fan dieses Features ist – wie ich – muss leider damit leben. Wer damit kein Problem hat darf der Maus gerne den fünften Stern noch anrechnen.Die Maus ist recht lang und liegt gut in der Hand – auch in meinen großen Händen. Die Oberfläche ist angenehm und die Maus gleitet gut über mein Mousepad. Die Abtastung ist erstaunlich präzise, kann mit teureren Mäusen aber dennoch nicht ganz mithalten. Für die meisten Spieler und Spiele sollte dies aber ausreichend. Auch der Anschlag der Tasten ist angenehm und leise und das Mausrad ist leicht gerastert.Fazit: Tolle Einsteigermaus zu einem richtig guten Preis. Mich stört allerdings das nicht abschaltbare, pulsierende Licht, sonst volle fünf Sterne.', 'Große Unterschiede zwischen dieser Maus und einer normalen Maus konnte ich nicht feststellen.Ein wesentlicher Unterschied ist vielleicht, dass man drei verschiedene dpi-Stufen einstellen kann. Das bedeutet, man kann variieren, ob eine Bewegung der Maus normale, weiträumige oder engräumige Cursorbewegungen zur Folge hat. Das kann eine gewisse Erleichterung sein, jedoch benötigt man dies für normale PC-Games nicht.Die Beleuchtung ist kein wirklicher Vorteil, sie stört eher. Besonders originell ist sie auch nicht.Die verschiedenen dpi-Stufen sehe ich hier als einzigen wirklichen Vorteil gegenüber normalen Mäusen. Man sollte sich vor dem Kauf überlegen, ob man dies wirklich benötigt.']"

A couple of the less-important keys (F13, F14) went out on me recently so while I like that keyboard a lot I figured it was time for a new one. I wanted USB/wired not wireless, backlighting, a numeric keypad and ideally a somewhat compact design since I do most of my work at a desk with a somewhat narrow keyboard drawer on which I also place my mouse pad and mouse. This ""iMBAPrice"" keyboard fit the bill and at only $20 looked like a bargain. The reviews were mixed but I decided to give it a shot.I do like the backlighting very much. My home office space is pretty dark even during the day and at night I don\'t like to work under bright lights. The orange color is nice with lights on in the room and the blue appears more muted to my eyes and so works nicely in the dark. My very old 2003 Mac PowerBook G4 has backlit keys and I loved them; that computer has been retired for a while but I always liked the backlighting and have missed it. The backlighting on the PowerBook is of much higher quality, though, with the ability to manually adjust the brightness, allow the brightness to adjust based on ambient light, and the high quality keys and key fonts never wore out. This keyboard has lights which are either on or off, orange or blue, and that\'s it – fine with me, although I would have expected things to get fancier in 14 years, not simpler. (Well, this is a $20 keyboard...) I do think the fonts on the keys are going to wear fast, though: In fact, two of the special function keys had tiny little pinpricks worn away before I ever touched those keys and while I was able to fix them with an application of some black magic marker that won\'t be possible once the key fonts start to go (as reported in other reviews).It\'s definitely less wide than my old Mac keyboard. The Mac keyboard was 17"" wide (x axis) while this keyboard is a smidge under 16"" wide. It is larger in both the y and z axis. Z (height) is another thing I need to get used to as it makes my wrist angle and elbow placement a little different.The keys themselves are a little larger than I\'m used to but I\'ve worked on keyboards with similar-size keys. The fonts on the keys are HUGE and I like that, it was a selling point for me and in practice it\'s certainly easy on the eyes – to the extent I look at the keys, which isn\'t often. I AM glancing at the keys a bit as I write this because the layout isn\'t 100% standard and since I started using it only today I\'m not used to it yet. Just look at the pictures and you can see that in order to make the keyboard less long that the layout keys are clustered to the right of the main keys and some of the keys, such as the Enter key, are not standard size. I am a touch-typist so this is slowing me down but i do see getting used to it. People with less dexterous plasticity might find the non-standard layout frustrating and should look elsewhere.I\'m using this keyboard with a Mac and while it\'s not a Mac-specific keyboard it works perfectly fine. System Preferences will allow you to reassign the Windows, Control, and Alt keys if you want to do that. I didn\'t as I\'m OK with the keys being in different locations as long as they\'re labeled more-or-less for their actual assigned function. I own a copy of a lovely piece of software called USB Overdrive so I was able to assign all the special function keys (volume-up, play/pause, etc.) to functions that are useful to me, although most of them (such as the mail button opening my Mail application) worked right out of the box so should be fine for people happy with the default functions of those keys.None of the keys on my keyboard stick or rock or are hard to press. They all have a VERY long travel, though, and kind of clack-sounding when I\'m typing at speed, and the size of the keys (a bit larger than I\'m used to) is throwing me off a little. My main concern is that the entire thing feels cheap, the keys feel cheap as I depress them, and I\'m concerned about how this low quality device might result in me working slower and introducing more errors in my work. I fully expect that things are going to wear out pretty fast (especially the fonts etched into the keys which allow the light to come through – boy, that will look terrible when they start to go) and I imagine the keyboard as a whole won\'t last very long. But you know, it\'s $20 and you do get what you pay for.A replacement keyboard of the exact same type I have been using for 10 years is still available from Apple for $50 but I\'m already thinking that in the future, no backlight equals no way am I purchasing that keyboard. If/when this cheap backlit keyboard craps out I\'d like to find an Apple-layout keyboard with quality keys and backlighting. They do exist but are over $100 which would be well worth it to me for something that would maintain its appearance and function for at least 5 years but most, even top-of-the-line keyboards such as the Logitech K800 (not Mac-specific, proprietary wireless instead of USB or Bluetooth, but only $65 or so) have a lot of reports of lifespans only in the 12-month range.Please note that my 4-star rating is based on the quality and price combined, my renewed love of keyboard backlighting, and the fact that it fits on my desk and the somewhat nonstandard layout is not a major problem for me. If not considering the price at all, I\'d probably knock off a star; maybe two.Also note that this exact keyboard is sold here on Amazon under a variety of different brand names and prices. Look at the specs and pictures carefully to be sure and choose the one currently being sold for the lowest price; that\'s what I did.edit 2017-04-11: Knocking off a star because even though this is a compact keyboard the keys themselves are large enough that the distance my fingers have to reach to go from one key to another or to hold a modifier key and press another key with one hand is very large. Much more awkward than on any other keyboard I\'ve used in the last 20 years. Thinking about going back to the Apple USB keyboard with keypad even though it doesn\'t have backlighting and costs $50.edit 2017-04-14: The long key travel and the huge space between keys have me working much slower and with less accuracy. The nonstandard layout and couple of nonstandard keys aren\'t a problem but I can\'t take this big a hit to my productivity. The keyboard is just too cheap; I guess i shouldn\'t expect any better from a $20 device. It\'s going back into it\'s little box and into my storage cabinet. It will be perfectly fine as an emergency replacement keyboard but I need to use something better for my everyday work and play.', 'Works very smooth, like the keys size just wished whole board with a little bit longer, keys seem cramped. Last one was longer, of course it was a different make.', 'Très bien !!!', ""I use this for office work, early in the morning, and backlit keys are exactly what I need for visibility so this keyboard is great. Plug and play. My spouse likes it as well as I got her one. I kept wearing off the letters of my old keyboards so this is a big improvement. I touch type but it is nice to be able to glance at it once in a while. I did find the right shift and enter key small compared to other keyboards. I haven't managed to quite get used to the keyboard yet as my previous one had a larger keys for enter and shift and I do hit the arrow keys sometimes instead of shift. Definitely takes a little getting used to but the illumination is ideal. Easy on my aging eyes."", 'Good unit for this price. The keys light-up nicely. My problem is the ""Enter"" key is shortened and not the last key on that row, so I miss it sometimes. Rogjt next to it is the ""Home"" ksy. This means grabbibg the mouse to return the cursor back to the end of my tezt before I can continue.Also, the backapace is not the top-right key, so I have to stop and look at my fingers to hit it.', 'Seems to be a good Keyboard but the dimension in the description does not match.

It has the odd roll over due to age but it\'s a great keyboard.Bought two of these similar ones when on sale.The ""LED"" button changes backlit color and will turn off the backlit function when held for a few seconds.Key noise is moderate but the backlit is perfect when working in low light.I\'m an old fart with reading glasses. I don\'t think that I can use anything else now...I\'m spoiled with the large backlit font. :)', 'I loved it, with the larger letters and backlight it\'s great for me tired old eyes.My only complaint is that the actual keys for the Shift and delete on the right of the keyboard are very narrow so I\'m continuously making errors but I\'m getting used to it.And then it happened, my work computer died every time I tried to type. Tried it o my home unit, same thing. Probably nothin really but I had to call the manufacturer cause it was older than 30 days. As soon as I said I had an issue they hung up the phone, twice.So I contacted Amazon and they took it back for credit, which I\'ve gotten already.Now I\'m scared to order another similar but ""different"" brand and pay more.Don\'t bother.', ""Lights up and looks really nice in the blue. Nice small size. Works fine. Cheap feel, and chintzy sound to the keystroke so it can't get a 3 star on the ergonomic scale. A good backup 20 dollar keyboard is what it is, and it's fine at that.

Like other reviewers have said, there is a bit of bagginess but you can easily secure that with clear tape (tape is easily removable from any computer; I\'m using this for my work computer, which is a little old Fujitsu).This is the perfect item for someone who has a somewhat ""unknown"" computer model, or one that isn\'t a Mac. The normal keyboard skins are great for Macs, but pretty hard to find for laptops that are not Macs, and trying to fit them (if you do find them) can be tricky.This is sheer enough to see the keys, but if you\'re a hero that can type fluidly without hunting down the letter keys, you have nothing to fear.The cost is worth it, and definitely not high. I love that I have an extra one for the day that my current one is no longer usable.  It\'s easily wiped with a damp sponge, and because I can be a little overzealous, it protects my computer from too much damp-sponge-wiping (i.e. frying the keyboard).I hope this product continues to be made.', 'I have a Logitech K350 wireless, ergo keyboard. This is not a perfect fit, but does the job. I’ve only had it on for about a week, but it doesn’t disrupt my typing.

I ordered the wrong one. I Ordered the correct keyboard after buying this item. I was saddly disappointed  when I got this. I pulled tight as I could and it did not form around the keys unlike the first covered ordered. You get 3 in the box.  Even taping the four sides didn't help. It reminded me of saran wrap; much thinner. I need to be more careful with what I order. I would have given no stars if it were available. Not worth the money.I wonder if they ever thought of making covers for printers.

This keyboard cover is the best thing since a hot slice of home made bread and butter. it's thin enough that I can easily see my keys, when necessary, and I can type without having to pound to get through the tough fitted keyboard covers.I can understand why some people wouldn't like it, but for this old girl's hands, it's a dream.

My old one was spoilt (R key malfunction) and I was searching for a similar one and was so happy to find this one - exactly the same! :)"", ""Bought it to connect to a broken laptop where Windows 10 was disabling the integrated keyboard. Well, good news, it works when connected to every laptop I tried it on except that broken laptop. Not Perixx's issue, but Lenovo's piece of crap Ideapad."", ""Update: I tried the Macally (Macally USB Wired Keyboard for Mac and Windows PC) on Linux and Windows.It works perfectly and is so much better than this keyboard I can't believe it. For $20 more (or $10 if you use the coupon) the build quality is far superior, the keys are much better, and it's quieter.I just bought 2 more of the Macally - just in case they stop making them. But compared to this keyboard it's like the NYY vs my little league team.Original Reviewtldr - For anyone who wants a simple mini wired keyboard at a low price that works on Windows and Linux, this is it.History - started on old school desktop keyboards (long travel and loud), moved to laptop keyboards (short travel and pretty much silent), then used a Magic Keyboard and never went back, until now.I got a new Proart p248qv monitor which has DVI, Display Port, VGA, and HDMI connections.At first I was just using my Macbook Pro with a Magic Keyboard and a Logitec m557 bluetooth mouse via the Display port, and all was well.I then added a dual boot windows/ubuntu machine via the HDMI port and it was awesome, no KVM switch and the big 3 operating systems working a great monitor.But, I needed another mouse and keyboard. Mouse was easy (Logitec m100 that's been laying around for years), but the keyboard wasn't.I have an old Anker bluetooth keyboard that was a $20 knock off of the magic keyboard, and while it wasn't as nice it certainly worked very well.The problem was when switching between Windows and Ubuntu the bluetooth connection would be lost, so I'd have to turn the keyboard off and then on again, which was fine...until it wasn't.Basically in the span of about a week both Windows a Ubuntu wouldn't connect with the on/off solution, so I had to re-pair...not so fine, but still workable.After a few days the keyboard stopped asking for a specific pin and just wanted me to enter one...looking around I found that entering six zeros (000000) was the fix.This worked for about, well, I'd say once. Then the keyboard wouldn't connect to either OS no matter what I did.Enter the 407W.It just works. No batteries, no reconnecting, no sudden dropped and the reappearing bluetooth connections.The keyboard itself (not the keys) is very shiny and slippery. It's a bit higher off the desk than it's portrayed in the pictures and it somehow feels flatter than a Magic Keyboard.The key aren't clicky...they're...sort of loud(ish), certainly not as quiet as a laptop keyboard - basically the Anker sounded pretty much the same. It's a cheap keyboard and it's got that cheap keyboard sound - sort of clicky when typing fast yet hollow at the same time. It would probably drive me nuts if I were in an office and everyone had this keyboard, but I really don't mind it.It's a bit taller and wider than a Magic Keyboard (due to the Page Up, Page Down, etc. keys on the right).The keys are spaced a little bit farther away from each other than the MK and they're definitely taller yet smaller. They also aren't as flat as the MK...there's just a tiny (probably 1/2 of a mm slope towards the middle of the keys, which I don't mind at all (in fact it's kind of nice).Overall I don't mind any of the above, the keyboard has a proper Windows layout (for a mini keyboard) that works the same in Windows and Ubuntu, it does have page up/page down, etc. keys, there are no problems with connections, and it was really inexpensive.The only other option I've been intrigued by is the PERIBOARD-326, which is black, but with backlit keys (although apparently they're closer together, and smaller).If you're on the fence just try the 407 - it's pretty basic, and it's pretty great.If it broke (which it will) I'd get a new one asap."", ""Update 4/12/2017: I recently received my second Periboard-407, this time in the Piano Black finish. I liked the white unit I reviewed below, and long ago learned to buy a backup when I find a daily use item that I like.Several items of note about the black unit:1. The issue I mentioned with light bleed between and around the lock LEDs is completely absent. I don't know if it's just he dark plastic, or if they made another change (such as darker lens or dimmer LED), but the lights are now distinct, while still bright enough to be clear.2. Something I neglected to mention in my previous review was that the keyboard had a rather short cable. I haven't yet compared the two, but upon installing my new black unit, I no longer needed to use the short USB extension I had used with the white keyboard, so it appears to me the cord is longer. Not sure if this indicates variance between units in manufacturing, a change in design, or a difference between the black and white units, but I appreciate the longer cord. Hopefully it's the norm for all newer units.Now that I have a second sample, it appears that the quality of the first keyboard was probably not a fluke -- the new unit has a solid build, with good anti-slip feet, and no blemishes.The feel of this new keyboard is, if anything, superior to the first I received, which is why I've swapped the white unit out already. Well, that, and I find it best to test my backups before trusting they'll be there when I need them!Finally, while it looks very nice, there are the expected downsides to the piano black finish, of course: the case is a fingerprint magnet, and the blue special function labels are not nearly as readable as on the white keyboard. The normal key legend is clear, though. OTOH, the white keyboard will likely be more prone to staining over time, if my previous experience with light colored keyboards is any indication.I'm not sure which keyboard will retain its role as my daily driver -- the black, with the slightly crisper touch, or the white, with the slightly better visibility in low light.I now feel that, on balance, given the combination of feel, features, layout, and value for the price, this keyboard is worth fully four stars. If it holds up well over time, perhaps a bit higher.Original review:Surprisingly good, given the price and the quality of most similar keyboards.I was looking for a compact keyboard to use in rotation with my main keyboard (a Max Keyboards Blackbird with Cherry Brown key switches ... 5 stars). I am a programmer (both day job and as a hobby), so I also wanted decent feel and can't do without the navigation keys (though I'm flexible as to position, since I've used laptops for many years). I love my mechanical keyboards, but 1) I need to use different keyboards occasionally, to reduce the effects of my RSI, and 2) my home office is adjoining our bedrooms, and even the Cherry Browns I have in all my mechanical boards are far from quiet!The Periboard-407 certainly isn't perfect, since it has bog standard rubber dome key switches. That said, they aren't completely dead feeling -- I'd place them on the high side of average.Key layout is good, with a pretty standard laptop style stack of nav keys to the right, which is fine. As with way too many keyboards, they do make the mistake of putting the audio controls on the opposite side from the Fn key, making it a two hand gesture to pause/resume playback. I really don't understand why the designers don't realize how handy it would be to be able to pause with one hand. On the up side, Sleep, Mute, and the volume keys *are* within easy stretch from the Fn key.One nice feature most compact keyboards leave out is the laptop style embedded ten-key pad. Handy for many people, either because a program expects it (e.g., Blender), for entering special symbols in Windows, or for data entry.Honestly, I'd probably only give this a 3.8 if there were better options, but I can easily round to 4 given that there are not. Heck, the fact that they didn't forget the lock LEDs is enough to make me not regret having to round up.If Perixx did a rework of this keyboard, I'd request they consider the following improvements. Hitting all or most of them would bring this inexpensive keyboard up to five stars, and make it worth a higher price as well.1. Change to scissors key switches, as any decent laptop and the best non-mechanical keyboards use. That would improve the feel by eliminating key wobble. Maybe update the rubber domes to give a bit more feedback.2. Move the search, email, and web functions to F9, F10, and F11, and shift the media keys left three places to make them easier to reach with one hand.3. Consider swapping the Insert and Delete key -- I'd much rather accidentally hit Insert when I miss Home than Delete!4. For the White version, do something to either reduce or contain the lock LEDs. Caps Lock LED causes both Num Lock and Scroll Lock to be lit dimly. Not as much of an issue with the Black version, but it happens there, too. Please don't remove the LEDs though!Again, for the price, this is a pleasant surprise -- well worth the money, that's for sure."", 'Mini tastiera usb non credo wirelessComoda come tastiera in caso di postazione aggiuntiva temporanea', ""This keyboard would be perfect, if not for the manufacturer's insistance that it must lie flat on the desk. That gives me pain in my wrists in two minutes. Nothing is lost: two pairs of erasers made of rubber can fix the problem. The full solution involves some removable BluTack at the surface where the rubber touches the keyboard. An UHU adhesive keeps the two rubbers together. All this fuss could have been avoided if there little legs, like on most other keyboards.I still give it full stars, because I'm happy with the result and I bought a second one. The keyboard as a whole takes much less space than a standard 101 key. So the second one can be accommodated on my Working From Home desk. The keys are large: I'm at pension age, and I can hit them almost without looking. The white letters are visible in low light."", 'If you pay more than 25.00 it is a rip!!!', 'I purchased this keyboard back in April 2017 to replace my full-sized Logitech K270, and it was my daily driver at work for a year and nine months (see UPDATE below). Perixx omitted the 10-keypad and relocated the cursor/navigation keys to a single column on the far-right, significantly reducing the overall width of the keyboard (compared to its full-sized brethren). This reduces the distance my right arm must move when switching between typing and controlling the mouse, which was the primary reason I purchased it in the first place.I purchased the wired model for several reasons:1) The wired model costs less than the wireless equivalent;2) I\'m using it at a static desktop workstation 100% of the time;3) My Logitech MX Master mouse has already had problems with interference coming from my workstation\'s USB 3.0 ports (had to buy a USB extension cable to move the dongle away from the 3.0 ports and closer to my mouse); and4) The idea of having two separate dongles for my keyboard and mouse just felt ridiculous.Regarding the overall keyboarding experience, there\'s nothing remarkably good or bad to report. It\'s an inexpensive keyboard with membrane switches. Compared to your basic cheap wired keyboard that comes for free with a Dell workstation, the Perixx keyboard requires slightly less physical travel (but slightly more force) to actuate keys while providing slightly more audible and tactile feedback when keys are released (it\'s not noticeably loud, but this is not a \'silent\' keyboard). I can touch-type with very little effort, though I wish the home key ""bumps"" on the [F] and [J] keys were more pronounced.The only disadvantages are pretty minor:1) Due to some unconventional key placement, I occasionally mash the [Fn] key when I mean to press the [Windows] key. I\'ve resolved this by affixing a tiny square of gaffer\'s tape to the [Windows] key, so I can differentiate it from the [Fn] key by feel.2) The multimedia functions don\'t have their own keys (you must hold the [Fn] key while pressing the corresponding F-key to control multimedia features). This isn\'t so much a shortcoming; it\'s part of the design to keep the footprint small, but I\'ve found it to be enough of a hassle that I just use my mouse to raise/lower volume or switch tracks on my playlists.3) This keyboard is purely USB plug-and-play (no additional software included or available), so there\'s no easy way to re-assign multimedia shortcuts or re-map unused keys to other functions (I\'ve used AutoHotKey to re-map the [CapsLock] key so that pressing it launches Windows Task View).4) After over a year of use, the printed labels on several keys have worn away.5) Uhhhhh.... It\'s not mechanical or even scissor-switch...? But for the price, I can hardly complain.In summary, this is a solid choice if you\'re looking for a space saving non-specialty keyboard or trying to up your ergonomic game a bit. It\'s lasted far longer than I expected.2019-01-25 UPDATE: After 21 months of near-daily use, the keyboard has developed intermittent issues with several keys not registering when I press them (most notably the left [Ctrl] key), so I\'ve replaced it with a Velocifire tenkeyless mechanical keyboard. Bummer, but still not bad at all for $17.', 'After reading reviews on all kinds of mini keyboards on Amazon, I decided on this keyboard to use with my tablet, which has a full-sized USB port.PROS:-better than my fancy bluetooth keyboard-lightweight, fairly compact-spacious, with dedicated del, home, pg up, pg down, end keys-inexpensiveCONS:-makes clickity-clackity noises (if this bothers you or others)-wired (if you\'re looking for WIRELESS keyboards. yes the picture is misleading, but I wanted a WIRED one)I owned a bluetooth keyboard, but when I used it, it would lag a lot, skip around, and think that I held down keys for longer than I did. Like ""thissssss.""The Perixx PERIBOARD-407B, Mini Keyboard worked like a charm - mainly because it was WIRED, which meant it has no problems ""talking"" to the tablet. I can be confident that what I type is registered immediately. It was a huge plus that the keyboard comes with dedicated home, pg up, pg down, end, delete, and backspace buttons, which I thought was worth the larger frame. A lot of the smaller keyboards sacrifice these and replace them with the function-buttons, which is a hastle.The keys are meaty but not hard to press.The keys also have a satisfying sound; it\'s NOT silent as some people prefer, but I like hearing the keys when I type. It adds assurance. I prefer this to those ultra-slim mac-inspired keyboards that feel flimsy; though if you\'re a self-conscious person in a dead-silent library, I can understand how they might be ""too loud."" I use mine mostly from the comfort of my bed, but have used it in small tea houses without anyone staring at me.The cord is about 4.25 feet long, which is longer than I needed for use with my tablet (I could have been fine with 1 foot, but I\'m not complaining.) I wrap up the excess with a tie and can tape it to the bottom of the keyboard. It\'s not the prettiest solution but I don\'t think $14 buys much elegance.The size of the keyboard makes it feel scaped-out enough, unlike some of the other minis that are very cramped. It fits in my laptop bag easily, and is surprisingly lightweight.Now the best part: The price. $14 when I bought it, probably goes on sale for $12. Low enough price so that I\'m not concerned with it getting accidentally scratched or dropped on the ground. Sometiems I cram it into my overpacked laptop bag with books and a tablet, and am not worried about the keys getting jostled or smashed. It\'s not so cheap that I think it\'ll conk out on me anytime soon either.']"
